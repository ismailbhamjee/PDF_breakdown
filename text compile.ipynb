      " In the name of God, whose assistance we humbly beseech and implore, we shall  begin by describing the Island of Andalus,—a country whose excellences are so  numerous, and of such a kind, that they cannot easily be contained within the limits  of abook, and that no words can be found sufficiently strong to give an idea of  them.

      " East and West.\n",
      "Respecting the etymology of its name different opinions prevail ; some authors, Etymology of  like Ibnu Sa’id,' derive it from Andalus, son of Tubal, son of Yafeth, son of Nuh, « Andalus.”  who settled in it, and gave it his name, in like manner as his brother Sebt, son  of Yafeth, peopled the opposite land, and gave his name to the city of Sebtah  (Ceuta). Ibnu Ghélib? follows the same opinion, but makes Andalus to be the son  of Y4feth. Ibnu Hayyén,? Ibnu Khaldin,* and others, derive it from Andalosh,®  a nation of barbarians who settled there. This latter opinion seems the most  probable ; but God is all-knowing.\n",
      "The country of Andalus (may God restore it entire to the Moslems !) has been Cimate.  described both by native and foreign writers in the most pompous terms. The  Wizir Lisénu-d-din® Ibnu-l-khattib, (may God show him mercy!) in one of his  historical works, says as follows: ‘‘ God Almighty has distinguished this our  “country by endowing it with gentle hills and fertile plains, sweet and wholesome\n",

He has also endowed its inhabitants with great aptitude for  “« the sciences and the arts of domestic life ; acuteness of mind, quickness of intel-  “ lect ; courage, ardent love of every thing which is noble, and many other brilliant  “« qualities, which are not to be found united in people of any other country.”\n",
      "Abt ’Obeyd-illah Al-bekri Al-andalusi? compares his native country to Shém  (Syria) for purity of air and sweetness of waters, to Yemen for mildness of tempera-  ture, which is every where the same, to Hind (India) for drugs and aromatic plants,  to Al-ahwéz® for the magnitude of its snakes, to China for mines and precious  stones, to ’Aden for the number and security of its coasts and harbours.\n",
      "Abi ’A’mir As-salémi,® in his work entitled ‘ Durru-I-kildyid wa ghurruru-l-  fawdyid, (pearls of the necklaces, and stars of useful things,) says that Andalus  belongs to the climate of Sham (Syria) ; that which, of all those into which the  earth is divided, is reckoned the best and most temperate, which has the finest land  and waters, and which abounds most in animals, fruits, and productions of all kinds :  “ that climate,” he adds, ‘‘ occupies a middle place among the other climates, and  ‘is therefore considered the best, it being well known that the most preferable  “« portion of any thing is that which is in the middle.”\n",
      "The Sheikh Ahmed Ibn Mohammed Ibn Misa Ar-rézi!® says that Andalus  is situated at the extremity of the fourth climate towards the West, and that  all learned authors agree in describing it as a country with delightful valleys,  and fertile lands, rich in all sorts of agricultural productions, watered by many  large rivers, and abounding in springs of the sweetest waters. It contains but  few wild beasts, or venomous reptiles ; the air in winter is mild, and the coolest  breezes temper the heat of summer. The climate is so temperate all the year  round as to make the transition from one season to another almost imperceptible ;  in fact, it may be said that a perpetual spring reigns all over Andalus, this  being the reason why most of the fruits of earth grow in all seasons, and the  crops succeed one another without interruption ; owing, too, to the different  qualities of the soil, the same produce may be obtained all the year round in  various provinces of Andalus ; as, for instance, on the coast and the lands adjoining  to it all fruits of the earth are very forward, while in the Thagher™ and its  districts, and especially on the mountains, where the air is colder, they are, on  the contrary, very backward. Most of its fruits, also, partake of a flavour and  beauty which are not common to those of other countries.’?\n",
      "That Andalus is situate in the fourth climate appears sufficiently demonstrated\n",
      "  CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 19\n",
      " by the words of the geographer Idrisi, as quoted by Ibnu Sa’id: ‘‘ Andalus,”  says that author, ‘‘has no portion of its territory within the third climate, but  “the fourth passes by its southern coast, and includes Cordova, Seville, Murcia,  “and Valencia; thence it goes towards Sicily, encloses this and other islands in  “the neighbourhood, leaving the sun at the back. The fifth passes by Toleytoleh  “ Toledo), Sarakostah (Saragossa) and the environs; then by Arghon’* (Aragon),  “at the southern extremity of which is the city of Barshelénah (Barcelona), thence  “it proceeds to Rome and the country subject to that city, divides the Bahru-l-  “ Banddikeh (Gulf of Venice) into two parts, and comprises Costantiniyeh the  “ great (Constantinople) and its territory, leaving behind the planet called  “ Az-zahrah (Venus). The sixth passes by the northern coast of Andalus,  “that which is washed by the waters of the circumambient sea, includes part of  “ Castile* and Portugal,'® a great portion of the country of the Franks, Georgia,  “and the country of the Sclavonians and Russians, leaving behind the planet  “called ’Ottdrid (Mercury). The seventh comprises the circumambient sea to  “the north of Andalus, the island called Alinkilterrah'® (England) and others  “in the neighbourhood, as well as the remainder of the countries of the Franks  “and Sclavonians, Georgia, and Berjén.'\"\"—According to Al-beyhaki'® the island  “ of Tili,’® and the two islands of Al-ajbél? (Norway) and An-nisé”! (Amazones)  “and several other districts of Russia, fall within the limits of this seventh and  “ last climate, which has the moon at its back.”\n",
      "Respecting the name of Al-jeztrah (the island) by which all authors agree in  designating Andalus, it must not be understood by it that that country is, properly  speaking, an island ; since it is well known to be joined to the great land (continent)  by the chain of mountains called Al-bort™ (Pyrenees), but the Arabs in general  all by this name all those countries which are surrounded by water on every side  but one, and this being the case with Andalus, it was called Al-jeztrah. Two  principal seas wash the shores of Andalus; on the northern and western side  the circumambient sea (Ocean), on the southern and eastern the sea of Shdm  (Mediterranean). By the sea of Shém we understand that sea which begins at  the lower extremity of Andalus, at a place on its south-western coast called  Jeziratu-l-khadhrdé® (Algesiras), between Tangiers in Africa and the coast of  Andalus, taking from thence its course towards Syria. The width of this sea  at the said spot is generally stated at eighteen’ miles ; which is also the dis-  tance between Jezirah Tarif* (Tarifa) and Kasr Masmiidah* (Alcasar), near  Ceuta. Between these two last mentioned places there was once a bridge,  which, according to common opinion, Iskhander (Alexander) ordered to be built,\n",
      "  Dimensions of  the country.\n",
      " 20 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Boox 1.\n",
      " that he might pass from Andalus into the opposite land of Africa. But of this  more will be said in the course of this narrative.\n",
      "The narrow sea thus emergmg from between the two coasts was called  Bahru-z-sokdk™ (the narrow sea). Although the distance between the two  shores is so small, as we have already observed, this strait is nevertheless  very difficult to be passed, owing to the continual agitation of its waves, and  the frightful whirlpools occasioned by the meeting of the two seas. We have  said that the width of the straits at the narrowest part was eighteen miles ; it  is double that width at Ceuta, and from thence the sea begins to grow wider  and wider, until at some places it reaches 800 miles in breadth, or perhaps  more ; as happens at Stir (Tyre), on the coast of Syria. This sea contains  many islands, which some geographers estimate to be twenty-eight in number,  and of which the principal are Sicily, Malta, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, Corfu, and  so forth.\n",
      "The dimensions of the country are differently stated: Al-mes’idi,” in his  “« Golden Meadows,” says, ‘‘ Andalus is very thickly peopled ; nearly two months  ‘of continual marching are required to traverse it from one end to the other.  “Tt contains nearly forty cities of the first rank.” Ibn Alisa’ *® agrees with  Al-mes’idi in this particular ; his opinion is that the length of Andalus from  Ariénah ® (Narbonne) to Ishbénah (Lisbon) is equal to the distance that a horse-  man well mounted may travel in sixty days; but this is decidedly an error, first  of all because Narbonne is, by that author, placed within the limits of Andalus,  while it is evident that it belongs to another country; and secondly, because the  distance between those two cities is much overrated, as most of the authors who  have written on the subject estimate it at only one month and a half’s march.\n",
      "Tbnu Sa’id, however, endeavours to adjust the difference by supposing that  Tbn Alisa’ meant a horseman not well mounted, and travelling by short stages,  and that his text was vitiated by the copyist. He himself adopts the computation  of the Sherif Idrisi as that which deserves more credit, namely, that the length  of Andalus is of one month’s march. The same opinion is followed by Al-hijéri,°  who, having, as he informs us, consulted with well informed and trustworthy  travellers on the subject, learnt from them that a little more than a month’s  good travelling was sufficient to traverse Andalus in its whole length.\n",
      "The last mentioned author (Al-hijéri) estimates the distance from Lisbon to  Al-hdjiz*' (the Pyrenees) at more than one thousand miles, but whoever wishes  to obtain more information on the subject may consult Ibnu Sa’id, who has  treated the matter at full length.\n",
      "  cHaP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 21\n",
      " The width of Andalus measured at the top, towards the north-east, is forty  miles, this being the length of those mountain barriers which separate it from  the country of the Franks, and which stretch along from the Mediterranean to  the Ocean ; if measured at the centre, as for instance drawing a line to pass by  Toledo, it is sixteen days’ march.\n",
      "Its shape, according to all accounts, is that of a triangle; much difference, Shape.  however, exists among geographers respecting its north-eastern*? angle, namely,  that which falls in the neighbourhood of Narbonne: some authors, like Ahmed  Ibn Mohammed Ar-rézi and Ibnu Hayyén, placing it in Narbonne, a city imme-  diately facing Bordhil (Bourdeaux)** on the north-east ; while others only place  it in the neighbouring districts. But this, as well as other points concerning  the topography of Andalus, has been decided by the Sherif Idrisi, an author  in whose accounts implicit reliance may be placed, not only because he traversed  that country in all directions, navigated its seas, and surveyed its coasts, but  also on account of the great knowledge he acquired in the science of geography.\n",
      "The words of Ar-r4zi on the subject are as follows: ‘‘ The shape of Andalus  “is that of a triangle, the angles of which are placed, one at Kadis (Cadiz), where  “stands the famous tower with an idol at the top, or rather at that spot on the  “extreme south where the Mediterranean begins, directing its course to the east.  “The other to the east of Andalus, between the cities of Narbonne and Bordhil,  “ which are now in the hands of the Franks, falling diametrically opposite to the  “two islands of Mayércah (Mallorca) and Mendércah (Menorca), and at an equal  “distance from the Ocean and Mediterranean, which in those parts are separated  “only by an intervening tract of land called Al-abwdb (the Gates), being gorges  “or passes which serve as a communication between the island of Andalus and  “the great land (continent) of which Afranjah (France) forms part. At this  “ place the distance between the two seas is of two days’ march, Narbonne being  “on the coast of the Mediterranean, and Bordhil facing the Ocean. The third  “angle is placed in the north-west, in that spot of the country of Jalikiyah  “ (Galicia), where there is a mountain near the sea, and on it a very high tower,  “with an idol on the top, similar to that of Kadis, and looking towards Birtdéniah  “ (Britain).”\n",
      "Tbnu Sa’id says, ‘“ having once asked the opinion of several men learned in  “these matters, I was told that Idrisi’s statement seemed the most worthy of  “being received, namely, that neither Narbonne nor Bordhil were within the  “limits of Andalus, and therefore that the angle in the east must be placed  “between the cities of Barshelénah (Barcelona) and Tarkénah (Tarragona), at  “a spot called Wéddi-Zanlakalto,* close to the mountain barrier which there\n",
      "  Ancient divi-  sions.\n",
      " 22 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book 1.\n",
      " * divides Andalus from the continent, where many different languages are spoken.  ‘“‘ These mountains have several passes or gates, which a Grecian king* ordered  “to be opened in the rock with fire, vinegar, and iron, for before his time there  ‘* was no communication whatsoever by land between Andalus and the continent.  “The said gates or passes face that part of the Bahru-z-zokdk (Mediterranean)  “‘ which divides the two islands of Mallorca and Menorca, this being a fact which  ** is corroborated by the assertions of all travellers in those districts. The second  “and third angles are placed by Idrisi in the same situation that the authors  “before mentioned agree in giving them, viz., in the promontory called ’Ajma’u-  “ [-bahrdnt,® near the city of Shant Yakéh (Santiago) in Galicia, where the  ‘“‘ famous beacon stands; and in the mountain of Al-aghar,*”7 near Cadiz, the  “‘ site of the well-known tower which has an idol on the top of it. Near this  “* mountain, in a south-west direction, is the spot where the Bahru-z-zokdk (narrow  “ sea) emerges from the Ocean, and from whence, after washing the southern and  “* eastern coasts of Andalus, it reaches one side of the Pyrenees.”\n",
      "Andalus was divided, following the words of Ar-rézi, into two parts :—Andalus  Al-gharbé (Western), and Andalus Ash-sharki (Eastern), the division having been  made according to the prevailing winds, the fall of the rains, and the course of  the rivers. The Gharbi (weStern) was that part of Andalus whose rivers empty  their waters into the Western Ocean, and where it rains when the winds blow  from the western quarter ; the Sharkt (eastern), which was also called Al-aksd,  or the remote, being, on the contrary, that whose rivers flow to the east, and  where it rains when the easterly winds blow. The dividing line between these  two districts was placed by Ar-r4zi in the mountains of the Basques (Al-bashkans)  towards the east, from thence drawing a line to the city of Santa Maria,** then  inclining a little towards the district of Agreda, in the neighbourhood of Toledo,  and at last approaching that part of the Mediterranean which washes the shores of  the modern Cartagena, which belongs to the district of Lércah (Lorca). All the  countries falling eastward of this line were therefore comprised within the limits  of Eastern Andalus, and those to the west within those of Western Andalus. The  boundaries of the latter were: to the north-west, and west, the Ocean; to the south  the Western Sea, whence the Mediterranean, which the ancients called also  Bahr Tirren,® issues to take its course towards Syria. Bahr Tirren means the  sea that divides the globe: it was called also the Great Sea.‘\n",
      "Abi Bekr ’Abdullah Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakam, known by the surname of Ibn An-  nadhdhém,\"' treating of the said division, adds a few particulars which we repeat  here for the sake of information. ‘‘ Andalus,” he says, ‘‘ was divided into two  “« parts by ancient geographers, who observed that whenever winds from the west\n",
      "  CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 23\n",
      " “ prevailed, it ‘rained much in Western Andalus, and there was drought in the  “ Eastern; and, on the contrary, when the wind blew from the east, rain fell  “in abundance in the Eastern, and the Western was dry and parched. The  “same difference was observed respecting the course of rivers, for all the rivers  “in Western Andalus flow from the east to the west, forcing their way through  “ those mountains *? that traverse it in the middle, and are only a branch detached  “from the mountains in the north-western districts. In the Eastern all rivers  “flow from west to east, for although some of them take a more southern  “ direction, yet they all spring from the said mountains in the centre of Andalus,  “and discharge their waters into the Mediterranean, which goes on to Syria,  “and is known also by the name of Bahru-r-rimi (the sea of Greece). As to  “the rivers of the north-western districts** (Al-Juf), including those of the  “country of the Galicians, and its dependencies, all empty themselves into the  ‘ preat ocean (Atlantic), which washes the shores of those countries.”\n",
      "The same author (Ibn An-nadhdhém) says that the first people who, after the First setters  deluge, settled in Andalus, according to the accounts of foreign writers, were a ‘*\"\"\"\"*  nation called Andalush, who gave their name to the country. This word Andalush  being in the course of time corrupted by the Arabs, who changed the letter shin  into sin, it was written and pronounced Andalus, which is the present name of  this country.“ Those barbarians came to Andalus and settled in it; and their  numbers having increased considerably, in the course of time they filled the whole  country and established different kingdoms in it. But being idolaters (Majis), |  and otherwise inclined to depravity and corruption, they lived in entire disobedience :  to the divine precepts, until God Almighty, perceiving their obstinacy, withdrew \\  the rain from them, and the whole country was thereby exposed to the most  dreadful sterility ; fountains sank into the bowels of the earth, rivers altered their  course, trees dried up, plants withered, and both men and beasts experienced  the most raging thirst, owing to which most of the inhabitants perished, with the  exception of a few who escaped from death by flying into distant lands. Thus  freed from these people, Andalus became a desert, and continued so for one  hundred years,** for that great calamity was not confined to any part of its territory,  but ravaged the whole country from the Pyrenees to the furthest extremity in the  Western or Green Sea. The reign of ‘the Andalush had lasted one hundred and  odd years.\n",
      "At last, after Andalus had remained in that state for the said period of years, Africans.  God Almighty was pleased to send other settlers; these were certain people  whom the king of Africa had banished his dominions, because of their having  excited sedition in his state, and instigated his subjects to revolt against him.\n",

      " After making war against them until they were nearly exterminated, he caused  the few who remained to be embarked on board some vessels, and giving them  for commander an officer of the name of Batrikus, he allowed them to go whither  they pleased. Batrikus and his men first cast anchor at a place on the western  shore of Andalus, and settled at Cadiz. Having afterwards advanced into the  interior of the country, they found that, owing to the fall of rain, the land had  recovered its former aspect, the fields were adorned with verdure, the rivers flowed,  the fountains ran, and the trees were covered with leaves. Encouraged by what  they saw, they proceeded still farther, spread themselves about the country,  extended their settlements, built cities and towns, and increased their numbers  by marriage. However, they settled in preference in that part of the country  hetween the place of their landing in the west, and the country of the Franks  in the east, and appointed kings to rule over them and administer their affairs.  Their religion was the same as that of their predecessors in the country, that is,  they worshipped idols. They fixed their capital at Talikah (Italica), a city now  in ruins, and which once belonged to the district of Ishbiliah (Seville). But,  after a period of one hundred and fifty-seven years, during which eleven kings  of that race reigned over Andalus, God Almighty permitted that they should all  be annihilated by the barbarians of Rome, who invaded and conquered the country.  “ After the defeat and destruction of the Africans, the empire of Andalus  “ devolved to the people of Rome and their king Ishbén, son of Titus, after  ‘‘whom Andalus was called Ishbdniah. Some authors assert that the real name  “of this king was Isbahdén, and that he was called so on account of his being  “born in the city of Isfahén; only that the barbarians corrupted it and called  “him Ishban ; but, be this as it may, certain it is that this king Ishbin founded  “ Seville, and called it after his name Ishbaniah, which in after time became also  ‘the appellation of the whole country, owing to the numerous ruins of works  “‘ and edifices erected by him, which are still visible in many parts of Andalus.  “This king Ishbén is generally held as one of the conquerors of the earth. He  “‘ invaded Andalus, and by the favour of God, who gave victory to his arms, he  “made war against the inhabitants, dispersed their armies, slaughtered and cap-  “tured their men, and besieged them at last in their capital, the city of Italica.  “* The Africans made a most desperate resistance, and, the place being very strong,  ‘held out a considerable time, until Ishban, impatient of the delay, caused the  “city of Seville to be built opposite to Italica, and, pressing on the siege, took it  “by storm. By the taking of Italica, which he ordered to be demolished, and  “its marbles and effects carried to his new city, the whole of Andalus submitted  “to Ishban, who, having completed the building of Seville, chose it for his court\n",
      "  CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 25\n",
      " “and residence, established his authority permanently, increased his armies, and  “pursued his career of conquest. Scarcely two years had elapsed when he  “sailed from Seville with a fleet, attacked Ilia‘” which is the same as Al-Kods  (Jerusalem) the illustrious, plundered and de. ~lished it, killed one hundred  “thousand Jews, spared one hundred thousand, an. <aused its marbles and  “effects to be transported to Andalus. This Ishb4n further subdued all his  “enemies, and his reign was very prosperous.” The preceding account is taken,  word for word, from Ibn An-nadhdh4m. We may add to it what a certain historian  says to prove the taking of Jerusalem, although he attributes the conquest to  another king, namely, that most of the wonderful things which the Moslems  found among the spoils of Andalus at the time of the conquest, such as the  table of Suleymén, son of Datid, (upon whom be peace!) which Térik Ibn  Zeyad found in a temple at Toledo, and the pearl necklace taken by Misa Ibn  Nosseyr from the church at Merida, as well as a great many other precious objects  and jewels, of which a more ample description will be given hereafter, were part  of the share in the spoil which, at the taking of Jerusalem by Bokht Nasser,  fell to the lot of a king of Spain, whose name was Beridn,** and who was present  at the conquest of that city. The whole of these precious objects had been in  former times the property of the Prophet Suleyman, son of. Daiid, for whose use  the Jinn had constructed them. How the contradictory accounts of these two  historians are to be adjusted we cannot decide, unless Ishbén and Beridn be the  same person: God only is all-knowing.\n",
      "To return to Ishb4n. Ibnu Hayyén, in his historical work entitled “ the book tshbén.  “of the seeker of information respecting the History of the Barbarians,”“? says  that this Ishban was once a very poor man from the lower ranks of society, and  as he was one day engaged in ploughing a field with his oxen, Al-khadher ® (on  whom be peace !) appeared before him, and addressed him thus: “‘ O Ishban, thou  “ art destined to perform great deeds; thou shalt reign, and thy fame shall spread  “far and wide. When thou takest Ilia, be kind to the descendants of the  “ Prophet.”” And Ishb4n answered, ‘“ Thou art jesting, no doubt, or I am not  ‘“‘ the person thou meanest, for I am a poor and weak man, and am obliged to  “hire out my services to gain a living, and certainly it is not for people of my  “class that the empire is reserved.” “‘ No matter,” replied Al-khadher, ‘“ what  “‘T tell thee is the plain truth; it is predestined, and it shall happen: He has  “decreed it who has the power to change that dry rod thou bearest in thy  “hand into a green bough.” Ishban looked, when lo! it suddenly turned  green, flourished, and was covered with leaves. Ishb4n was astounded when he  saw the miracle ; he tried to speak, but his tongue clove to his mouth; he looked\n",

      " for Al-khadher, but Al-khadher was gone, he had vanished from his sight. How-  ever, the words of the Prophet remaining deeply impressed on his mind, he began  to turn over what had been said to him, and the result was that he soon after-  wards left his master’s service, and associated with men of courage and deter-  mination, amongst whom he became conspicuous for his prowess, until he arrived  at power and performed what has been related. His reign lasted twenty years,  and he transmitted the empire to his posterity, of whom fifty-five kings ruled  over Andalus.\n",
      "After this the country was invaded by other barbarians coming from Rome,  and called Bishtilikat,** who, with their king Talubush,*? son of Beytah, at their  head, arrived in Andalus, after conquering on their way the country of the  Franks, which they governed by their prefects. This took place about the  time of the resurrection of the Massih (anointed), son of Mariim, (on whom be  peace!) They conquered the whole of Andalus, and fixed their court at Merida,  remaining in undisturbed possession of the country during the reign of twenty-  seven monarchs, until they themselves were subdued by the Goths, who with  their king at their head invaded Andalus, and separated it for ever from the  empire of Rome.\n",
      "The Goths fixed their capital at Tolétalah (Toledo). However, Ishbiliah still  continued to be the abode of the sciences, and the dwelling-place of the most  noble among the Ishbdnians. About this time the Apostles sent by \"Isa Al-massih  (the anointed) began to wander about the world, calling the people to his  religion. In some countries their words were heard, and thousands of people  embraced the religion which they preached ; in others they were unheard, and  put to death. Among those who adopted their creed, and honoured the Apostles,  was Khoshandinus* (Constantine), king of the Goths, who not only embraced  Christianity, but called upon his subjects to do the same. This Khoshandinus is held  by the Christians as the greatest king they ever had, and as the most accomplished,  upright, virtuous, and wise monarch that can be imagined. It was he who  introduced Christianity into his dominions, where it has flourished ever since,  and used to decide in all law cases with the assistance of the Gospels, those books  upon which various opinions prevail, as also upon their writers or compilers.  Several kings of the posterity of Khoshandinus reigned after him in Andalus,  until that country was finally subdued by the Arabs, by whose means God  Almighty was pleased to make manifest the superiority of Islam over every  other religion.’\n",
      "The number of kings of Gothic descent who reigned over Andalus ‘is stated  in the old Christian chronicles to have been thirty-six, from Atdnduinus,“ who\n",
      "  CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 27\n",
      " reigned in the fifth year of the Emperor Filibus,* in 407 of the era of Safar,**  from which the barbarians compute their years, to Ludherik, their last king,  who reigned in 749% of the said era; and in whose time the Arabs conquered  Andalus and overthrew the Gothic empire: their domination, moreover, is said  to have lasted 342 years.\n",
      "However, there are not wanting authors who make of the Goths and the  Bishtilikaét only one nation, but the generality think, as we have said, that they  were distinct people, that the latter were the barbarians of Rome, that they fixed  their court at Merida, and that the kings of their race were twenty-seven in  number ; that the Goths came afterwards, subdued the country, and made the  city of Toledo the seat of their empire. All agree, however, in stating the number  of their kings to be thirty-six. The Goths, according to Ar-r4zi, are the sons  of Yajuj, son of Y4feth, son of Nuh; others give them a different origin.\n",
      "Before leaving the subject of the ancient history of Andalus, we deem it proper  to transcribe here the words of the K4di-l-kod4 Ibnu Khaldin Al-hadhrami,**  in his great historical work. ‘‘ The opposite land,” he says, ‘‘ which the barbarians  “call Andalush, is inhabited by various nations of western Franks, among which  “the most powerful and numerous are the Jalalcah (Galicians). Hundreds of  “vears before the manifestation of Islam, the Goths, after fighting many battles  “with the Latins, laid siege to their capital, the city of Rome ; after this, peace  ‘was made between them, one of the conditions being that the Goths should  “go to Andalus ; and they accordingly went to that country and took possession  “of it. When the Greeks and Latins embraced Christianity, they induced the  “nations of Franks and Goths who dwelt beyond them in the west to do the  “same, and they accordingly became Christians. The Goths, who had possession  “of Andalus, established their capital in Toledo ; but it was not always so, for in  “ the course of time their kings resided by turns in Seville, Cordova, or Merida,  “besides the above-mentioned city. Their dominion lasted for nearly 400 years,  “until God Almighty was pleased to spread Isl4m and conquest over their  “country. Their king at that time was named Ludherik, an appellation generally  “given by the Goths to their kings, as the Romans call their emperor Kaysar  “ (Cesar), and the Sicilians name their king Jerjiz.” ©\n",
      "If we are to believe the ancient traditions, Iskhander (Alexander) must also have Iskhander  \"resided. in Andalus ; the remains, too, of a bridge erected by him, between Tangiers fodalue.  and Algesiras, are reported by Idrisi as still existing in his time. The building  of the bridge originated thus: It is generally asserted that, in times of old, the  Mediterranean was a lake surrounded by land on every side, like the sea of\n",
      "  28 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.\n",
      " Tabaristén (the Caspian sea), whose waters have no communication whatsoever  with those of other seas, and that Andalus and the opposite land of Africa were  joined together so as to form only one continent, owing to which the people  of the remote West (Maghrebu-l-aksa) were continually making incursions into  Andalus, and visiting its inhabitants with destruction and war. On the arrival  of Iskhander in Andalus, the people appeared before him, and humbly besought  him that he would put a stop to the hostile incursions of their neighbours, upon  which Iskhander, having taken the subject into consideration, called together  his architects and geometricians, and bid them appear in his presence on the  spot now occupied by Bahru-z-zok4k (Straits of Gibraltar). He then commanded  them to measure the level of the two seas (the Ocean and Mediterranean), which  being done, the first (the Ocean) was found to be a little the higher. This being  reported to Iskhander, he issued immediate orders for the demolition of all the  cities which stood on the coast of the Mediterranean, enjoining at the same time  that they should be rebuilt farther into the country on more elevated situations.  He next caused a deep trench or canal to be dug between Tangiers and Andalus,  and the digging was carried so deep into the earth that the crests of the mountains  of the lower world became visible.’ When the excavation was completed, a  wharf,” of great dimensions, and built with stone and mortar, an admirable work  of art, was erected all along the coast of Andalus, measuring in length twelve  miles, the distance which then separated the two seas. Another wharf of similar  dimensions was constructed along the coast.of Tangiers, and the space left between  the two was six miles, which is exactly the width of the straits at that spot. This  being done, he caused another great excavation to be made on the side of the  Ocean, and, when every thing was ready, the waters of the great sea (Ocean) were  let into the excavated space between the two wharfs, but with such a fury did they  rush into the Mediterranean that its bed was filled, the neighbouring countries  were inundated, many cities were submerged, and thousands of people perished in  the waves. The waters covered both the wharfs, and rose to a height of eleven  ells. The wharf nearest to Andalus is sometimes visible at low water, when it  looks like a great parallel line; the inhabitants of the two islands® call it Al-  kantarah (the bridge). As to the African one, it is no where visible, having been  completely swallowed up by the waves, which inundated on both sides a piece  of ground measuring twelve miles, and were only checked in their progress by  the mountains on either side. The ports in this strait are, on the side of Africa,  Kasru-l-majéz (Alcasar), Tangiers, and Ceuta; on the side of Andalus, Jebel Tarik  (Gibraltar), Jezirah Tarif (Tarifa), Jeziratu-l-khadhré (Algesiras), and others.\n",

      " Between the last-mentioned port and Ceuta is the widest part of the strait. The  preceding has been abridged from Idrisi, who treats the subject at full length.\n",
      "We shall now pass to the description of some of the principal cities of Andalus ;  but before engaging in this we deem it necessary to state, that, owing to the plan we  have adopted in writing this work, it may happen that in transcribing or extracting  the accounts of different historians some facts are repeated, and others entirely  contradicted ; but let our excuse be that we have been obliged to connect, one with  another, the narratives of writers of all countries and ages.\n"

       " 'Abt ’Obeyd-illah Al-bekri Al-andalusi? compares his native country to Shém  (Syria) for purity of air and sweetness of waters, to Yemen for mildness of tempera-  ture, which is every where the same, to Hind (India) for drugs and aromatic plants,  to Al-ahwéz® for the magnitude of its snakes, to China for mines and precious  stones, to ’Aden for the number and security of its coasts and harbours.',\n",
       " 'Abi ’A’mir As-salémi,® in his work entitled ‘ Durru-I-kildyid wa ghurruru-l-  fawdyid, (pearls of the necklaces, and stars of useful things,) says that Andalus  belongs to the climate of Sham (Syria) ; that which, of all those into which the  earth is divided, is reckoned the best and most temperate, which has the finest land  and waters, and which abounds most in animals, fruits, and productions of all kinds :  “ that climate,” he adds, ‘‘ occupies a middle place among the other climates, and  ‘is therefore considered the best, it being well known that the most preferable  “« portion of any thing is that which is in the middle.”',\n",
       " 'The Sheikh Ahmed Ibn Mohammed Ibn Misa Ar-rézi!® says that Andalus  is situated at the extremity of the fourth climate towards the West, and that  all learned authors agree in describing it as a country with delightful valleys,  and fertile lands, rich in all sorts of agricultural productions, watered by many  large rivers, and abounding in springs of the sweetest waters. It contains but  few wild beasts, or venomous reptiles ; the air in winter is mild, and the coolest  breezes temper the heat of summer. The climate is so temperate all the year  round as to make the transition from one season to another almost imperceptible ;  in fact, it may be said that a perpetual spring reigns all over Andalus, this  being the reason why most of the fruits of earth grow in all seasons, and the  crops succeed one another without interruption ; owing, too, to the different  qualities of the soil, the same produce may be obtained all the year round in  various provinces of Andalus ; as, for instance, on the coast and the lands adjoining  to it all fruits of the earth are very forward, while in the Thagher™ and its  districts, and especially on the mountains, where the air is colder, they are, on  the contrary, very backward. Most of its fruits, also, partake of a flavour and  beauty which are not common to those of other countries.’?',\n",

The fifth passes by Toleytoleh  “ Toledo), Sarakostah (Saragossa) and the environs; then by Arghon’* (Aragon),  “at the southern extremity of which is the city of Barshelénah (Barcelona), thence  “it proceeds to Rome and the country subject to that city, divides the Bahru-l-  “ Banddikeh (Gulf of Venice) into two parts, and comprises Costantiniyeh the  “ great (Constantinople) and its territory, leaving behind the planet called  “ Az-zahrah (Venus). The sixth passes by the northern coast of Andalus,  “that which is washed by the waters of the circumambient sea, includes part of  “ Castile* and Portugal,\\'® a great portion of the country of the Franks, Georgia,  “and the country of the Sclavonians and Russians, leaving behind the planet  “called ’Ottdrid (Mercury). The seventh comprises the circumambient sea to  “the north of Andalus, the island called Alinkilterrah\\'® (England) and others  “in the neighbourhood, as well as the remainder of the countries of the Franks  “and Sclavonians, Georgia, and Berjén.\\'\"\"—According to Al-beyhaki\\'® the island  “ of Tili,’® and the two islands of Al-ajbél? (Norway) and An-nisé”! (Amazones)  “and several other districts of Russia, fall within the limits of this seventh and  “ last climate, which has the moon at its back.”',\n",
       " 'Respecting the name of Al-jeztrah (the island) by which all authors agree in  designating Andalus, it must not be understood by it that that country is, properly  speaking, an island ; since it is well known to be joined to the great land (continent)  by the chain of mountains called Al-bort™ (Pyrenees), but the Arabs in general  all by this name all those countries which are surrounded by water on every side  but one, and this being the case with Andalus, it was called Al-jeztrah. Two  principal seas wash the shores of Andalus; on the northern and western side  the circumambient sea (Ocean), on the southern and eastern the sea of Shdm  (Mediterranean). By the sea of Shém we understand that sea which begins at  the lower extremity of Andalus, at a place on its south-western coast called  Jeziratu-l-khadhrdé® (Algesiras), between Tangiers in Africa and the coast of  Andalus, taking from thence its course towards Syria. The width of this sea  at the said spot is generally stated at eighteen’ miles ; which is also the dis-  tance between Jezirah Tarif* (Tarifa) and Kasr Masmiidah* (Alcasar), near  Ceuta. Between these two last mentioned places there was once a bridge,  which, according to common opinion, Iskhander (Alexander) ordered to be built,',\n",

       " ' that he might pass from Andalus into the opposite land of Africa. But of this  more will be said in the course of this narrative.',\n",
       " 'The narrow sea thus emergmg from between the two coasts was called  Bahru-z-sokdk™ (the narrow sea). Although the distance between the two  shores is so small, as we have already observed, this strait is nevertheless  very difficult to be passed, owing to the continual agitation of its waves, and  the frightful whirlpools occasioned by the meeting of the two seas. We have  said that the width of the straits at the narrowest part was eighteen miles ; it  is double that width at Ceuta, and from thence the sea begins to grow wider  and wider, until at some places it reaches 800 miles in breadth, or perhaps  more ; as happens at Stir (Tyre), on the coast of Syria. This sea contains  many islands, which some geographers estimate to be twenty-eight in number,  and of which the principal are Sicily, Malta, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, Corfu, and  so forth.',\n",
       " 'The dimensions of the country are differently stated: Al-mes’idi,” in his  “« Golden Meadows,” says, ‘‘ Andalus is very thickly peopled ; nearly two months  ‘of continual marching are required to traverse it from one end to the other.  “Tt contains nearly forty cities of the first rank.” Ibn Alisa’ *® agrees with  Al-mes’idi in this particular ; his opinion is that the length of Andalus from  Ariénah ® (Narbonne) to Ishbénah (Lisbon) is equal to the distance that a horse-  man well mounted may travel in sixty days; but this is decidedly an error, first  of all because Narbonne is, by that author, placed within the limits of Andalus,  while it is evident that it belongs to another country; and secondly, because the  distance between those two cities is much overrated, as most of the authors who  have written on the subject estimate it at only one month and a half’s march.',\n",
       " 'Tbnu Sa’id, however, endeavours to adjust the difference by supposing that  Tbn Alisa’ meant a horseman not well mounted, and travelling by short stages,  and that his text was vitiated by the copyist. He himself adopts the computation  of the Sherif Idrisi as that which deserves more credit, namely, that the length  of Andalus is of one month’s march. The same opinion is followed by Al-hijéri,°  who, having, as he informs us, consulted with well informed and trustworthy  travellers on the subject, learnt from them that a little more than a month’s  good travelling was sufficient to traverse Andalus in its whole length.',\n",
       " \"The last mentioned author (Al-hijéri) estimates the distance from Lisbon to  Al-hdjiz*' (the Pyrenees) at more than one thousand miles, but whoever wishes  to obtain more information on the subject may consult Ibnu Sa’id, who has  treated the matter at full length.\",\n",

       " ' The width of Andalus measured at the top, towards the north-east, is forty  miles, this being the length of those mountain barriers which separate it from  the country of the Franks, and which stretch along from the Mediterranean to  the Ocean ; if measured at the centre, as for instance drawing a line to pass by  Toledo, it is sixteen days’ march.',\n",
       " 'Its shape, according to all accounts, is that of a triangle; much difference, Shape.  however, exists among geographers respecting its north-eastern*? angle, namely,  that which falls in the neighbourhood of Narbonne: some authors, like Ahmed  Ibn Mohammed Ar-rézi and Ibnu Hayyén, placing it in Narbonne, a city imme-  diately facing Bordhil (Bourdeaux)** on the north-east ; while others only place  it in the neighbouring districts. But this, as well as other points concerning  the topography of Andalus, has been decided by the Sherif Idrisi, an author  in whose accounts implicit reliance may be placed, not only because he traversed  that country in all directions, navigated its seas, and surveyed its coasts, but  also on account of the great knowledge he acquired in the science of geography.',\n",
       " 'The words of Ar-r4zi on the subject are as follows: ‘‘ The shape of Andalus  “is that of a triangle, the angles of which are placed, one at Kadis (Cadiz), where  “stands the famous tower with an idol at the top, or rather at that spot on the  “extreme south where the Mediterranean begins, directing its course to the east.  “The other to the east of Andalus, between the cities of Narbonne and Bordhil,  “ which are now in the hands of the Franks, falling diametrically opposite to the  “two islands of Mayércah (Mallorca) and Mendércah (Menorca), and at an equal  “distance from the Ocean and Mediterranean, which in those parts are separated  “only by an intervening tract of land called Al-abwdb (the Gates), being gorges  “or passes which serve as a communication between the island of Andalus and  “the great land (continent) of which Afranjah (France) forms part. At this  “ place the distance between the two seas is of two days’ march, Narbonne being  “on the coast of the Mediterranean, and Bordhil facing the Ocean. The third  “angle is placed in the north-west, in that spot of the country of Jalikiyah  “ (Galicia), where there is a mountain near the sea, and on it a very high tower,  “with an idol on the top, similar to that of Kadis, and looking towards Birtdéniah  “ (Britain).”',\n",
       " 'Tbnu Sa’id says, ‘“ having once asked the opinion of several men learned in  “these matters, I was told that Idrisi’s statement seemed the most worthy of  “being received, namely, that neither Narbonne nor Bordhil were within the  “limits of Andalus, and therefore that the angle in the east must be placed  “between the cities of Barshelénah (Barcelona) and Tarkénah (Tarragona), at  “a spot called Wéddi-Zanlakalto,* close to the mountain barrier which there',\n",

       " ' * divides Andalus from the continent, where many different languages are spoken.  ‘“‘ These mountains have several passes or gates, which a Grecian king* ordered  “to be opened in the rock with fire, vinegar, and iron, for before his time there  ‘* was no communication whatsoever by land between Andalus and the continent.  “The said gates or passes face that part of the Bahru-z-zokdk (Mediterranean)  “‘ which divides the two islands of Mallorca and Menorca, this being a fact which  ** is corroborated by the assertions of all travellers in those districts. The second  “and third angles are placed by Idrisi in the same situation that the authors  “before mentioned agree in giving them, viz., in the promontory called ’Ajma’u-  “ [-bahrdnt,® near the city of Shant Yakéh (Santiago) in Galicia, where the  ‘“‘ famous beacon stands; and in the mountain of Al-aghar,*”7 near Cadiz, the  “‘ site of the well-known tower which has an idol on the top of it. Near this  “* mountain, in a south-west direction, is the spot where the Bahru-z-zokdk (narrow  “ sea) emerges from the Ocean, and from whence, after washing the southern and  “* eastern coasts of Andalus, it reaches one side of the Pyrenees.”',\n",
       " 'Andalus was divided, following the words of Ar-rézi, into two parts :—Andalus  Al-gharbé (Western), and Andalus Ash-sharki (Eastern), the division having been  made according to the prevailing winds, the fall of the rains, and the course of  the rivers. The Gharbi (weStern) was that part of Andalus whose rivers empty  their waters into the Western Ocean, and where it rains when the winds blow  from the western quarter ; the Sharkt (eastern), which was also called Al-aksd,  or the remote, being, on the contrary, that whose rivers flow to the east, and  where it rains when the easterly winds blow. The dividing line between these  two districts was placed by Ar-r4zi in the mountains of the Basques (Al-bashkans)  towards the east, from thence drawing a line to the city of Santa Maria,** then  inclining a little towards the district of Agreda, in the neighbourhood of Toledo,  and at last approaching that part of the Mediterranean which washes the shores of  the modern Cartagena, which belongs to the district of Lércah (Lorca). All the  countries falling eastward of this line were therefore comprised within the limits  of Eastern Andalus, and those to the west within those of Western Andalus. The  boundaries of the latter were: to the north-west, and west, the Ocean; to the south  the Western Sea, whence the Mediterranean, which the ancients called also  Bahr Tirren,® issues to take its course towards Syria. Bahr Tirren means the  sea that divides the globe: it was called also the Great Sea.‘',\n",
       " 'Abi Bekr ’Abdullah Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakam, known by the surname of Ibn An-  nadhdhém,\"\\' treating of the said division, adds a few particulars which we repeat  here for the sake of information. ‘‘ Andalus,” he says, ‘‘ was divided into two  “« parts by ancient geographers, who observed that whenever winds from the west',\n",
       " '  CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 23',\n",
       " ' “ prevailed, it ‘rained much in Western Andalus, and there was drought in the  “ Eastern; and, on the contrary, when the wind blew from the east, rain fell  “in abundance in the Eastern, and the Western was dry and parched. The  “same difference was observed respecting the course of rivers, for all the rivers  “in Western Andalus flow from the east to the west, forcing their way through  “ those mountains *? that traverse it in the middle, and are only a branch detached  “from the mountains in the north-western districts. In the Eastern all rivers  “flow from west to east, for although some of them take a more southern  “ direction, yet they all spring from the said mountains in the centre of Andalus,  “and discharge their waters into the Mediterranean, which goes on to Syria,  “and is known also by the name of Bahru-r-rimi (the sea of Greece). As to  “the rivers of the north-western districts** (Al-Juf), including those of the  “country of the Galicians, and its dependencies, all empty themselves into the  ‘ preat ocean (Atlantic), which washes the shores of those countries.”',\n",
       " 'The same author (Ibn An-nadhdhém) says that the first people who, after the First setters  deluge, settled in Andalus, according to the accounts of foreign writers, were a ‘*\"\"\"\"*  nation called Andalush, who gave their name to the country. This word Andalush  being in the course of time corrupted by the Arabs, who changed the letter shin  into sin, it was written and pronounced Andalus, which is the present name of  this country.“ Those barbarians came to Andalus and settled in it; and their  numbers having increased considerably, in the course of time they filled the whole  country and established different kingdoms in it. But being idolaters (Majis), |  and otherwise inclined to depravity and corruption, they lived in entire disobedience :  to the divine precepts, until God Almighty, perceiving their obstinacy, withdrew \\\\  the rain from them, and the whole country was thereby exposed to the most  dreadful sterility ; fountains sank into the bowels of the earth, rivers altered their  course, trees dried up, plants withered, and both men and beasts experienced  the most raging thirst, owing to which most of the inhabitants perished, with the  exception of a few who escaped from death by flying into distant lands. Thus  freed from these people, Andalus became a desert, and continued so for one  hundred years,** for that great calamity was not confined to any part of its territory,  but ravaged the whole country from the Pyrenees to the furthest extremity in the  Western or Green Sea. The reign of ‘the Andalush had lasted one hundred and  odd years.',\n",
       " 'At last, after Andalus had remained in that state for the said period of years, Africans.  God Almighty was pleased to send other settlers; these were certain people  whom the king of Africa had banished his dominions, because of their having  excited sedition in his state, and instigated his subjects to revolt against him.',\n",

       " ' After making war against them until they were nearly exterminated, he caused  the few who remained to be embarked on board some vessels, and giving them  for commander an officer of the name of Batrikus, he allowed them to go whither  they pleased. Batrikus and his men first cast anchor at a place on the western  shore of Andalus, and settled at Cadiz. Having afterwards advanced into the  interior of the country, they found that, owing to the fall of rain, the land had  recovered its former aspect, the fields were adorned with verdure, the rivers flowed,  the fountains ran, and the trees were covered with leaves. Encouraged by what  they saw, they proceeded still farther, spread themselves about the country,  extended their settlements, built cities and towns, and increased their numbers  by marriage. However, they settled in preference in that part of the country  hetween the place of their landing in the west, and the country of the Franks  in the east, and appointed kings to rule over them and administer their affairs.  Their religion was the same as that of their predecessors in the country, that is,  they worshipped idols. They fixed their capital at Talikah (Italica), a city now  in ruins, and which once belonged to the district of Ishbiliah (Seville). But,  after a period of one hundred and fifty-seven years, during which eleven kings  of that race reigned over Andalus, God Almighty permitted that they should all  be annihilated by the barbarians of Rome, who invaded and conquered the country.  “ After the defeat and destruction of the Africans, the empire of Andalus  “ devolved to the people of Rome and their king Ishbén, son of Titus, after  ‘‘whom Andalus was called Ishbdniah. Some authors assert that the real name  “of this king was Isbahdén, and that he was called so on account of his being  “born in the city of Isfahén; only that the barbarians corrupted it and called  “him Ishban ; but, be this as it may, certain it is that this king Ishbin founded  “ Seville, and called it after his name Ishbaniah, which in after time became also  ‘the appellation of the whole country, owing to the numerous ruins of works  “‘ and edifices erected by him, which are still visible in many parts of Andalus.  “This king Ishbén is generally held as one of the conquerors of the earth. He  “‘ invaded Andalus, and by the favour of God, who gave victory to his arms, he  “made war against the inhabitants, dispersed their armies, slaughtered and cap-  “tured their men, and besieged them at last in their capital, the city of Italica.  “* The Africans made a most desperate resistance, and, the place being very strong,  ‘held out a considerable time, until Ishban, impatient of the delay, caused the  “city of Seville to be built opposite to Italica, and, pressing on the siege, took it  “by storm. By the taking of Italica, which he ordered to be demolished, and  “its marbles and effects carried to his new city, the whole of Andalus submitted  “to Ishban, who, having completed the building of Seville, chose it for his court',\n",

Scarcely two years had elapsed when he  “sailed from Seville with a fleet, attacked Ilia‘” which is the same as Al-Kods  (Jerusalem) the illustrious, plundered and de. ~lished it, killed one hundred  “thousand Jews, spared one hundred thousand, an. <aused its marbles and  “effects to be transported to Andalus. This Ishb4n further subdued all his  “enemies, and his reign was very prosperous.” The preceding account is taken,  word for word, from Ibn An-nadhdh4m. We may add to it what a certain historian  says to prove the taking of Jerusalem, although he attributes the conquest to  another king, namely, that most of the wonderful things which the Moslems  found among the spoils of Andalus at the time of the conquest, such as the  table of Suleymén, son of Datid, (upon whom be peace!) which Térik Ibn  Zeyad found in a temple at Toledo, and the pearl necklace taken by Misa Ibn  Nosseyr from the church at Merida, as well as a great many other precious objects  and jewels, of which a more ample description will be given hereafter, were part  of the share in the spoil which, at the taking of Jerusalem by Bokht Nasser,  fell to the lot of a king of Spain, whose name was Beridn,** and who was present  at the conquest of that city. The whole of these precious objects had been in  former times the property of the Prophet Suleyman, son of. Daiid, for whose use  the Jinn had constructed them. How the contradictory accounts of these two  historians are to be adjusted we cannot decide, unless Ishbén and Beridn be the  same person: God only is all-knowing.',\n",

How-  ever, the words of the Prophet remaining deeply impressed on his mind, he began  to turn over what had been said to him, and the result was that he soon after-  wards left his master’s service, and associated with men of courage and deter-  mination, amongst whom he became conspicuous for his prowess, until he arrived  at power and performed what has been related. His reign lasted twenty years,  and he transmitted the empire to his posterity, of whom fifty-five kings ruled  over Andalus.',\n",
       " 'After this the country was invaded by other barbarians coming from Rome,  and called Bishtilikat,** who, with their king Talubush,*? son of Beytah, at their  head, arrived in Andalus, after conquering on their way the country of the  Franks, which they governed by their prefects. This took place about the  time of the resurrection of the Massih (anointed), son of Mariim, (on whom be  peace!) They conquered the whole of Andalus, and fixed their court at Merida,  remaining in undisturbed possession of the country during the reign of twenty-  seven monarchs, until they themselves were subdued by the Goths, who with  their king at their head invaded Andalus, and separated it for ever from the  empire of Rome.',\n",
       " 'The Goths fixed their capital at Tolétalah (Toledo). However, Ishbiliah still  continued to be the abode of the sciences, and the dwelling-place of the most  noble among the Ishbdnians. About this time the Apostles sent by \"Isa Al-massih  (the anointed) began to wander about the world, calling the people to his  religion. In some countries their words were heard, and thousands of people  embraced the religion which they preached ; in others they were unheard, and  put to death. Among those who adopted their creed, and honoured the Apostles,  was Khoshandinus* (Constantine), king of the Goths, who not only embraced  Christianity, but called upon his subjects to do the same. This Khoshandinus is held  by the Christians as the greatest king they ever had, and as the most accomplished,  upright, virtuous, and wise monarch that can be imagined. It was he who  introduced Christianity into his dominions, where it has flourished ever since,  and used to decide in all law cases with the assistance of the Gospels, those books  upon which various opinions prevail, as also upon their writers or compilers.  Several kings of the posterity of Khoshandinus reigned after him in Andalus,  until that country was finally subdued by the Arabs, by whose means God  Almighty was pleased to make manifest the superiority of Islam over every  other religion.’',\n",

       " 'However, there are not wanting authors who make of the Goths and the  Bishtilikaét only one nation, but the generality think, as we have said, that they  were distinct people, that the latter were the barbarians of Rome, that they fixed  their court at Merida, and that the kings of their race were twenty-seven in  number ; that the Goths came afterwards, subdued the country, and made the  city of Toledo the seat of their empire. All agree, however, in stating the number  of their kings to be thirty-six. The Goths, according to Ar-r4zi, are the sons  of Yajuj, son of Y4feth, son of Nuh; others give them a different origin.',\n",
       " 'Before leaving the subject of the ancient history of Andalus, we deem it proper  to transcribe here the words of the K4di-l-kod4 Ibnu Khaldin Al-hadhrami,**  in his great historical work. ‘‘ The opposite land,” he says, ‘‘ which the barbarians  “call Andalush, is inhabited by various nations of western Franks, among which  “the most powerful and numerous are the Jalalcah (Galicians). Hundreds of  “vears before the manifestation of Islam, the Goths, after fighting many battles  “with the Latins, laid siege to their capital, the city of Rome ; after this, peace  ‘was made between them, one of the conditions being that the Goths should  “go to Andalus ; and they accordingly went to that country and took possession  “of it. When the Greeks and Latins embraced Christianity, they induced the  “nations of Franks and Goths who dwelt beyond them in the west to do the  “same, and they accordingly became Christians. The Goths, who had possession  “of Andalus, established their capital in Toledo ; but it was not always so, for in  “ the course of time their kings resided by turns in Seville, Cordova, or Merida,  “besides the above-mentioned city. Their dominion lasted for nearly 400 years,  “until God Almighty was pleased to spread Isl4m and conquest over their  “country. Their king at that time was named Ludherik, an appellation generally  “given by the Goths to their kings, as the Romans call their emperor Kaysar  “ (Cesar), and the Sicilians name their king Jerjiz.” ©',\n",

On the arrival  of Iskhander in Andalus, the people appeared before him, and humbly besought  him that he would put a stop to the hostile incursions of their neighbours, upon  which Iskhander, having taken the subject into consideration, called together  his architects and geometricians, and bid them appear in his presence on the  spot now occupied by Bahru-z-zok4k (Straits of Gibraltar). He then commanded  them to measure the level of the two seas (the Ocean and Mediterranean), which  being done, the first (the Ocean) was found to be a little the higher. This being  reported to Iskhander, he issued immediate orders for the demolition of all the  cities which stood on the coast of the Mediterranean, enjoining at the same time  that they should be rebuilt farther into the country on more elevated situations.  He next caused a deep trench or canal to be dug between Tangiers and Andalus,  and the digging was carried so deep into the earth that the crests of the mountains  of the lower world became visible.’ When the excavation was completed, a  wharf,” of great dimensions, and built with stone and mortar, an admirable work  of art, was erected all along the coast of Andalus, measuring in length twelve  miles, the distance which then separated the two seas. Another wharf of similar  dimensions was constructed along the coast.of Tangiers, and the space left between  the two was six miles, which is exactly the width of the straits at that spot. This  being done, he caused another great excavation to be made on the side of the  Ocean, and, when every thing was ready, the waters of the great sea (Ocean) were  let into the excavated space between the two wharfs, but with such a fury did they  rush into the Mediterranean that its bed was filled, the neighbouring countries  were inundated, many cities were submerged, and thousands of people perished in  the waves. The waters covered both the wharfs, and rose to a height of eleven  ells. The wharf nearest to Andalus is sometimes visible at low water, when it  looks like a great parallel line; the inhabitants of the two islands® call it Al-  kantarah (the bridge). As to the African one, it is no where visible, having been  completely swallowed up by the waves, which inundated on both sides a piece  of ground measuring twelve miles, and were only checked in their progress by  the mountains on either side. The ports in this strait are, on the side of Africa,  Kasru-l-majéz (Alcasar), Tangiers, and Ceuta; on the side of Andalus, Jebel Tarik  (Gibraltar), Jezirah Tarif (Tarifa), Jeziratu-l-khadhré (Algesiras), and others.',\n",
