Havine in the preceding Book given a short account of the conquest of Andalus by  the Moslems, we propose saying a few words in the present about those illustrious  Moslems who came in the suite of Musa Ibn Nosseyr, and by whose undaunted  valour and fervent piety that mighty deed was achieved. And first we shall speak  about the as’hdb' (companions) and ¢dbi’s (followers of the companions) of the  Prophet (may God favour and preserve him!) who are supposed either to have  visited Andalus or to have settled in that country at the time of its invasion by the  Moslems.   It is doubtful whether any of the as’hdéb (companions) of our holy Prophet were As‘héb (com-  ever in Andalus. Indeed, there are not wanting Eastern writers who even deny anions).  that any of the ¢dbi’s ever set foot in that country. Andalusian authors, on  the contrary, positively assert that one of the lesser as’hdb resided for some time -  among them, and also that a considerable number of the fdbi’s entered with Misa  Ibn Nosseyr at the time of the conquest, and settled in various parts of Andalus.  Ibn Habib,? for instance, assures us, that Al-muneydhir, one of the lesser as‘hdb,  resided in Andalus. The same writer, who counts Misa Ibn Nosseyr himself in  the number of the ¢dbi’s, gives the names of three other tdbi’s,—’Ali Ibn Rabah Al-  lakhmi, Hayat Ibn Rejé At-temimi, and Hansh Ibn ’Abdillah As-san’éni, all of  whom are said to have left Syria in company with Misa Ibn Nosseyr, when he went  to take possession of his government of Eastern Africa, and to have followed that   VOL.

"    4 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Boox v.    with irons: he at last obtained his pardon and was set at liberty. Hansh passes  likewise for the first man who ever filled the office of tax-collector in Africa. He  died in that country, or, according to others, at Saragossa, in the year 100. Ibn  Habib, who mentions this ¢db:’ in the number of those who entered Andalus with  Misa Ibn Nosseyr, asserts that he was the same man who, on the discovery of  Cordova from the top of the mountain-pass called Feju-l-meydah"" (the pass of the  table), began to call the soldiers to prayer, although it was not then prayer-time :  being asked by his companions why he summoned them at so unseasonable an hour,  he answered, ‘‘ Because prayers to the Almighty shall be heard in yonder plain until  ‘‘ the hour of the last judgment has arrived.” Time, however, has shown that this  good man’s prophecy was not to be fulfilled, although this tradition has been handed  down by a considerable number of writers. God only knows whether it rests on  a solid foundation or not. It is mentioned by Ibn ’Asakir, who, in his history of  the companions of the Prophet, has treated extensively of this Hansh. The same  writer (Ibn ’As4kir) agrees in making Hansh a native of San’, a small town of Syria,  which, he observes, is not to be confounded with the large city of that name in  Yemen. Ibnu-l-faradhi says that he inhabited Saragossa, where he laid the founda-  tions? of the great mosque; that he died in that city and was buried close to  the gate of the Jews in the western part of the city ;!° and that the people of  Saragossa were in the habit of saying that ‘“‘ the honour of preserving among them  ‘the mortal remains of Hansh was sufficient for them:” to which may be added  what Ibnu Bashkiwal says of this individual, namely, that he arranged the kiblah  of the mosque of Elvira, and took also the level of that of the great mosque  at Cordova, which we have fully described elsewhere as one of the wonders of the  world.   Others pretend that as Hansh is not quoted by Syrian traditionists, but only by  people who inhabited Cairo, this would imply that he lived in Egypt, not in the for-  mer country. Be this as it may, it appears certain that Hansh preserved traditions  from the mouth. of ‘Abdullah son of ’Abbds, the uncle of the Prophet : the following  is one. Hansh had a sword with a gold hilt to it: he happened once to meet  *Abdullah, who, seeing him with it, said to him, “‘ If thou wishest to be acceptable  ‘ to thy Lord, let the hilt of thy sword be made of iron, and of no other material ;”  which advice Hansh instantly followed. They say that when ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn  Merwdn invaded Africa with Mu’4wiyah Ibn Khodeyj in the year 50, he lodged  at the house of Hansh, who repeated to him the above words of ’Abdullah Ibn  ’Abbas, and that ’Abdu-l-malek was so pleased, that when after the rebellion of Ibn  Zubeyr, Hansh fell into his hands, as we have elsewhere related, he remembered  him and granted his complete pardon. Ibn ’Asdkir calls him simply Hansh,",22,book_5,
"    CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN, 5    -without stating, like Ibn Wadhdhéh and the rest of the authors we have quoted, that  his name was Huseyn, and that Hansh was a by-name. He may be right for aught  we know, but God only is all-knowing !   Ibn Ytinas has preserved us some account of the habits and mode of life of this  illustrious tdbi’, which he held in a straight line from him: he says that ‘‘ Whenever  “ Hansh, after partaking of his evening meal and finishing his daily occupation,  ‘* wished to say his nightly prayers, he used to light his lamp, and place a Kordén  “‘ by the side of his couch, and a tub of water to perform his ablutions. He would  “then rise to say his prayers in the middle of the night; and if he felt himself  ‘* overcome by sleep, he would sniff up water in order to rouse himself. If in  “ reciting from his Korén he made any mistake, he would take up the book, and  “ refer to the passage: lastly, if a beggar came up to him and asked him for food,  “he would not cease calling to his servants to give him what he wanted until he  “* saw that he was satisfied.”   Abi Abdillah [’ Alt] Ibn Rabdh Al-lakhmt.—Of this tdbi’, Ibn Yiinas in his history thn Rabin.  of Egypt says that he was born in the year 15 of the Hijra (beginning Feb. 20, a.p.  733), better known as the year of Yarmik;'* that he was blind of one eye,  which he lost at the naval battle of Dhatu-s-sawdri,'® wherein he fought under  the orders of ’Abdullah Ibn Sa’id in the year 34 of the Hijra, and that at a subse-  quent period he joined in the insurrection of the tribes of Yemen, who had settled in  Egypt, against the Khalif ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Merwan. After this, Ibn Rabah became  a great favourite with ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Merwan, so that when Ummu-l-baneyn,  daughter of that prince, was to be married to ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Merwan, it was he  who was charged by the father to conduct the bride to the bridegroom’s dwelling.'®  However, ’Abdu-l-’aziz being in the sequel displeased with him, he was banished the  capital and ordered to join the army of Africa, where he remained until the time of  the invasion of Andalus, when Misa took him into his suite. It is generally admitted  that Ibn Rabah died in the first-mentioned country in the year 114 (beginning  March 2, a.p. 732), or thereabouts. Ibnu Bashktwal, citing Ibn Mu’ayn, says that  the Egyptians used to pronounce the name of this édébi’ ’Ala or ’Ali, with a fataha  on the ’ayn; whilst the people of ‘Irak always called him ’Ola, making his name a  noun of the form fo’la; and that in confirmation of the above opinion they (the  Egyptians) were in the habit of quoting the following words of his son Misa: “ If  ‘any one call me Misa, son of ’Ola, making this word a diminutive of ’Ala,  ‘* T shall not consider that he alludes to me.”   Abii ’Abdi-r-rahmdn ’ Abdullah Ibn Yeztd Al-ma’dfert Al-jobelf——Ibnu Bashkiwal, ‘Abdullah Thu  treating of this ¢dbi’, says that he held traditions from Abt Ayib Al-ansdri and Yes  *Abdullah Ibn ’Amru, both companions of the Prophet, and that he himself was",23,book_5,

Ibn  Yiinas says that he died in Eastern Africa close upon the year 100 of the Hijra  (beginning August 2, a.p. 718), and that he was a virtuous and benevolent man.  There are, however, some Andalusian writers, chiefly those ‘who were natives of  Cordova, who assert that Abt ’Abdi-r-rahman Al-jobeli died and was buried in that  city, and that his tomb, which might be seen in the western quarter of Cordova, was  very much visited, and held in great veneration by the people. Which of these  two accounts is the true one, God only knows !   Hayydén Ibn Abt Hoblah.—Of this tdbi’, Ibnu Bashkiwél says that he was a  mauli (member by incorporation) of the illustrious tribe of Koraysh ; and that his  surname was Abi-n-nadhar. Of the same opinion is Abd-l-’arab Mohammed Ibn  Temim,'’ who, in his history of Eastern Africa, states that he had heard Farat Ibn  Mohammed say that when the Khalif ""Omar Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz decided upon sending  to Africa some men of known piety and learning to instruct the Berbers in the  duties of the Mohammedan religion, Hayydn was one of the ten theologians chosen  for that mission. Hayydn used to record traditions handed down to him by  *Amru Ibnu-l-’éss, ""Abdullah Ibn ’Abb4s, and Ibn ""Omar, (may God be pro-  pitious to them all!). According to some writers, Hayyan died in Africa in the  year 122 (beginning 6th Dec. a. p. 739) ; according to others, in 125 (beginning  3rd Nov. a. p. 740). Not one of the above-mentioned writers says a word  about the residence of this ¢débi’ in Andalus; but Ibnu-l-faradhi relates that  Hayydén went to that country with Misa Ibn Nosseyr, whom he accompanied in  all his expeditions until he arrived at a fortress called Karkashinah (Carcassonne),  where he died. ‘I was told,” continues that historian, ‘‘ by Abi Mohammed Ath-  ‘« theghri, that Carcassonne is a city distant five-and-twenty miles }® from Barcelona,  “and that when the Moslems conquered it, they found a magnificent church, called  “‘ by the Christians Santa Maria, wherein were seven pillars of massive silver; so  “* beautifully wrought, that no human eye ever saw the like of them; so huge were  “‘ their dimensions, that a man could hardly encompass one within his arms  “ extended.”   ’ Al-mugheyrah Ibn Abt Burdah Nashitt Ibn Kendnah Al-’adhrt.—We have no other   account of this ¢dbi’ than that preserved by Al-hijari in his great historical work,  namely, that he held traditions from the mouth of Abi Horeyrah (may God be  favourable to him !), and that he himself was cited by Malik Ibn Ans in his great  collection of traditions entitled Mowattd. Al-mugheyrah is likewise slightly men-  tioned by Al-bokhari in his larger work.!® Ibnu Bashkiwal says that he invaded  Andalus with Musa Ibn Nosseyr, although it would appear that that general  dismissed him from his army. ;    ",24,book_5,
"    CHAP. 1.) DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 7    Haydt Ibn Rejd At-temtmt.—According to Ibn Habib, this ¢ébi’ entered Andalus in Hayit Ibu  the suite of Misa Ibn Nosseyr. The statement is corroborated by Ibnu Bashkiwal  in a compilation of his entitled ‘‘ Admonition and explanation respecting those  among the ¢dbi’s who entered Andalus,”’™ as well as by Ibnu-l-abbar, who professes  to derive his information from one Abi-l-khatt4b Ibn W4jib, who held it from the  mouth of that ¢dd:’ himself. It must, however, be observed, that he (Ibnu-l-abbar)  calls him Rejé Ibn Hayét, a name totally different from that given him by Ibn  Habib. Which of the two was his true name, God only knows !   *Tyddh Ibn ’ Okbah Al-fehrt.2\—He was one of the édbi’s most renowned for virtue fe   and sanctity of life. He is counted by Ibn Habib among those pious and honest  Moslems, four in number, who in the partition of the spoil made at the time of the  conquest of Andalus were righteous with the men, and took no more than their own  legitimate share of the plunder. As the above tradition, which Ibn Habib held from  Ibn Rabi’ah, has been preserved by the historian Ibnu Bashkiwél, we shall transcribe  it at length. ‘I was told,” says Ibn Habib, ‘‘ by Ibn Rabi’ah, ‘ All the people who  “came to the conquest of this country (Andalus) were guilty of rapine and in-  ‘« justice towards their comrades, by abstracting some portion of the spoil, and not  “sharing it with them. Four men only, who belonged to the illustrious class of  “ the ¢dbi’s, are exempt from this charge: Hansh As-san’dni, Abi ’Abdi-r-rahman  “ Al-jobeli, Ibn Shamdsah, and ’Iy4dh Ibn ’Okbah.’”   We have treated elsewhere of the immense spoil found by the Moslems in some of Spoils found st  the cities of Andalus, but chiefly in Toledo, Cordova, Seville, and Merida, which, as conquest.  before mentioned, had been at different epochs the places of residence of the Gothic  kings ; but, since we have touched upon this subject, we cannot pass over in silence  the accounts of some trustworthy men who were present at the conquest, or who lived  very near the time, and whose words have been preserved and handed down to pos-  terity through a continuous chain of doctors. Al-leyth Ibn Sa’id,” after enume-  rating the rich spoil of every description, and the large masses of gold and silver,  which fell to the lot of some of the Arabs who accompanied T4rik and Misa to  Andalus, says that it was a common thing for the lowest men in the army to find  at the plunder of a city splendid robes embroidered with gold flowers, magnificent  gold chains of exquisite workmanship, and long strings of matchless pearls, rubies,  and emeralds. We have also read in an historical work that the plunder found by  Tarik at the taking of Toledo, whether in money or jewels, was beyond calculation,  and baffled all description. It is asserted that there were found among other  precious objects one hundred and seventy diadems of the purest red gold, set in  pearls, rubies, and every other sort of precious stone, one thousand swords for the  king’s own use, several measures™ full of pearls, rubies, and other gems, besides",25,book_5,

So great were in many  instances the eagerness for plunder and the ignorance of some of the conquerors,  especially the Berbers, that whenever two or more warriors of this latter nation fell  at the same time upon an article of plunder which they could not conveniently  divide, they hesitated not to cut it in pieces and share it among themselves, whatever  its materials or workmanship might be. In illustration of this, it is related that at  the taking of Toledo, two Berbers found a most splendid carpet ; it was interwoven  with gold worked in stripes, and was, besides, ornamented with chain-work of the  purest gold. The ground of the carpet, moreover, was sprinkled with pearls, rubies,  emeralds, and every description of costly gem. They at first carried it for a while  between them ; but, finding it too heavy, they soon put it down, when one of them  went to fetch a hatchet, and cut the carpet in two, one taking away the one half,  and the other the remainder. All this, moreover, they effected quite unperceived,  as their comrades, who were very numerous upon that occasion, were busy in  plundering another quarter of the city.   The same author before mentioned, and another named Yahya Ibn Sa’d, say some-  thing about the extortions and rapine of some of the officers and soldiers engaged in  the conquest of Andalus. They relate that a party of men, having collected together  several valuable objects which they had concealed from their comrades, seized on  some vessels, and set sail, to return to their homes. Scarcely however had they lost  sight of the land, when they were assailed by a most terrific storm of wind, and they  heard a voice which said, ‘‘O my God, drown them all!” The culprits then took  to their Korans and began to pray, but it proved of no avail to them; for the storm  continuing with unabated fury, the ships were dashed one against another, and every  soul on board drowned. It is not ascertained who the sufferers on this occasion  were; for the people of Egypt, on whom the calamity is said to have fallen, deny the  fact altogether; and as to the Andalusians, they say that it was the conquerors  of Sardinia who met with so signal a chastisement from the Almighty. God only  is all-knowing ! .   Zoreyk Ibn Haktm.—This is another of the tdbi’s who entered Andalus in the suite  of Misa Ibn Nosseyr. It is so related by Abti-l-hasan Ibn An-na’mah, on the  authority of the Abi-l-motref ’Abdu-r-rahman [Ibn] Yusuf Ibn Ar-rafé Al-kortobi,  in whose handwriting he read the statement. According, however, to the Hafedh  Abi ’Abdillah Al-kodhé’%, Zoreyk is not mentioned either by Ibnu-l-faradhi, or by  other writers who have given the names of the tdbi’s who entered Andalus at the  time of the conquest.   Zeyd Ibn Kédssed As-seksekt™ is likewise counted by Ibnu-l-abbér among the  tdbi’s who invaded Andalus, and were present at the conquest. He was originally",26,book_5,

He himself  has been cited by several doctors, in the number of whom are ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn  Zeyyad Ibn An’am Al-ifriki and Ya’kib Ibn Sufydn: the latter attributes to him  one of the traditional stories contained in the collection formed by Al-homaydi.   Abii Zor’ah Ibn Rih Ash-shimt.—This individual is also counted by the Kadi Abs Zoran.  Muhéfjir Ibn Theofil in the number of the ¢dbi’s. He left a son, named Moslemah  Ibn Zor’ah, who cited him as his authority in several traditional sayings which he  preserved.   Mohammed Ibn Aus Ibn Thabit Al-ansdrt.—According to Ibnu-l-abbar, who read peo   it in the handwriting of Ibn Hobeysh, this individual was also a tdbi, and held  traditions from the mouth of Abi Horeyrah, one of the companions of the Prophet.  Al-homaydi speaks of him in these terms: ‘‘ Mohammed Ibn Aus was an honest  “and religious man, remarkable for his talents and his theological learning. He  ‘* commanded the Moslem fleet in the year 93 (beginning Oct. 18th, a.p. 711),  “and was present at the conquest of Western Africa and Andalus by Misa Ibn  ““Nosseyr.” Abt Sa’id Ibn Yiinas, in his history of Egypt, corroborates the above  statement, and gives besides the names of all those doctors who held traditions from  him; as Al-harith Ibn Yezid and Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmdn Ibn Thaubdn.  Another writer, ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakem, who is also  the author of a history of Egypt, says that Mohammed Ibn Aus was on the sea  of Tunis in the year 102 (beginning July 11th, a.p. 720), and that when Yezid  Ibn Abi Moslem, governor of Eastern Africa, was put to death, he was appointed by  the army to succeed him. This happened during the Khalifate of Yezid Ibn ’Abdi-1-  malek Ibn Merwin. Mohammed Ibn Aus is moreover reported to have held the  government of that country until the arrival of Besher Ibn Sefwan Al-kelbi, who,  leaving his brother Handhalah to govern Egypt in his absence, took into his own  hands the government of the Mohammedan provinces of Eastern Africa.   Abii ’Amru ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ibn Shamdsah Ibn Dhtb Al-fehrt.—This tdbi’ held ’abdu-r-  traditions from Abi Dharr, or, according to other accounts, from Abi Nadhrah, Shama  who held them from Abi Dharr: he held them also from ’Ayeshah, the widow  of the Prophet, from ’Amru Ibnu-l-’iss, his son ""Abdullah, Zeyd Ibn Thabit, Abi  Nadhrah Al-ghaffiri, ‘Okbah Ibn ’A’mir Al-johani, ’Auf Ibn Malik Al-ashja’i,  Mu’awiyah Ibn Khodeyj, Moslemah Ibn Mokhlid, and Abi Raham. The above in-  formation is borrowed from Ibn Ytinas in his history of Egypt, as well as from Ibnu  Bashktiwal, who, quoting Al-homaydi and Ibnu-l-abbar, counts him in the number  of the tdébi’s who entered Andalus. Ibn Ytinas adds, that the last doctor who, in  Egypt, received traditions from this db’, was Harmalah Ibn ’Amran.   Bekr Ibn Sawddah Ibn Themdimah Al-jodhdmt—He was surnamed Abi-th- Las uUeLS   VOL.

He preserved traditions delivered by several of  the companions of the Prophet ; as Abdullah Ibn ’Amru Ibni-l-’éss, Kays Ibn Sa’d,  Ibn ’Obadah, Sahl Ibn Sa’d As-sd’di, Sufydn Ibn Wahb Al-khauléni, Hossdén Ibn  Samh As-saddyi, and Hiyyan. However, the name of the last-mentioned individual,  who is said to have been one of the companions of the Prophet (may God favour and  preserve him !), and to have been present at the taking of Misr, is differently given by  Ad-darkatténi, who writes it Hiyydn; while Ibn Yunas is of opinion that it should  be written Hibén or Habdn. Be this as it may, certain it is that this Bekr pre-  served traditions from several of the as’hdb (companions of the Prophet), as Abi  Nir Al-fahemi, Abii ’Omeyrah Al-mdézeni; and, among the ¢dbi’s (followers),  As-sa’id Ibnu-l-musib, ’Orwah Ibnu-z-zubeyr, Rabi’ah Ibn Kays Al-hameli, Abt  *Abdi-r-rahman Al-jobeli, Zeyd Ibn Na’im a Sufyan Ibn Hani Al-  jeyshani, Sa’id Ibn Semar As-sebdyi, &c.   There are various opinions respecting the country where this tdbi’ lived and died.  Ibn Ytinas is of opinion that he died in Eastern Africa during the Khalifate of  Hisham Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek. Other writers assert that he was drowned in the  straits, in crossing over to Andalus, in the year 128 of the Hijra (beginning Oct. 2,  a.p. 745). Abdi Bekr ’Abdullah Ibn Mohammed Al-kayrwani Al-mdleki, in his  history entitled Riyddhu-n-nofis (the bowers of the mind), says, that Abi-th-  themdmah was one of the ten theologians sent to Africa by the Khalif Omar Ibn  *Abdi-l-’aziz, for the purpose of teaching the Berbers the duties of the Mohammedan  religion.. Al-homaydi counts him in the number of the tdébi’s who entered An-  dalus ; Ibnu-l-faradhi, however, does not.   *Abdullah Ibnu-l-mugheyrah Al-kendnt.—This individual, who was bound by oath  to the tribe of ’Abdu-d-dar, is mentioned by Abi Mohammed Al-assili (from  Arsilla) among the tdbi’s who entered Andalus at the time of its conquest by the  Moslems ; at least, such is the statement given by Ibnu Bashktwal in his work  entitled ‘ Admonition and Explanation,’ &c., as derived from the above-mentioned  author. Tbnu-l-abbér, however, declares that he never met with his name among  those of the tdbi’s who settled in Andalus; and Abi Sa’id Ibn Ytnas counts him  in the number of those who visited Eastern Africa, not Andalus. He adds, that he  held traditions from Sufyén Ibn Wahb Al-khaulani.   Besides the above-mentioned individuals, the historians of Andalus have preserved  to us the names of three persons who lived in more modern times, but who, having  lived to an extraordinary age, are supposed to have been on intimate terms with the  tdbi’s, and to have conversed with them. But in this, as in many other things, we  are inclined to think that the writers of that country have been led away by their    ",28,book_5,

Ibnu-l-abbér, for instance, does not hesitate to count among the  Andalusian ¢dbi’s one ’Abdullah, who showed himself in Andalus in very late  times, and who is said to have lived to a most unusual age, since he pretended  to have conversed with some of the ¢dbi’s. Ibnu-l-abbar adds, that according to a  written statement of Al-kaysi, which he had in his possession, the pretended tdbi’  communicated traditions to Abi Mohammed Ased Al-johanf.   The same observation may be applied to Ibnu Bashkiwél, who counts in the    number of the ¢dbi’s a black man named Mansiir Ibn Khozdmah,” who lived in Mansér Ibn    Cordova towards the year 330 (beginning Sept. 25, a.p. 941). That writer  pretends to have read in a collection of allegations formed by the Sheikh Abi  ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn ’A’yed the following statement of facts :  ‘** Among the men remarkable for their longevity who are known to have resided in  “this country (Andalus), I may count Manstr Ibn Khozdmah, who arrived among  “us in the year 330; so I find it asserted by Al-hakem Al-mustanser-billah, son  “* of ’Abdu-r-rahman An-nésir, Sultan of Cordova, who in one of his works, which,  “ written in his own hand, is preserved in the library (of this city), has the following  “* words,—‘ I received instruction from a black man from Stidén, who came to  ** Cordova in the year 329 (beginning 5th Oct. a. p. 740), and who styled himself  “‘ Manstir, son of Khozdmah, the freedman of Mohammed, the Lord’s messenger.  “He himself told me that he had lived in the time of the Khalif ""Othman Ibn  “Affin, had been with ’Ayeshah on the ‘day of the camel;’* had also  “been present at the battle of Sefayn; and, lastly, that his father Khozamah had  ‘been a liberated slave of the Prophet. Manstir left Andalus the ensuing year,  “« 330, and returned to Africa.’ ”   But all this statement has no foundation whatever, as the illustrious tradi-  tionist Ibn Hajar clearly proves in one of his works: (may God forgive him for  writing upon this subject what I am going to transcribe!). ‘‘ All this account  ‘ of Ibn Khozdmah is an absurdity, and a tissue of lies from beginning to end. Of  “the same stamp seems to be a tradition which I find recorded in the writings of    Khozimah.    “ Andalusian authors, purporting that Abd-l-hasan Ibn ’Othmdn Ibn Khattdb, pet    ‘* better known by the surname of Abi-d-donya, had lived to an extraordinary age,  “50 as to have been a friend of ’Ali Ibn Abi Talib, as likewise of the most illustrious  “among the companions of the Prophet, of all of whom he used to converse  ‘with the people, describing their figure, manners, and countenance; that he  ‘also saw ’Ayeshah, the widow of the Prophet; and, lastly, that he arrived in  “Cordova under the Khalifate of An-ndsir, and conversed with Al-hakem Al-  ‘“* mustanser-billah, then the appointed heir to the throne, which he occupied after  ‘the death of his father; that in one of these conversations he met with Abi Bekr    bn ""Othman,",29,book_5,

But other writers deserving of greater credit, and endowed with more sound  criticism, have not hesitated to assert that the pretended ¢dbi? was nothing else  than a liar and an impostor. The same judgment, we apprehend, is to be passed  upon the black man who forms the subject of the preceding article: he was  decidedly an impostor ; and if we have done so much as to put his name among  those of the honourable and illustrious followers of the companions of the Prophet,  it has been merely in order to shed greater light upon this interesting subject, and to  show our readers how cautious they must be in the perusal of those works by Eastern  or Western writers which treat exclusively of this matter, as they are well known to  abound with involuntary errors and inaccuracies like the above-mentioned.

Andalusian writers assert, entered their country at the time of Mtisa’s invasion, but  with regard to most of whom strong doubts and objections have been raised by the  writers of this country (the East), there were many others who, though not belonging  to either of the two above distinguished classes, the as’hdbs (companions) and the  tdbi’s (followers), were, nevertheless, illustrious by their birth, renowned for their  exploits against the infidels, or remarkable for their piety and learning, and who  became the fathers of a numerous progeny, the heirs of their virtues and talents.  Enough has been said elsewhere respecting Mtisa Ibn Nosseyr and his freedman  Tarik, who were the two principal instruments by which God Almighty was  pleased to achieve the conquest of so mighty a kingdom as that of Andalus,  to make it unnecessary that we should here return to the subject. But before we  proceed to mention some of the chiefs who assisted in the conquest, we must  here transcribe some verses which the author of the Mas’hab, and Ibn Alyasa’ in  his Mw’arrib,! quote as having been spoken extempore by Tarik when addressing  his followers, soon after his landing on the coast of Andalus. Ibnu Sa’id, who  transcribes them also in his great historical compilation, observes that he in-  troduces them not on account of their elegance or the wit they contain, but on  account of their appropriateness, and as coming from so eminent a man, who  was the chief instrument of the conquest of Andalus. They are as follows:   “We rode a caulked ship (prepared) for our crossing; yet Allah had well   “ nigh bought  “‘ Our lives, property, and families at the price of a Paradise.",31,book_5,

As to the sons of Ghittishah (Wittiza), whose treason, as before mentioned, was one  of the principal causes of the conquest, we are told that, wishing to have the treaty  entered into with Tarik confirmed, they appeared before this general and addressed  him thus: ‘‘ Art thou, O Térik! an independent prince, or dost thou acknowledge  “a lord?” To which Térik answered, ‘I am subject to an Amir, who himself  ‘‘ obeys the orders of a supreme commander.” Hearing which, the Barbarians  asked Térik’s permission to repair to Africa, and have an interview with Misa  Ibn Nosseyr, that he might confirm the treaty made with them; to which effect  they begged from him a letter explaining the whole of the affair, as well as  the conditions agreed upon at the time of the invasion. Tarik did as he was  desired, and the princes accordingly crossed over to Africa. They found Mitisa  in Western Barbary, preparing for his expedition into Andalus. Having been  made acquainted with the nature of their request, Mtisa examined and weighed  each of the propositions made to them by Tarik, as well as the services they  had rendered to the cause of the Moslems ; but, unwilling to take upon himself to  decide in their case, he sent them to the Khalif Al-walid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek,  then the Commander of the Faithful, holding his court at Damascus in Syria, with  a letter informing him of the purport of Térik’s message, and of the illustrious birth  and good services of the petitioners. Al-walid received the Gothic princes with  great kindness, and granted them many favours. He began by ratifying the treaty  entered into with Tarik, and gave each of them a deed under his own signature,  whereby he secured to them, their sons and posterity, the possession of all the  lands specified in their agreement with Tdrik. The same document provided  against any spoliation on the part of the Arabian settlers. This being obtained,  the Barbarian princes returned to Andalus, where, immediately after their arrival,  they were put in possession of all the estates of their father, which they divided  equally among themselves. Almand, who was the eldest, had for his share one  thousand farms in the west of Andalus, and, in order to superintend them, took  up his abode in Seville. Al-artebésh, who was the second, had an equal number  of estates in the centre of Andalus, for which reason he took up his residence at  Cordova; while the third and youngest of all? had his thousand farms in the  eastern parts of Andalus, and the districts of the Thagher,* for which reason he  established himself at Toledo. In this manner the three brothers enjoyed the  undisturbed possession of their respective estates in the very heart of the Moham-  medan dominions, until the eldest, Almand, died, leaving behind him one daughter",32,book_5,

But, to return to the subject we have  in hand:   Mugheyth Ar-rimf, the conqueror of Cordova.—Al-hijéri and Ibnu Hayyén call Mugheyth.  him Mugheyth® Ar-rimi (the Greek); but the former writer adds, that he was  not, properly speaking, a Greek, and that his genealogy was as follows: Mugheyth,  son of Al-hérith, son of Al-howayrith, son of Jeblah Al-ghosdni, son of Al-ayham.  When still a boy, he was taken prisoner in an inroad which the Moslems made  into the country of Rim (Greece), and, at the partition of the spoil, fell to the  lot of ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Merwan, who had him educated together with his own son  Al-walid, and, when arrived at the age of manhood, liberated him and gave him  a command in the armies of Africa. Thence he crossed over to Andalus at the  orders of Térik, who sent him forward against Cordova, which city he took in  the manner related in the fourth book of this work. After this, Mugheyth  quarrelled with Tarik, and also with Misa, Tarik’s master. He then accom-  panied them in their journey to Damascus, and returned victorious to Cor-  dova, where he settled and became the head and founder of the noble family well  known in Andalus as the sons of Mugheyth, one of whom was ’Abdu-r-rahman  Ibn Mugheyth, who afterwards filled the office of Hajib to ’Abdu-r-rahmdén Ibn  Mu’dwiyah, first Sultan of Andalus.   The author of the Mas‘hab places the taking of Cordova in the month of Shawwal  of the year 92 (Aug. a.p. 711). He says also that the church, whither the governor  and the garrison betook themselves after the taking of the city, held out for three  months, and was not taken till Moharram of the year 93 (Oct. or Nov. a. p. 711).  No account is there given of the year of Mugheyth’s birth, or that of his death.  Al-hijari says that he was brought up and educated with the sons of ’Abdu-l-malek  Ibn Merwdn at Damascus; that he was taught the Arabic language, in which he  soon became so accomplished a scholar, says Al-hijiri, that ‘‘ he composed both in..  “* prose and in verse as much as would fill this work, were I to attempt to transcribe  “it.” He was likewise trained to horsemanship and all manner of military  exercises, and acquired so great a reputation by his courage and skill, that he  was appointed to command the army destined against Cordova, and became ever  after celebrated by his prudence and deep acquaintance with all the stratagems  of war. We have related elsewhere how Mugheyth gained possession of that city,  and made the prince who commanded in it his prisoner, this being the only Anda-  lusian prince who fell at the time into the hands of the Moslems; some having  made their peace by becoming the subjects of the Arabs, whilst others insured  their safety by fleeing to Galicia.® ;",33,book_5,
"    16 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK Vv.    His adventure    witha Gethic He historian Al-hijari tells a very curious anecdote of a daughter of this captive   princess. prince. He says that when the Christian, with all his family, was brought  to the presence of Mugheyth, this general saw amidst the women of his harem one  who shone among them like the full moon among the stars. She was the  daughter of the Christian; and Mugheyth at first sight became so deeply enamoured  of her charms, that he instantly made advances to his fair captive. These she  most obstinately refused ; upon which Mugheyth gave her in charge to one of  his followers, instructing him to threaten her with immediate punishment unless she  complied with his wishes within a given time. At last the damsel feigned to give  way, and, having prepared a poisoned robe,’ granted Mugheyth the desired appoint-  ment. God, however, permitted that Mugheyth should in time be informed of her  determination by one of her servants, and he therefore declined the meeting.  They say that when Mugheyth was thus warned of the impending danger, he praised  God for his providential escape, and exclaimed, ‘“‘ By Allah! had this maiden’s  ‘soul been within the body of her father, Cordova would not have been taken  “ by night.”   It is likewise related, that when the Khalif Suleymdn, son of ’Abdu-l-malek, had  summoned to his presence Misa Ibn Nosseyr and Tarik Ibn Zeydd, and heard the  answer of the latter to the charges brought against him by his master, he punished  the former by depriving him of all his riches, and resolved upon restoring Térik to  the command of the Andalusian army. Before, however, carrying into effect this  determination, Suleyman consulted Mugheyth, and asked him what he thought of  Tarik’s administration whilst in Andalus. ‘‘ His administration was such,” answered  Mugheyth, “ that had he ordered the Moslems to turn themselves to any other point  ‘‘ than the kiblah in their prayers, I really think that they would have obeyed his  “commands without considering that they were infringing the laws of our holy  “« Prophet, and committing an impious act.” Such was the impression which these  crafty words produced upon the mind of Suleyman, that he instantly changed his  purpose, and refused to give Tarik the promised government.* They say that  as Tarik met Mugheyth some days after this occurrence, he said to him, “ I wish,  ““O Mugheyth ! thou hadst described me to the Khalif as a man whose authority  “‘ was resisted, instead of saying that the people of Andalus were so obedient  “to me.”—‘ I wish,” replied Mugheyth, ‘‘ thou hadst left me my captive; I  “‘ should then have left Andalus to thee ;” alluding to Taérik’s attempt to seize on  Mugheyth’s royal captive; the governor of Cordova, as elsewhere related.

According to other authorities he returned to Andalus, and fixed  his residence in Cordova, taking for his dwelling a magnificent building, which was",34,book_5,

The authors who  follow the former opinion allude, no doubt, to his first journey to Damascus, whither  he is known to have repaired soon after his taking Cordova. But it is an ascer-  tained fact that he afterwards returned to Andalus, with a message from Al-walid to Retum: to  Misa, whom he had orders to bring back, and whom he accompanied to Damascus.  Nor can there be any doubt that he visited Andalus a third time,’ since he or a son  of his became, as we have observed elsewhere, the stock of that noble and dis-  tinguished family the Beni Mugheyth, who multiplied themselves in Cordova, and  who became the centre of wealth, dignities, and power in that city, their importance  and consideration reaching the highest pitch. One of his descendants, named  *Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Mugheyth, was appointed Hajib by ’Abdu-r-rahmén, first  Sultan of Cordova. But to return.   We have already stated that Al-hijéri, in his Mas’hab, says that Mugheyth was a  witty poet, and that a whole volume might be filled with his verses; in proof of  which he quotes one which he is reported to have uttered extempore, addressing  himself to Miisa and Térik, when they took away his captive from him:   “ T served you both witb zeal, and yet you behaved ungratefully to me ;   ‘“‘ The East and the West shall henceforth see me your bitterest enemy.”  As a further proof of Mugheyth’s eloquence and readiness of speech, Al-hijari cites  the following answer which he once made to Misa. This general, after reprimanding  him before a crowd of people, said to him, ‘‘ Hold thy tongue, O Mugheyth ! ”—  “‘T shall,” replied he, ‘‘ for my tongue is full of joints, and I can easily fold it  “ until I come to the presence of our master, Al-walid, son of ’Abdu-l-malek.”   Aytb Ibn Habib.—Another of the illustrious individuals who entered Andalus Avét Iba  with Miisa Ibn Nosseyr was (Abii) Aytib Ibn Habib Al-lakhmi. He was a nephew  of that conqueror, being born of one of his sisters. He was present at all the  principal engagements, and distinguished himself very much by his courage and  skill, He was governor of Andalus for some time after the murder of ’Abdu-l-’aziz,  son of Mtisa, whom he succeeded in his office. But, as it is our intention to treat  of him when we come to speak of the governors of Andalus, we shall proceed  with our narrative.   ’Abdu-l-jabbdr Ibn Abt Salmah Al-korasht Az-zahrt.—This individual entered Abdu) jabir  Andalus with Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, who gave him the command of the left wing ™=-  of his army. He settled first at Beja, and afterwards at Badajoz. He was the  father of a numerous progeny, known as the Beni Zahrah, who. inhabited Seville,  whither they removed soon after the conquest.

Ibnu Hayyén, in his Muktabis, says  that ’Abdullah was the general of the Yemeni Arabs of the Damascus division,  under Yusuf Al-fehri, and that when ’Abdu-r-rahmdén Ibn Mu’dwiyah landed in  Andalus, this ’Abdullah was sent by him to oppose his progress. This commission  ’Abdullah gladly accepted ; for there existed a mortal feud between his own family  and that of Umeyyah, owing to his father ’Ammdr, who had been a partisan  of ’Alf, having been killed at the battle of Sefayn, whilst fighting under the banners  of ’Ali Ibn Abi T4lib, against the troops of Mu’awiyah. This ’Abdullah Ibn Sa’id  was the ancestor of the Beni Sa’id, Lords of Kal’ah Yahssob (Alcal4 la Real), many  princes, governors, generals, poets, and writers, such as the author of the Mugh’rib,  and many others, of whom we shall treat at length in the course of this narrative.

His  son, ’Abdu-r-rahmén, whom he brought with him to Andalus, was the father of  Yusuf Al-fehri, who governed that country for a considerable length of time, until  *Abdu-r-rahmén Ad-daékhel, the first of the Beni Umeyyah, deprived him of power  and life.   eynah Ton Haywah Ibn Muldbis Al-hadhramt.—According to Ibnu Bashkiwal this individual  entered Andalus in the suite of Mtisa. Ibnu Hayydn, however, postpones his  arrival'* to the year 123 (beginning Nov. 25, a.p. 740), when a considerable  number of Syrians, under the command of Balj Ibn Beshr, crossed over from Africa  and settled in Andalus, as we shall relate hereafter. He appears to have been  the chief of the Arabian tribes of the division of Hems (Emessa), who took up  their abode at Seville. He rose in arms against ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Mu’dwiyah,  but was defeated.   ap ’Othmdn Ibn Abt ’Abdah Al-korasht is another of the illustrious Moslems who  accompanied Misa Ibn Nosseyr to the conquest of Andalus.

As several Andalusian writers have left works wherein the names and genealogy  of all those Arabian tribes, branches of which settled in Andalus, are given in detail,  we might be spared the trouble of repeating here any portion of their writings ;  but this being an interesting topic, and one which, if well treated, may prove of  some assistance to the readers of this our work, we have deemed it opportune to  record the names of the principal Arabian tribes which sent settlers to Andalus,  either at the time of the conquest, or at a subsequent period ; for which end we have  borrowed our information from the most approved sources.   The great stock of ’Adndn, from which issued the Beni Khandéf, and from  these the Beni Koraysh, and from these latter the Beni Héshim, sent numerous  families to Andalus, where they might be found under various denominations.  Ibn Ghalib,’ in his Forjatu-l-anfus, tells us that families descended from the noble  stock of Hashim, of the tribe of Koraysh, were very numerous in Andalus. He  adds, that they all descended from Idris, son of ’Abdullah, son of Hasan, son of",38,book_5,

As to the last-mentioned family (Beni Umeyyah), we need scarcely say that it BeniUmeyyah.  gave several Khalifs to Andalus, whither they went to settle in great numbers.  According to Ibnu Sa’id, they were still known in his days under the patronymic of  Korasht ; for, although they at first called themselves Umavwt, from their progenitor  Umeyyah, they afterwards changed their patronymic into that of Korasht, from  Koraysh, the lateral branch of their parent stock. And this they did because they  saw that the people had taken a dislike to them, and would never forget the conduct  of their ancestors towards Huseyn, the son of ’Ali Ibn Abi Télib.2, (May God show  his favours to both !).   There was another family in Andalus who pretended to draw their origin from  Umeyyah, son of ’Abdu-sh-shems: we mean the Beni Zohrah,? who settled at  Seville, where they rose to power and distinction.   As to the Beni Makhzim, they might be found in large numbers all over Andalus. Makhzim.  To this tribe belonged the poet Al-makhzimi, the blind, who obtained so great a  celebrity by his writings. He was a native of Hisn Al-mudowwar (Almodovar).  Members of the same tribe were the illustrious Wizir and elegant writer in prose as  well as in verse, Abi Bekr Ibn Zeydtn (Al-makhzimi), and his son, Abi-l-walid  Ibn Zeydtin (Al-makhzimi), who gained still greater renown by his writings, and  filled the post of Wizir to Al-mu’tadhedh Ibn ’Abbad, Sultan of Seville.   Ibn Ghalib informs us that there were individuals in Andalus who took the  patronymic Jamaht, from Jamah ; and many also who took that of Ddrt, from ’Abdu-  d-dér. He adds, that there were likewise several families with the patronymic Fehrt, reur.  from Mohérib, son of Fehr ; all of whom belonged to that branch of the tribe of  Koraysh which genealogists have designated under the appellative Bent Koraysh  Adh-dhawdahir.* To this tribe (Fehr) belonged ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Kattan, governor  of Andalus, from whom descended the Beni Al-kasim,° princes renowned in history,  and the Beni Al-jadd, a family of eminent doctors and theologians. From the same  stock (Moharib, son of Fehr,) issued Yuisuf Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmadn Al-fehri, governor  of Andalus, in whose time ’Abdu-r-rahm4n Ad-ddkhel took possession of that  country, and founded therein a powerful and extensive empire for the race of  Umeyyah. This Yiisuf was of the posterity of ?Okbah Ibn Nafi’ Al-fehri, the cele-  brated conqueror of Africa. Ibn Hazm ® adds, that individuals of the tribe of Fehr  might be found in great numbers in various districts of Andalus, in possession of  wealth and importance.

In their number  were the Beni Al-waksh, of the tribe of Kendnah, a family which produced in all  ages men of the greatest merit and eminence, as the Kadi Abi-l-walid (Al-wakshi),  the Wizir Abi Ja’far (Al-wakshi), and the learned theologian Huseyn Ibn Jobeyr  (Al-wakshi), the author of the travels known by his name, and of whom mention  has been made under the head of his native place.”   The sons of Hudheyl, son of Mid’rakah,® son of Elyds, son of An-nadhr, fixed  their domicile in the vicinity of Orihuela, in the country of Tudmir (Theodomir),  and took the patronymic Hudhelf. Ibn Ghélib informs us that the sons of Teym,  son of Morrah, son of Odd, son of Tabikhah, son of Ely4s, son of Modhar, were  very numerous in Andalus, and that Abv-t-téhir, the author of the Makamdt  Al-laztimiyyah,® was one of them.   As to the sons of Dhobbah, son of Odd, son of Taébikhah, who were a branch of  the Beni Khandéf, and were issued from the great stock of the Beni Adnan, they  were not very numerous in Andalus. Not so the sons of Kays ’Aylan, son of  Elyds, son of Modhar, of the great stock of the Beni ’Adnd4n; for, according to Ibn  Ghélib, they might be found in considerable numbers all over Andalus, being  known under patronymic surnames taken from the collateral branches of their  parent stock. Some, for instance, took the patronymic Solamt, from Solaym, son  of Mansir, son of Ikrimah, son of Hafssah, son of Kays ’Ayl4n. One of them was  the celebrated theologian ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Habib (As-solamf), the companion and  disciple of Malik Ibn Ans. (May God be favourable to him!) Another was the  Kadi Abi Hafss Ibn ’Omar (As-solami), who ‘held the office’ of K4di-l-kod4 at  Cordova. Others might be found under the patronymic Hawdzent, which they  took from Hawézen, son of Mansiir, son of ""Ikrimah, son of Hafssah, son of Kays.  These, Ibn Ghalib informs us, were chiefly to be met with in the neighbourhood  of Seville and the adjoining districts. Others, again, took their patronymic sur-  name from Bekr, son of Hawdzen, &c. They were mostly domiciled in a town  three miles from the city of Valencia, in the eastern part of Andalus, although they  might also be found in considerable numbers about Seville and other principal  cities.   Originally from the same stock (Kays ’Ayl4n) were the Beni Hazm, who must  not be confounded with another family of the same name, to which the celebrated  traditionist Abi Mohammed Ibn Hazm Adh-dhéheri belonged, for these were  originally from Persia.   Others took the patronymic Sa’d{ from Sa’d, son of Bekr, son of Hawazen.  In this number were the Beni Juida,’° who fixed themselves chiefly about Granada,  where, Ibn Ghélib says, they obtained the command (of their tribe). Others took",40,book_5,

Individuals of this family, to which belonged Balj Ibn Beshr (Al-kusheyri),  governor of Andalus under the Khalifate, might be found in great numbers about  Granada.   The Beni Rashik are another family issued from the stock of Kays ’Aylan,  which settled in Andalus, where they were known under various patronymics ;  some taking that of Fezdrt, from Fezdrah, son of Dhobiydn, son of Yaghidh,""  son of Reyth, son of Ghattfan, son of Sa’d, son of Kays. ’Aylén. Others took the  patronymic Ashja’t from Ashja’, son of Reyth, son of Ghattfan, &c. Mohammed  Ibn ’Abdillah (Al-ashja’i), governor of Andalus, was one of their number.   Several families might also be found, which took the patronymic Thakeft, from Thaxit.  Thakif; but this is a point much contested among writers on genealogy; some  making them a branch of the tribe of Kays, and therefore the sons of Thakif,  son of Kays, son of Munabbih, son of Bekr, son of Haw4zen; whilst others assert  that all those individuals living in Andalus, who used the patronymic Ath-thakefi,  took it from Al-horr Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman Ath-thakefi, governor of Andalus, who  belonged to a tribe from the remnants of Thamtd.'? The above-mentioned are  the families issued from the tribe of Kays ’Aylan, and other branches of the great  tribe of Modhar, which settled in Andalus.   As to the sons of Rabi’ah, son of Nezdr, some called themselves Asedt, after Ravi'ah.  Ased, son of Rabi’ah, son of Nezdér; others Mohdribt, from Mohérib, son of  *Amru, son of Wadigah, son of Bukeyr, son of Kossay, son of Du’mma, son of  Jedilah, son of Ased, son of Rabi’ah. Ibn Ghalib tells us that the former settled  in the neighbourhood of Guadix, and peopled a district to the north of that city  to which they gave their name; the latter settled at Granada, where they became  the stock of the Beni ’Attiyah, one of the principal families of that city. Among  the descendants of Ased, however, those are considered most noble who draw their  origin from Jozaymah,""® son of Mid’rakah, son of Elyds, son of Modhar.   Some again took the patronymic An-namart, from An-namar, son of Kasett,  son of Hinb, son of Akssa, son of Du’mma, son of Jedilah, son of Ased. Of  this number were the Beni ’Abdi-l-barr, one of whom was the celebrated tradi-  tionist Abi Omar Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr (An-namari). Others, like the Beni Hamdin,  a distinguished family of Cordova, took that of Tagh’lobt, from Tagh'lob, son of  Wayil, son of Kasett, son of Hinb.   There were also many families in Andalus who assumed the patronymic Bekrt,  from Bekr, son of Wayil. Of these number was the family of the Bekriin",41,book_5,
"    Ayad.    Kantta’n,    Arabs of  Yemen.    Hostile to the  Beni Modhar.    24 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v.    (Bekrites), Lords of Onéba and the island of Saltis, one of whom was the famous  historian and geographer, Abi ‘Obeyd (Al-bekri). The preceding are, to our  knowledge, the branches of the tribe of Rabi’ah which settled in Andalus.   Respecting the tribe of Aydd,“ son of Nezdr, whom others make the son of  Ma’dd,—although the former opinion is the most correct,—many were the families  residing in Andalus who drew their origin from it and took the patronymic ’Ayddt.  In their number were the Beni Zohr, distinguished citizens of Seville,’® and many  other families which we do not mention for fear of protracting the present narrative  to too great a length.   The above are the tribes of the great family or stock of ’Adnén, which had  branches or families in various parts of Andalus, all being the descendants in a  straight line, and without admixture of any other lineage, from Isma’il, (on whom  be peace !).   As to the other great stock, the sons of Kahttan, genealogists are divided as  to their origin. Some make them also the sons of Isma’il; others the sons of  Hid. Al-bokh4ri inclines to the former opinion; other writers hold the latter.  Be this as it may, it is evident that the sons of Kahttan, also called Yemeniin  (Arabs of Yemen), settled in great numbers in Andalus, whither they carried  the same hereditary hatred, and the same animosity, towards the sons of Modhar,  and the other tribes of the line of ’Adn4n, which characterized them so well in  the East. Indeed, though inhabiting a country but partially subdued, and where  the unrelenting enemy of God was continually attacking them, the tribes descended  from the two rival stocks prosecuted as fiercely as ever their own private and  inveterate feuds, by which the state was shaken to its foundations, and placed  more than once upon the very brink of perdition,’® as we shall presently see  in the course of this narrative.   The Beni Kahttén, however, were more numerous in Andalus than their adver-  saries, and always obtained a greater share of power and influence in the country.  They would undoubtedly in the end have gained possession of Andalus, had not  the race of Umeyyah held so long the supreme power in the East, and had not  the Korayshites at a subsequent period agreed to give the command over the  two parties to a member of that house (’Abdu-r-rahman Ad-dakhel). Even after  this monarch had subjected the whole of Andalus to his sway, the western provinces  of the empire were still cut up and divided into districts, inhabited by tribes, clans,  and families,'? who, in case of need, clung to each other for protection, and who, in  times of rebellion or civil discords, were sure to stand one by another. This state  of things lasted until the days of Al-mansir Ibn Abi ’A’mir, who, as is well known,  usurped the supreme power. Being a shrewed politician, his first care after his    ",42,book_5,
"    CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 25    accession was to remedy this evil by appointing to the command of the troops  generals from various countries and tribes. So, for instance, the general of an  army would have under his orders a portion of each tribe, and a captain would  seldom command soldiers of his own tribe: by these means the wound was  cauterized, civil dissensions were somewhat allayed, and peace, if not friendship,  was established between the Arabian tribes inhabiting the western districts, although  they not unfrequently broke out in other parts of Andalus where the same precau-  tions had not been taken.   According to Ibn Hazm the whole of the tribes of Yemen are descended from  Jodhém, son of Kahlén, or of Himyar, son of Yashjab, son of Ya’rob, son of  Kahttdn, son of ’A’bir, son of Shdlekh, son of Arfakhshad, son of Sém, son of  Nth. According to other authorities they are the sons of Kahttén, son of Al-  hemeysa’, son of Yoktdn, son of Thébit,'® son of Isma’fl. Others again make them  the sons of Kahttaén, son of Hid, son of ’Abdullah, (son of Hiid, son of *Abdullah,)  son of Rabah, son of Haru, son of ’A’d, son of ’Amiiss, son of Arem, son of Sm;  but, as the various disputes and controversies to which the genealogy of these tribes  has given rise among writers on that science are well known, we need not mention  them here.   Some of the tribes issued from this great stock (Kahttdén), and domiciled in  Andalus, drew their origin from Kahldén, son of Sebd, son of Yashjab, son of  Ya’rob, son of Kahtt4n, and took the patronymic Kahldnt after his name. Others  took it from Azd, son of Al-ghauth, son of Thabit, son of Malik, son of Zeyd, Aza.  son of Kahlan. The members of this tribe were very numerous in Andalus, as  Mohammed Ibn Hani Al-albiri (Al-azdi), the famous poet, who belonged to the  Beni Muhlib,’® and Ahmed Ibn Ahmed (Al-azdi), an eminent historian. Others,  like the Beni Mazin, son of Azd, took the patronymic Ghosdnt, from Ghosén,  the name of a watering-place close to their habitation. To the latter-mentioned  family belonged the Beni Al-kali’ai, who, according to Ibn Ghalib, were dis-  tinguished citizens of Granada, the greater part of whom, however, fixed their  quarters at Sdlehah, a town on the road between Malaga and that city.   Others, again, took the patronymic Ansdri,® which they derived from the col- Ansér.  lateral branches of those two tribes which assisted the Prophet when he took refuge  in Medina. These were to be found in great numbers all over Andalus, a fact  which suggested to Ibnu Sa’id the following observation: ‘‘ It is really wonderful  “that no traces of this lineage should be found now-a-days in Medina, when  ‘‘it is notorious that they abound in most great cities in Andalus. I was told  “once by a man who, while at Medina, made every inquiry about individuals  “‘ belonging to those families, that he was only referred to one old man of the   VOL. II. E",43,book_5,

The patronymic Khazrejt, therefore, was taken by various of these families. In  their number were the sons of Sa’ad, son of ’Ob4dah, one of whom was Abi  Bekr ’Obd4dah Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Mai-s-sam4 (Al-khazreji). The Beni Al-ahmar,  Sultans of Granada, in whose days the whole of Andalus became the prey of  the enemy of God, (as we shall hereafter relate,) belonged also to that family,  and took the patronymic Khazrejf. To one of the sovereigns of this dynasty  Lisdnu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattib was Wizir.   Others were the descendants of Aus, brother of Khazrej, and formed their  patronymic Aust after his name; others took it from Ghdfek, son of Ma’dd, son  of ’Adnan, son of Hazzdn, son of Al-azd. However, instead of Ma’dd, some say  his brother, ’Akk,”"" son of ’Adndn, although the genealogists following the latter  opinion are decidedly in the wrong. Ibn Ghalib informs us that most of the  districts about Segura were denominated after the tribe of Ghdfek, which settled in  that country, and that to this family belonged ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Al-ghafeki, the  governor of Andalus, as well as the famous poet Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Abi-1-khissal  Ash-shekiri (Al-ghéfeki).   Among the descendants of Kahlin, some took the patronymic Hamddnt, from  Hamdan, who was the son of Malik, son of Zeyd, son of Aushalah, son of Al-  khiydr, son of Malik, son of Zeyd, son of Kahlén. Their domicile was at a town  still known by their name, seven miles from Granada (Hamdan). The Beni  Dhaha, governors of Granada, belonged to this family.   Another branch of the descendants of Kahlan took their patronymics from  Mad‘haj, the name of a hill of a reddish colour in Yemen, or, according to others,  that of the mother of Malik, son of Watta, son of Odad, son of Zeyd, son of  Kahlan. Of this number were the Beni Serrdj,* distinguished citizens of Cordova ;  and the Beni Tayy, who had their domicile to the south of Murcia, and took the  patronymic Tiyt.   Others, again, took the patronymic of Morddt, from Mordd, son of Malik, son of  Odad ;* to them belonged the castle of Mor4d (Morente ?), which stood on the  road between Cordova and Seville, and which, according to Ibn Ghalib, took its  name from them. Many were the individuals of this family who took the above-  mentioned patronymic.   Others were the descendants of ’Ans, son of Malik, son of Odad, and denominated",44,book_5,

We may count among them the Beni Sa’id, authors  of the historical work entitled Al-mugh’rib, and lords of a certain castle in the  province of Granada, known by their name Kala’h Bent Sa’td (the castle of the  Beni Sa’id). Some of the Mad’hajis, however, might be found, who took the patro-  nymic Zeydt, from Zeyd, who, according to Ibn Ghalib, was better known under  the name of Ibn Sa’d, son of Al-’ashirah, son of Malik, son of Odad.   There is still another branch of the tribe of Kahlin, who took the patronymic  Barri, after Barrah, son of Odad, son of Zeyd, son of Kahl4n. Of this number Barmah.  were the Beni Al-muntaser, learned theologians of Granada. It is thus stated by  Ibn Ghalib, who adds, that a portion of them took the patronymic ’A’milt, from  ’A’milah, a woman of the tribe of Kodha’ah, who was the mother of Hérith, son of  Oda, son of Al-hérith, son of Morrah, son of Odad ; such were the Beni As-sammak,  Kadis of Granada. This point, however, is.far from being settled, since there are  not wanting genealogists who make ’A’milah a man, and the son of Seba, son of ’A‘milan  Yashjab, son of Ya’rob, son of Kahttdn; while others, who make ’A’milah also  a man, say that he was the son of Kodha’ah.   . Many were also the families sprung from the above stock who assumed the  patronymic Khaulént, from Khauldn, son of ’Amru, son of Al-hérith, son of Morrah. Khaulin.   The castle of Khauldn, between Seville and Algesiras, took its name from them:   to this number belonged the Beni ’Abdi-s-salam, principal citizens of Granada.   Others took the patronymic Ma’dfert,* from Ma’dfer, son of Ya’dfer, son of Malik, Ma‘Ater.   son of Al-harith, son of Morrah, like Al-mansir Ibn Abi ’A’mir Al-ma’éfer{, ruler   of Andalus, and many more that we might mention. Others, again, took that of   Lakhmé (Al-lakhmi), from Lakhm, son of ’Amru, son of ’Oda, son of Al-harith, son Lakhm.   of Morrah, like Misa Ibn Nosseyr, the conqueror of Andalus, and Rabdh Al-lakhmi,   and the Beni ’Abbdd, Sultans of Seville, and many more, who were all the descendants   in a straight line from An-no’man, son of Al-mundhir, King of Hirah. The Beni   Al-bdji, who shone at Seville, and the Beni Wafid, also powerful citizens of that   place, may likewise be counted among the families which used in Andalus the   patronymic Lakhmt.   Others took it from Jodhém; as, for instance, Thudbah Ibn Saldmah (A1- Joana.  jodh4mi), governor of Andalus; the Beni Hid, who were kings of Eastern Andalus,  and the ancestors of Al-mutawakkel Ibn Hid, who became the absolute rulers of  that country after the Al-muwdhhedin (Almohades); and lastly the Beni Mar-  danish, who were also lords of certain districts in the east of Andalus. Ibn Ghalib  asserts, that a portion of the Beni Jodham settled about Kala’h Rabah (Calatrava),  and that the name of Jodham was ’A’mir, and the name of Lakhm, Malik, and that  both were the sons of ’Oda.",45,book_5,

Others among the descendants of Kahlén took the patronymic Kind, from  Kindah, who is better known by the name of Thaur, son of ’Afir, son of Oda, son  of Morrah, son of Odad; to this number belonged Yusuf Ibn Hardin Ar-ramédi  (Al-kindi) the poet: others, again, took that of Tojtlt, from Tojeyb, the wife of  Ashras, son of As-sekiin, son of Ashras, son of Kindah ; and lastly, there were not  wanting in Andalus families issued from that principal stock (Kahlan) that derived  their patronymic Khatha’mt from Khatha’m, son of Anmér, son of Arash, son of  ?Amru, son of Al-ghauth, son of Thabit, son of Malik, son of Zeyd, son of Kahlan.  We might quote, among others, the family from which Othman Ibn Abi Nesa’h  (Al-khatha’mi), the governor of Andalus, was issued; however, on this point  genealogists do not generally agree, for some make Anmér the son of Nadhr, son of  Ma’dd, son of ’Adnan.   The preceding are all the branches of the principal stock of Kahlan which  settled at various times in Andalus. We shall now proceed to enumerate those of  Himyar.   Himyar was the son of Seb4, son of Yashjab, son of Ya’rob, son of Kahttan.  Among his descendants some took the patronymic of Ro’aynt, from Dhi-ro’ayn,  who, according to Ibn Ghalib, was the son of ’Amru, son of Himyar; but whom  others make the son of Sahl, son of ’Amru, son of Kays, son of Mu’dwiyah, son of  Josham, son of ’Abdu-sh-shems, son of Wayil, son of Al-ghauth, son of Kattan, son  of ’Oreyb, son of Zohayr, son of Aymen, son of Al-hemeysa’, son of Himyar.  Al-hazemi,” in his genealogical treatise, pretends that Dhi-ro’ayn was the appel-  lative of ’Ozeym, son of Zeyd, son of Sahl, &c. Be this as it may, there can be no  doubt that there were many Arabs in Andalus who took the patronymic Ro’aynt ;  of this number was Abt ’Abdillah Ibnu-l-khayyatt (Ar-ro’ayni), the blind man, who  was a celebrated poet.   Others took the patronymic Assbaht, from Dht-assbah or Assbah, who, according  to Ibn Hazm, was the son of Malik, son of Zeyd, one of the sons of Sebd the  younger, son of Zeyd, son of Sahl, son of ’Amru, son of Kays, &c.; but who, in  the opinion of Al-hazemi, was the son of Kahlén. To this family is supposed to  have belonged the famous Imém Malik Ibn Ans. However, there can be no doubt  that the Assbahiin are descended from Himyar. Numbers of them were established  at Cordova, where they enjoyed great consideration, and held high situations.   Others took the patronymic Yahssobi, from Yahssob, who, in the opinion of Ibn  Hazm, was the brother of Dhi-assbah. They might be found in great numbers  about the castle of the Beni Sa’id, which is well known in the history of Andalus as  the castle of Yasshob. Others, that of Hawdzent, from Hawazen, son of ’Auf,  son of ’Abdu-sh-shems, son of Wayil, son of Al-ghauth: their domicile, according",46,book_5,
"    CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 29    to Ibn Ghalib, was to the east of Seville, and in that city, where they held high  appointments.   Others, Kodhd’t, from Kodha’ah, son of Malik, son of Himyar, whom some make Koahé’ah.  the son of Ma’dd, son of ’Adndn, although the genealogists who follow the latter  opinion are very few. Some of the Beni Kodhd’ah took also the patronymic of  Mahrt, from Mahrah ; such as the Wizir Abi Bekr Ibn ’Ammér (Al-mahri), who  usurped the kingdom of Murcia. Mahrah was the son of Jeyddn, son of ’Amru,  son of Al-héf, son of Kodha’ah.   Others took that of Huseynt, from Huseyn, son of Namar, son of Wabrah, son of Huseyn.  Tha’leb, .son of Halwdn, son of ’Amran, son of Al-h4f, son of Kodhé’ah. Others,  Tenikht, from Tentikh, who, according to Ibn Malik, was the son of Malik, son of  Fehr, son of Namar, son of Wabrah, son of Tha’leb, who, as Al-h4zemi says, was the  same as Malik, son of Fehr, son of Fahm, son of Kaymullah, son of Ased, son of  ' Wabrah. Others, Belawt, from Beli, son of ’Amru, son of Al-h&f, son of Kodha’ah ;  as, for instance, the Belayun of Seville. Others, Johent, from Joheynah, son of  Aswad, son of Aslam, son of ’Amru, son of Al-héf, son of Kodha’ah. These might  be found in great numbers about Cordova.   From Kelb, son of Wabrah, son of Tha’leb, son of Halwdn, many families in Ken.  Andalus took the patronymic Kelbt. We might point out thé“Beni ’Obddah, of  whom the Beni Jehwar, Wizirs and Kings of Cordova, formed part.

There were, again, in Andalus families with the patronymic Hadhramt, Hadhra-mau.  from Hadhra-maut; these abounded most in Murcia, Granada, Seville, Badajoz,  and Cordova. Ibn Ghalib asserts also that they were in great numbers in  Andalus, and observes that great difference of opinion existed in his time among  genealogists as to the ancestors of Hadhra-maut, whom some made the son of  Kahttdn, and others the son of Kays, son of Mu’4wiyah, son of Josham, son of  ’Abdu-sh-shems, son of Wayil, son of Al-ghauth, son of Jeyddn, son of Kattan, son  of Al-’oreyb, son of Al-’araz, son of the daughter of the son of Aymen, son of  Al-hemeysa’, son of Himyar. Of the latter opinion is the celebrated genealogist  Al-hézemi.   There were also individuals in Andalus who took the patronymic Salmdnt. Of samén.  this number was the Wizir Lisdnu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattib, as we shall have further  occasion to show in the course of the present work.",47,book_5,
"    ""Abdu-l-’aziz  left as gover-  nor of Andalus.    Marries Rode-  ric’s widow.    30 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v.    CHAPTER IV.    *Abdu-l-’aziz left as governor of Andalus—Marries Roderic’s widow—Is put to death—Succeeded by  Aydb—Al-horr—As-samh appointed—lIs killed in battle—Succeeded by ’Abdu-r-rahmfn Al-ghéfeki—  Appointment of ’Anbasah—Rising of Pelayo—Death of ’Anbasah—’Odhrah is appointed by the army—  Replaced by Yahya Ibn Salmah—Arrival of Hodheyfah—’Okbah appointed by the Wali of Africa—  Invades the country of the Franks—Is succeeded by ’Abdu-]-malek.    In the absence of Miisa, who, as before related, left Andalus in the month of Dhi-l-  hajjah of the year 95 (Aug. or Sept. a.p. 714), his son, ’Abdu-l-’aziz, remained as  governor of the country. ’Abdu-l-’aziz collected together the scattered forces of  the Moslems, fortified the frontiers, and greatly contributed to the consolidation  of the Mohammedan power, and to the extension of the limits of the conquest, by  subduing several important fortresses and cities which had hitherto escaped the eyes  of his father and Tarik.' His administration was in every respect that of an upright  and wise prince. It was unfortunately of very short duration, the army having  revolted against him, and put him to death towards the close of the year 97 of the  Hijra? (beginning Sept. 4, a. p. 715), in the second year of his administration.   It is generally believed that the assassins of ’Abdu-l-’aziz had received instructions  to that effect from the Khalif Suleyman, the same Sultan who, as has been related  elsewhere, had behaved so unjustly towards his father, Misa. They say that Suley-  man was instigated to this act of cruelty by some of his courtiers representing  ’Abdu-l-’aziz as a bad Moslem and a rebellious subject. Among the various charges  brought against him, one was his having married the widow of King Roderic, who  was called by the Arabs Umm -’A’ssem.? This woman had at the time of the conquest  obtained from the Moslems security both in her person and property on condition  of paying a certain tribute ; she was, therefore, living unmolested in the free use of  her religion, and enjoying a considerable fortune, of which she was possessed, when  ’Abdu-l-’aziz became deeply enamoured of her charms, and married her. ’Abdu-l-  ’aziz always showed the greatest attachment to this woman; he went, they say, so  far as to reside with her in a church at Seville,* an act by which he raised the",48,book_5,
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 31    indignation of every true believer. One day his wife said to him, ‘‘ Why do not  “‘ thy subjects bow down in thy presence, as the Goths used to do before my late  “husband, King Roderic ? ”—* Because,” replied ’Abdu-l-’aziz, ‘‘ such practices  “ are contrary to our religion.” Umm-’A’ssem, not being satisfied with this answer,  renewed her entreaties, and ’Abdu-l-’aziz, who doted upon her, fearing lest the  want of such ceremony, and the apparent want of respect on the part of his people,  should diminish her attachment to him, caused a small door to be opened in front  of the room where he generally sat to give audience, so that any Moslem entering  his presence was compelled to bend himself in order to pass through it. He then  made his wife believe that this was a mark of deference to him, and she seemed  satisfied. This circumstance being rumoured abroad, and talked of among the  soldiers, became, together with the suggestions of the agents of Suleym4n, the cause  of the death of ’Abdu-l-’aziz (may God forgive him!). ’Abdu-l-’aziz was a brave and  experienced officer ; he displayed great abilities as a general, and during his govern-  ment many important cities were subdued by the Moslems. He was murdered, as Is put to death.  above stated, in the last days of Dhi-l-hajjah of the year 97, after a government of  two years.© They say that when the head of ’Abdu-l-’aziz was brought to  Damascus, the Khalif Suleyman summoned to his presence Misa Ibn Nosseyr, and  showed it to him. ‘‘ Dost thou know whose head that is?” said Suleyman to the  wretched father. ‘‘ Yes, I do,” answered Misa, ‘“‘ it is the head of a man who fasted  “‘ and said his prayers. May the curses of Allah fall on it if his assassin was a  “ better man than he!” ®   *Abdu-l-’aziz was succeeded in the government of the country by Ayib Ibn Habib a pare  Al-lakhm{, the son of Muisa’s sister. Ibnu Hayyaén says that Ayib was chosen by = ~  the army to command in Andalus, and that he was the first governor who resolved  upon transferring the seat of the government from Seville to Cordova, and who held  his court at the latter city, although other historians attribute this decision to his  successor, Al-horr. Aytb’s administration lasted six months,’ when he was suc-  ceeded by Al-horr. ‘ From this moment,” says Ibnu Khaldin, ‘‘ Andalus was  ‘© governed by a succession of Amirs, sometimes appointed by the Khalifs of the  “‘ East, and sometimes by the viceroys of Africa, who held their court at Cairwdn.  “Under their rule the Arabs made incessant war upon the Kdfirs (infidels) ; they  “took the city of Barcelona in the eastern part of Andalus, as well as the fortresses  “of Kashtélah® (Castile) and those of Narbonne, subduing all the intermediate flat  ‘“‘ country towards the north-west. The Gothic nations were nearly exterminated ;  ‘the Galicians, and such among the Barbarians as had escaped destruction on  “* former occasions, were compelled to fly for refuge to the mountains of Castile and  ‘“‘ Narbonne, and to strengthen themselves in the gorges and other spots strong by",49,book_5,

This, however, proved of no avail to them; for the Moslems, crossing  ‘* those natural barriers which, on the side of Barcelona, separate Andalus from  ‘* the continent, descended into the plains beyond them, and made incursions into  ‘* the land of the Franks, the Kdfirs becoming every where the prey of the impetuous  ‘“* waves of Islam. Unluckily discord and civil war broke out at times among the  ** conquerors themselves: the consequence was that eighty years had scarcely  ‘ elapsed since the conquest, when the Franks, profiting by the dissensions of the  ‘“* Moslems, snatched from their hands Barcelona and several other cities belonging  ** to those distant regions. God is great! He gives the empire to whomsoever He  “ pleases !””   But to return to our narrative. When Mohammed Ibn Yezid, who governed  Africa in Suleym4n’s name, heard of the death of ’Abdu-l-’aziz, son of Misa, he  immediately sent to Andalus Al-horr Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahm4n Ibn ’Othmén Ath-thakefi,  who divested Ayiib of the command, and administered the affairs of the Moslems  for two years and eight months, until he himself was replaced by As-samh Ibn  Malik Al-khauléni, who was appointed by the Khalif ‘Omar, son of ’Abdu-l-’aziz.  According to the historian Ar-razi, Al-horr arrived in Andalus in the month of  Dhi-l-hajjah of the year 98 (July or August, a.p. 717), bringing in his suite four  hundred men of the principal Arabian families of Africa, who became in after-time  the stock of all the nobility of Andalus. Ibnu Bashktwal says also that the dura-  tion of his government was two years and eight months,® and that it came imme-  diately after the insurrection of Aytib Ibn Habib Al-lakhmi.   Al-horr was succeeded in the government of Andalus by As-samh Ibn Malik  Al-khauldni, who, according to Ibnu Hayyd4n and Ibnu Khaldtn, was nominated to  that post by the Khalif Omar Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz. The first-mentioned writer says  that the appointment of As-samh took place in the month of Ramadhan, a. . 100,'°  (April or May, a. pv. 718); the latter says only that he came at the commencement  of the second century of the Hijra. However, it was he who caused the bridge at  Cordova to be rebuilt, after obtaining permission of the Khalif to that effect, as we  have related elsewhere.'' He also brought instructions from the Khalif to collect  for him the fifth of the spoil taken from those Christian provinces which had not  yet acknowledged the authority of Islam,'? and to write a description of the cities,  mountains, rivers, and seas in that country ; and this Omar caused to be done and  sent to him, that he might the better gain a knowledge of the countries conquered  by the Moslems, and estimate their resources, for he intended to make them  evacuate Andalus, dreading the dangers to which they might be exposed in a distant  country, away from their brethren in religion, and from the people speaking their  language. ‘ Would to God,” exclaims Ibnu Hayydn, ‘‘ that As-samh had lived",50,book_5,
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN, 33    ‘ long enough to complete the task intrusted to his care; for, in their transactions  ‘“‘ with the infidels, the Moslems of this country are fast working their own per-  “ dition, unless God Almighty, by his infinite mercy, be pleased to rescue them.”'*   After an administration of two years and eight months, As-samh died a martyr for !s killed in  the faith in the country of the Franks. Ibnu Hayydn relates, that, having invaded  the land of the infidels, he was surrounded by their forces, who poured on him on  all sides, and that not one Moslem escaped that disastrous affair, which was well  known in Andalus as ‘ the battle of Balatt,’'* and the spot itself as Balditu-sh-  shohadd (‘ the pavement of the martyrs’). He says also, that it was a common  opinion in his days, that on the very spot where so many Moslems fell, the voice of  an invisible muezzin was daily heard announcing the hours of prayer. According  to Ibnu Bashkiwal and Ibnu Khaldin, As-samh was slain on the day of Taru-  wiyah, a.H. 102.""   After the massacre of As-samh and his army, the Moslems of Andalus chose for falsnccrsied  their commander ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn ’Abdillah Al-ghdfeki, who is counted by Ibnu rahmén al-  Bashkdwal in the number of those tdbi’s who entered Andalus with Misa Ibn  Nosseyr. ’Abdu-r-rahman is further said to have preserved traditions from ’Ab-  dullah, son of ?Omar Ibnu-l-khattab.   Tbnu Khaldin tells us that this ’Abdu-r-rahm4n governed Andalus until the  arrival of ’Anbasah Ibn Sohaym Al-kelbi, whom Yezid Ibn Abi Moslem, then  ‘Wali of Eastern Africa, appointed to be his successor. Ibnu Bashkiwal states  that this took place in the year 110 (beginning April 15, a.p. 728), that ’Abdu-  r-rahmd4n owed his nomination to ’Obeydah Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman Alkaysi, Wali of  Eastern Africa, and that he fell a martyr in an encounter with the Christians of  Andalus in the year 115. So far Ibnu Bashkiwal, whose statement is in contradic-  tion with what we have related elsewhere ; namely, that immediately after the death  of As-samh in 102, ’Abdu-r-rahm4n succeeded him: for how could this be, when  Tbnu Bashkiwal asserts that he was appointed in the year 110? Which of these two  accounts is the correct one, God only knows. This difficulty, however, may easily  be surmounted by supposing ’Abdu-r-rahman to have been governor of Andalus  on two different occasions, as we find it stated by Al-hijéri. The following words,  which we read in Ibnu Hayydn, may also be of use in clearing the obscurity :—  ‘When ’Abdu-r-rahmén came to Andalus, in Safar, 113 (April or May, a.p.   ‘“« 731), for the second time, he was appointed by Ibnu-l-hajab, Wali of Eastern  “ Africa. He immediately made war upon the Franks, with whom he had some  “ sharp encounters, until his army was destroyed and he himself fell a martyr for  “ the faith in the month of Ramadhan, 114 (October, a. p. 732), at the spot known  “as the pavement of the martyrs (Baldttu-sh-shohadd).”   VOL.

"    Appointment  of ’Anbasah  Ibn Sohaym  Al-kelbf.    Rising of Pe-  layo.    34 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v.    Be this as it may, ’Abdu-r-rahmaén Al-gh4feki is described by Al-homaydi as  a man of great courage and considerable abilities, honest in his proceedings, and  impartial in his judgments: he attended in person to the distribution of the spoils  taken from the enemy, which he caused always to be made with the greatest equality  and fairness in his own presence. On this occasion ’Abdu-r-rahmén’s administra-  tion did not last long; since he was soon after replaced by ’Anbasah Ibn Sohaym  Al-kelbi, who was appointed by the governor of Africa, Yezid Ibn Abi Moslem.  According to Ibnu Hayydn, ’Anbasah was appointed to the government of Andalus  in Safar, a.u. 103 (August, a.p. 721), by Yezid Ibn Abi Moslem, the secretary  of Al-hej4j, then governor of Eastern Africa. Ibnu Bashkiwd4l says that he  introduced order into the administration, and made war on the Franks in person,  and that he died in the month of Sha’bén, a.a. 107 (December, a.pv. 725, or  Jan. 726), after a government of four years and four months,—others say eight  months. Ibnu Khaldin, who makes his government last four years and four  months, says that he died a martyr in an expedition into the land of the Franks.   “ During ’Anbasah’s administration,” says Ibnu Hayydn, ‘a despicable bar-  “ barian, whose name was Beld4y (Pelayo), rose in the land of Galicia, and, having  ‘* reproached his countrymen for their ignominious dependence and their cowardly  ‘flight, began to stir them up to revenge the past injuries, and to expel the  ‘Moslems from the land of their fathers. From that moment the Christians  “‘ of Andalus began to resist the attacks of the Moslems on such districts as had  “remained in their possession, and to defend their wives and daughters; for  “until then they had not shown the least inclination to do either. The com-  “ mencement of the rebellion happened thus: there remained no city, town, or  ‘* village in Galicia but what was in the hands of the Moslems, with the exception  “of a steep mountain on which this Pelayo took refuge with a handful of  “men: there his followers went on dying through hunger until he saw their  “numbers reduced to about thirty men and ten women, having no other food  ‘* for support than the honey which they gathered in the crevices of the rock which  “‘ they themselves inhabited, like so many bees. However, Pelayo and his men  “ fortified themselves by degrees in the passes of the mountain until the Moslems  “* were made acquainted with their preparations; but, perceiving how few they  “* were, they heeded not the advice conveyed to them, and allowed them to gather  “strength, saying, ‘What are thirty*® barbarians, perched upon a rock ?—they  “* must inevitably die.’” Would to God that the Moslems had then extinguished at  once the sparkles of a fire that was destined to consume the whole dominions of  Islam in those parts; for, as Ibnu Sa’id has judiciously observed, ‘‘ the contempt in  “ which the Moslems of those days held that mountain and the few wretched beings",52,book_5,
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 35    ‘* who took refuge upon it, proved in after-time the chief cause of the numerous con-  ‘* quests which the posterity of that same Pelayo were enabled to make in the  “territory of the Moslems,—conquests,” adds that excellent historian, ‘“ which  “ have so much increased of late years, that the enemy of God has reduced many  “* populous cities ; and, that at the moment I write, the magnificent city of Cordova,  “the splendid capital of the Mohammedan empire of Andalus, the court of the  “ Khalifs of the illustrious house of Umeyyah, has fallen into the hands of the  “infidels. May God annihilate them!”   Tbnu Sa’id was right; the forces of Pelayo went on increasing until he openly  raised the standard of revolt: he was succeeded by Alfonso, the progenitor of all  the Christian kings known by his name. This Alfonso resisted likewise the  authority of the Moslems, against whom he carried on incessant war; his power  and importance, as well as his states, increasing soon in such a ratio as not to be  easily obscured. But of this more will be said in the course of our narrative.   Some writers have asserted that ’Anbasah died a natural death as he was marching Death of ’An-  to attack the Franks, whilst others pretend that he was killed’” in an engagement  with them. Be this as it may, Ibnu Hayydn and Al-hijari say that after the death of Odhrah Ibn  this governor, which, as before stated, happened in Sha’ban, 107 (Dec. a. p. 725 or tppointed by  Jan. 726), the people of Andalus elected ""Odhrah""* Ibn ’Abdillah Al-fehri. ’Odhrah  is not counted by Ibnu Bashkiwdél among the governors of Andalus; but both  Al-hijéri and Ibnu Hayydn, who include him in their number, describe him as one of  the most distinguished Arabs who attended the conquest of Andalus,—a man of  great probity and courage, and whose posterity might still be met with in their  days at Guadix, in the kingdom of Granada. A son of this ’Odhrah, whose name  was Hish4m, made himself at a subsequent period the master of Toledo, the citadel  of Andalus.’? Ibnu Sa’id includes him likewise in the number of the governors  of Andalus, and says that he held his court in Cordova.   However, ’Odhrah seems only to have administered the government of the !* ears by  country until the arrival of Yahya Ibn Salmah Al-kelbi, who, according to Ibnu Selma  Bashkiwaél, and the above-mentioned writers, was appointed by Beshr Ibn Sefwan  Al-kelbi, W4li of Africa, at the solicitation of the Andalusians, who, on the death  of ’Anbasah, sent to ask him for a new governor. Yahya landed in Andalus  towards the end of the year 107 ; some authors add in the month of Shawwal.   He ruled Andalus for a period of eighteen months, some say two years and a  half, during which time he led no army in person against the infidels. Ibnu  Hayy4n’s narrative agrees on this point with that of Ibnu Bashkiwal. Cordova  seems to have been the place of residence of Yahya. Ibnu Khaldin, who includes  him in his list of Andalusian governors, repeats this statement, and adds that",53,book_5,
"    Arrival of  Hodheyfah.    36 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v.    Yahya was the first governor of Andalus appointed by the Walis of Africa, who,  from that time, always provided the governors of that country. The same writer  ({Ibnu Khaldtin] agrees in making the duration of Yahya’s rule two years and a  half.”   *Othman Ibn Abi Nesah Al-khath’ami,?? whom others call Al-lakhmi, was the  next governor of Andalus. According to Ibnu Bashkiwél and Ibnu Khaldin,  ’Othman was appointed to that post by ’Obeydah Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman As-solami,  Wali of Eastern Africa, in the month of Sha’ban, a.u. 110 (Nov. or Dec. a. pv.  728). The new governor fixed his residence at Cordova. He was, however, deposed  five months afterwards, and replaced by Hodheyfah Ibn Al-ahwass Al-kaysi, who,  according to Ibau Bashkiwél, was also nominated by the same Wali of Africa,  ’Obeydah. :   Hodheyfah arrived in Andalus in the month of Rabi’-l-awal, a. 4. 110 (June or  July, a.p. 728); he was almost immediately removed, some authors making the  duration of his government only one year. However, historians do not agree as to  the period of his administration ; some supposing that it preceded that of ""Othman,  others that it came afterwards.”   Hodheyfah was succeeded by Al-haytham Ibn ’Obeyd Al-keldbi,* who, according  to Ibnu Bashktiw4l, was appointed by ’Obeydah Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman, the Wali  of Africa, and arrived in Andalus in the month of Moharram, a.x. 111 (April, a.p.  729). Ibnu Khaldin says that he invaded the country of Makunshah,™* and  reduced it to the sway of Islim. Al-haytham died in the year 113 (beginning  14th March, a.p. 731), after a government of two years and some days, which  other historians make two years and four months.* This governor also held  his court at Cordova.   He was succeeded by Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Al-ashja’i, whom the people  of Andalus appointed to command them.%* Ibnu Bashkiwal, from whom the  preceding statement is borrowed, describes him as a virtuous and upright man. He  administered the affairs of the Moslems and presided over their prayers for the short  period of two months, after which time he appointed to the government of the  country ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn ’Abdillah Al-ghdfeki, the same Amir who had  performed those duties on a former occasion, and whose administration has already  been noticed by us. This time ’Abdu-r-rahm4n was appointed by ’Obeydullah  Tbnu-l-hajab, Wali of Africa, of which country Andalus was a dependency. ’*Abdu-  r-rahmén remained in the government until he was slain in battle with the Franks,  as before related, in the year 116, or, according to other authorities, in the year  115,” after an administration of one year and eight months, though there is a  tradition making it two years and six months. Ibnu Bashkiwél says that the",54,book_5,

According to Ibnu Khaldiin, who puts the death of ’Abdu-r-rahmdén in the year  114, this governor must have been absent from Andalus when he was nominated ;  for the words of that historian run as follow: ‘‘ After this, ’Abdu-r-rahmaén Ibn  * Abdillah Al-ghéfeki was appointed to the government of Andalus by ’Obeydullah  “ Tbnu-l-hajab, Wali of Eastern Africa. He arrived in Andalus in the year 113,  “and made war upon the Franks, with whom he had several encounters ; but in the  ‘“* month of Ramadhan of the year 114 (Oct. a.p. 732), his army was cut to pieces  “at a spot called Baldttu-sh-shohadd (the pavement of the martyrs), he himself  “ being in the number of the slain. This disastrous battle is well known among  “the people of Andalus as the battle of Baldtt. ’Abdu-r-rahm4n had governed  “ the country one year and eight months.”’ But to return.  After ’Abdu-r-rahman’s death, ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Kattan Al-fehri, whom Al-  hijari includes in his list of Andalusian governors, obtained the command. ’Abdu-l-  malek is considered by the said author (Al-hijari) as the stock whence the family of  the Beni Al-késim, Lords of Al-bont (Puente), and the Beni Al-jadd, one of the  principal families of Seville, are issued. ’Abdu-l-malek is likewise mentioned by  Ibnu Bashkiwal, who says that he was appointed to the government of Andalus in  the month of Ramadhdn, a. x. 114 (Oct. or Nov. a. p. 732), and that his adminis-  tration lasted two years,* although there are not wanting authors, as Al-wdkedi,  who make four years the duration of his government ; but those who do so have,  no doubt, been led into error by the circumstance of ’Abdu-l-malek’s governing  the country twice; since, as we shall presently show, he ruled over Andalus before  and after ’Okbah. He conducted various expeditions into the territory of the Basques,  one especially in 115, from which he returned victorious, and loaded with spoil.  He is, however, described by several writers as a man of cruel propensities, and -  excessive rigour in his judgments ; owing to which he was ignominiously deposed in  the month of Ramadhan, 116 (Oct. or Nov. a. p. 734), and replaced by ’Okbah  Ibnu-]-hejéj As-selili, who came to Andalus by the appointment of ’Obeydullah ’Okbah ap-  Ibnu-l-hajab, the Wali of Africa. The new governor was a man of great justice and Wali of Attica  irreproachable conduct, virtues which made him the idol of the Moslems. During the  five years of his administration he made many successful inroads into the country of Invades the  the Frahks, and hunted down the infidels in every direction, taking their cities and Franks, ofthe  castles by force of arms, until the Moslem settlements reached as far as Narbonne,  and their advanced posts” and military stations were established on the banks of the  Rodanoh (Rhéne). He had previously, in the year 111 (beginning April 4, a.p, 729),",55,book_5,
"    38 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book v. ©    converted the city of Narbonne into a sort of citadel, from which the Moslems  might sally out and scour the neighbouring country, for which purpose he stored it  with arms and provisions ; and many were the expeditions which he himself led into  the country of the Franks. But whilst intent upon extending his conquests, ’Okbah  lost no opportunity of spreading the religion of Islam; for, whenever he took  prisoners, he never would order their execution without previously inviting them to  embrace the only true religion, and setting before their eyes the gross errors and  impositions of their creed ; and this plan answered so well, that thousands of infidels  were converted at his hands.  ’*Okbah arrived in Andalus in the year 117, others say in the year before. He  was succeeded by ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Kattan, for the second time, although the  % succeeded manner in which this was effected is differently stated. Ibnu Khaldin says, “‘ In  malek, “the year 12] ’Abdu-l-malek rose against ’Okbah, deposed him from his govern-  “ment, and put him to death, or, according to others, expelled him from the  “country.” Ibnu Bashktiwal’s statement is, that ’Abdu-l-malek revolted against  ’Okbah, seized his person, and deprived him of the command of Andalus; but he  says that it was not clear whether he had him secretly put to death, or whether he  merely banished him the country.% Both authors, however, agree in saying that  this happened in the year 121 (beginning Dec. 17, a. p. 738), and that the usurper  retained the command during the remainder of that year and the two following,  122 and 123, until Balj came from Africa with the Syrian troops, and, having  subdued Andalus, made ’Abdu-l-malek his prisoner, and had him crucified in the  month of Dhi-l-ka’dah of the year 123. ’Okbah held his court at Cordova.  Ar-r4zi’s account differs considerably from the preceding. He says, ‘In the  ** month of Safar of the year 123 (Dec. a. D. 740, or Jan. 741), during the Khalifate  “ of Hish4m, son of ’Abdu-l-malek, the people of Andalus revolted against ’Okbah,  ‘‘and appointed in his stead ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Kattan, for the second time.  “*Okbah had governed Andalus for a period of six years and four months; he  “ died at Carcasonne*! in the same month (Safar, a. H. 123).”’ However, we find  that both Ibnu Khaldiin and Ibnu Bashkiwél give him only five years’ government.  Be this as it may, certain it is that ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Kattan usurped the power in  Andalus, and ruled as master over that country until the arrival of Balj Ibn Beshr,  who, escaping from the defeat of the Syrian army by the Berbers, at a place in  Africa called Mulwiyah, took refuge in Andalus with the remainder of the Syrian  troops ; some say in the year 123, others in 124. Balj made war upon “Abdu-l-  malek, whom he defeated and took prisoner, putting him to death in the month of  Dhi-l-ka’dah, 123 (Sept. or Oct. a. p. 741), ten months after his usurpation of the  power.

In that state did the body of the unfortunate ’Abdu-l-malek remain for a considerable  time, until some of his friends and clients stole his mangled remains one night, and  buried them. The spot where this lamentable execution took place was long  after known as Masslab Ibn Kattan, ‘the place of crucifixion of Ibn Kattan.’  A few years after this event, the government of Andalus having devolved on his  cousin, Yusuf Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmdn Al-fehri, Umeyyah, the son of the executed  governor, applied to him for permission to build a mosque on the spot ; and, having  obtained it, he erected a handsome temple, which was called Mesjid Umeyyah (the  mosque of Umeyyah), after the name of its founder; and thus did the spot lose  its former name. They say that when ’Abdu-l-malek was executed he was nearly  ninety years old; but of this more will be said when we come to treat about Balj.",57,book_5,

About this time, especially, elated at their past success, they aimed at taking  the empire from the hands of the Arabs. Thus it occurred: when the Khalif  Hishdm Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, who succeeded his brother Yezid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek in  the year 105 of the Hijra (beginning June 9, a. p. 723), received intelligence  of the revolt of the Berbers in Maghrebu-l-akssdé (Western Africa) and in Andalus,  and how they had shaken off the yoke of the Arabs, and denied all obedience to  him, resisting the authority of his officers, and committing all sorts of excesses and  depredations throughout the country, he was greatly displeased, and decreed the  immediate removal of ’Obeydullah Ibnu-l-hajdb, then governor of Africa. This  done, he appointed to succeed him Kolthtim Ibn ’Iy4dh Al-kusheyri, who left Syria  with a considerable army to make war upon the rebels.   With these forces, which, added to the African garrisons, amounted to no less  than seventy thousand men, Kolthtim took the field, and marched against the chief  of the insurrection, named Meysarah, a Berber, who had assumed the name and  authority of the Khalif in Africa. -When the two armies met, the Moslems were  defeated with great loss; and their general, Kolthim, being wounded, was on the  point of falling into the hands of his enemies. He, however, contrived to make  his escape,? and shut himself up in the castle of Ceuta. Among the Arabs who",58,book_5,
"    CHAP, V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 41    took refuge in that fortress was a nephew of Kolthiim, named Balj Ibn Beshr  Al-kusheyri.   When the news of this disaster reached Syria, Hisham was mightily displeased. eater   Wishing to wash out the injury which the Moslems had sustained, he dis- by Hondhaiah.  patched another army under the command of Hondhalah Ibn Sefwan Al-kelbi,  who, immediately after his arrival, attacked the Berbers, and defeated them in  several bloody encounters. But in the interval between the defeat of the Arabs  and the arrival of Hondhalah, Balj and his uncle Kolthim, with the relics of the  Syrian army,> were closely besieged in Ceuta by the Berbers. So effectually was  the city surrounded, and so vigorous were the attacks of the enemy, that the besieged  began to feel the scarcity of provisions, and were reduced to the greatest extremity.  In this conflict they sent to implore the assistance of their brethren, the Moslems  of Andalus; but ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Kattan, who was then governor of that  country, fearing lest, if he extricated them from their dangerous position, they  might afterwards disturb him, refused to grant them any assistance. However,  the news of their danger having become known throughout Andalus, there were  not wanting some generous and pious men who flew to their relief, or who sent  them stores and provisions. Zeyydd Ibn ’Amru Al-lakhmi,* among others, freighted  two vessels loaded with provisions, by means of which he actually saved them from  starvation. But no sooner was ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Kattan apprised of this act of  disobedience to his orders, than he caused Zeyyad to be immediately arrested and  brought to his presence, when, after reproaching him with his disobedience, he had  him punished with seven hundred lashes. Nor did Ibn Kattan’s vengeance end  here: some time after, under the pretence that he was trying to form in the army  a party against him, he ordered Zeyyad to be first deprived of his sight, and then  beheaded and crucified, having at his left hand a dog.   It so happened about this time that the Berbers of Andalus, having heard of the ie erereed  victories which their brethren of Africa had gained over the Arabs, shook off all agaiust the  allegiance to the Moslems of Andalus,* and imitated in every respect the example =~  of their countrymen. Having elected a chief of their own, they fought several  battles with the troops of ’Abdu-l-malek, whom they defeated on more than one mbeyiieeat ay  occasion. When Ibn Kattan saw this, he began to fear lest the Berbers should  entirely overpower his forces, and get possession of the country. Perceiving  therefore that the rebels, proud of the victories gained over his arms, intended to  march against him and besiege his capital, Cordova, he bethought himself of  calling to his aid Balj Ibn Beshr and the Syrian adventurers who followed his  banners; thinking that they would gladly embrace any opportunity to revenge  their past defeats on the Berbers of Andalus. He accordingly wrote to Balj,   VOL. 11. G",59,book_5,

They revolt  against him.    42 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v.    inviting him to come over, and promising great rewards to him and his troops in  case they should succeed in reducing the Berbers. When Balj received Ibn  Kattan’s letters, his uncle Kolthtim was just dead ; so that, seeing no hope of pro-  motion or advantage in Africa, and being moreover unable to extricate himself from  his perilous position, that chief readily accepted the offer made to him, and crossed  over to Andalus. On the arrival of his Syrian auxiliaries, Ibn Kattan failed not to  receive them with the greatest courtesy, making them extensive grants of land, and  conferring on them many other favours. It was, however, previously agreed  between the two parties, that as soon as their united forces had exterminated the  Berbers, Balj and his Syrians should return to Africa; in security for which they  were to give ’Abdu-l-malek a certain number of hostages. These conditions being  mutually agreed upon, the Syrians were divided into two corps, the command of  which was given by ’Abdu-l-malek to his two sons, Kattan and Umeyyah, who  marched immediately against the Berbers, who by that time had collected together  considerable forces. The two armies met soon afterwards, when, after a most  desperate and well contested battle, the wheel of fortune turned against the Berbers,  and they were defeated, notwithstanding their forces were so numerous as to render it  impossible for any but Allah, their Creator, to estimate their amount. The Arabs  pursued them with great slaughter through the provinces of Andalus, until their  fugitive remainsereached the extreme frontiers of the Mussulman empire, or  succeeded in hiding themselves from the eyes of the Syrian hawks.   In the mean while Balj and his followers were elated with success ; their nostrils  swelled with pride; their hands were filled with spoils; their strength and im-  portance waxed greater; their ambition was kindled; they broke the agreements  they had entered into, and forgot the conditions they had signed; and when Ibn  Kattan, agreeably to their engagements, requested them to leave Andalus, they  refused to do so, making all sorts of excuses to put off their departure. At last,  throwing off the mask of dissimulation, they began to complain bitterly of the  injuries received at the hands of Ibn Kattan, when, being besieged in Ceuta, he not  only would not give them any assistance, but had besides sentenced and put to  death, as related elsewhere, an Arab, who, in violation of his orders, had sent them  provisions and stores: they declared themselves in open rebellion, deposed Ibn  Kattan, and appointed in his stead their general, Balj Ibn Beshr. The new governor  was therefore acknowledged throughout the country; the troops, even those of Ibn  Kattan, having declared in his favour. After this, Balj was advised by his followers to    They take him put Ibn Kattan to death ;® but this he would not do, in consequence of which the    prisoner.    people of Yemen showed their discontent, and said to him: ‘‘ Thou wishest to spare  ‘Tbn Kattan because he belongs to the tribe of Modhar, and is therefore one of thy",60,book_5,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 43    “‘ kindred. By Allah! unless thou deliver him immediately into our hands, we  ‘swear not to obey thy commands.” Hearing which, and seeing his men de-  termined to have their revenge, Balj ordered the deposed governor into his presence,  and delivered him into the hands of the infuriated soldiery. The author whose  narrative we transcribe says, that ’Abdu-l-malek was a tall and muscular old man,  resembling a young ostrich ; he was then ninety years of age.”? When young, he  had been present at the famous battle of Al-harrah,® fought between the Syrians  and the people of Medinah. While the executioners were binding his hands,  one of them addressed him thus: ‘‘ We have thee at last; thou didst once  ‘escape from our swords at the battle of Al-hérrah ; after which thou doomedst  “‘ us to eat dogs and the skins of animals, and didst refuse us all supplies, that we  “ might all die in Ceuta from hunger and thirst ; but thou art now in our hands,  “ and revenge must have its course.” ’Abdu-l-malek was instantly beheaded, and  crucified in the manner above described.   By the death of ’Abdu-l-malek, the government of Andalus devolved on Balj  the Syrian, as above mentioned; but he had soon to contend against Kattan and  Umeyyah, the two sons of the deceased, who, assisted by the tribe of Fehr, and  by all the discontented, and many others who took offence at the execution of the  late governor, advanced towards Cordova at the head of a considerable army.  Balj went out to meet them, and gave them battle; but although fortune proved  favourable to his arms, and the Fehrites were defeated, he himself was mortally  wounded, and died soon after the action, in the year 124, one year or so after his  usurpation of the power. The particulars of this engagement are thus described by  a trustworthy historian :—‘‘ When Kattan and Umeyyah, the two sons of ’Abdu-l-  “‘ malek, heard of their father’s execution, they fled from Cordova, and, having  “collected together some forces, swore to revenge their father’s blood. They  “* were soon joined not only by all the Arabian tribes which had settled? in Andalus  ‘ previous to the arrival of the Syrians, and who were envious at their success,  “‘ but by the Berbers themselves, who from all parts of the country now flocked  ‘‘ under their standard. Among the former was ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Habib Ibn  “ Abi ’Obeydah Ibn ’Okbah Ibn Nafi’ Al-fehri,!° one of the generals of the army,  ‘“‘ who had hitherto followed the party of Balj; but who, seeing the barbarous  “ retaliation committed on his cousin ’Abdu-l-malek, deserted the banners of that  “ chief, and passed over to the enemy with a considerable body of troops. Their  “ranks were further increased by the arrival of ’Abdu-r-rahma4n Ibn ’Alkamah  “ Al-lakhmi, governor of Narbonne, the bravest knight in Andalus, who likewise  “‘ embraced their party: the combined forces of the rebels, amounting to upwards  “‘ of one hundred thousand men, then marched to besiege Balj in Cordova.

Their wars  with the  Berbers.    44 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v.    ‘« Syrian general, being an experienced and valiant warrior, was not taken un-  ‘“‘ awares: he went out to meet them at the head of twelve thousand cavalry,  “* without including in this number a large body of his own slaves, which he had  “formed into a division, and various tribes of the Beladi'' Arabs, who were  ‘“‘ ranged under his banners. When the two armies met, the Syrians fought with  ‘« desperate valour, performing feats of arms the like of which never before were  “ witnessed. In the midst of the engagement, however, Ibn ’Alkamah thus  “ addressed his followers: ‘Show me where Balj is, that I may look for him,  “ transfix him with this my spear, or, by Allah! die at his hands.’ Upon which one  ‘« of his borderers !? pointed out to him the spot where Balj was, and Ibn ’Alkamah  ‘‘made a desperate charge at the head of his own men. The Syrian knights,  ‘‘ unable to withstand the shock, gave way, and a passage was thus opened which  ‘enabled Ibn ’Alkamah to penetrate into the middle of their ranks. Having  ‘‘ reached the spot where Balj fought, he wounded him twice with his spear, and  ‘threw him off his saddle. Notwithstanding this mishap the Syrians fought so  “* well, that after some time the Beladi Arabs were completely routed and took to  “ flight, being closely pursued by the Syrians, who made great slaughter among  “them, and took many prisoners; victory thus remaining to those who had lost  “ their general in the action.”’* This battle, and the death of Balj, who, as we have  already observed, died of his wounds two days after,’* happened in the month of  Shawwal, a.u. 124 (Sept. a.p. 742), eleven months '® after his coming into power.  Like his predecessors, Balj held his court at Cordova.   After the death of their general, the Syrians appointed to succeed him Tha’lebah  Ibn Salamah Al-’ameli, by others called Al-jodhdmi;'® but before we proceed any  further, we think it important to observe that the Arabs who entered Andalus with  Balj were known by the name of Shdmitin (people of Shém or Syria), to distinguish  them from those who were already in that country, and came at the time of the  conquest or soon after it: these were called Beladiin. But to return; after  the death of Balj, as related, Tha’lebah Ibn Saldmah Al-’Ameli was appointed by the  Syrians to govern the country, in virtue of a provision received from the Khalif  Hisham to that effect. Tha’lebah ruled the country with great moderation and  justice. Ibnu Khaldtn says ‘that he governed it for a period of two years,  “ although his authority was not acknowledged for more than ten months;” his  partiality for the Yemeni Arabs having become the cause of the desertion of the  tribe of Fehr, and of the civil wars which ensued. It happened thus: soon  after the appointment of Tha’lebah, the first Andalusian settlers from among’ the  Arabs and the Berbers resolved upon revenging the outrages they had received at  the hands of the Syrians, and accordingly made war upon Tha’lebah, whom they",62,book_5,
"    cHapP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 45    besieged in Merida, where he had taken refuge. When the rebels saw Tha’lebah  shut up within the walls of that city, they were greatly rejoiced, and doubted not of  the victory: they thought that their enemy could not escape them, and would ere  long be obliged to give himself up for want of provisions. In this security, and  trusting in their numbers, the besiegers were scattered over the plain before Merida,  without the least order or vigilance. They even began to make preparations for  the solemnization of an approaching festival ;7 which being observed by Tha’lebah,  he chose the moment when they were most careless, and at sunrise of the day  in which they were to celebrate their festival, he made a sally at the head of his  garrison, and succeeded in routing them completely, killing great numbers of them ;  besides taking one thousand prisoners, with all their families’* and children. He  then returned to Cordova, where no less than ten thousand captives, or perhaps  more, taken by the different divisions of his army after the defeat before the walls  of Merida, were brought to him from various parts of the country. Tha’lebah  then encamped outside of Cordova with his troops. It was on a Thursday ; and on  the following day, after prayers, it was his intention to put the whole of his ten  thousand prisoners to the sword. Friday came on, and every one present expected  to see the massacre of the prisoners commence; when, lo! the Khalif’s banner  fluttered in the distance, and, soon after, Abii-l-khattar Husdm Ibn Dhirdr Al-kelbi,  who came to take possession of the government, made his- appearance.   Ibnu Khaldiin says that this Abi-l-khattar came to Andalus by the appointment {reo a:.  of Hondhalah Ibn Sefwdn, Wali of Africa, with instructions to re-establish public  order, and appease the troubles excited by the contending parties. He sailed from  the port of Tiinis in the month of Moharram of the year 125 (Nov. a.p. 742).  Ibnu Hayyén has words to the same effect, and adds that the reigning Khalif at the  time was Al-walid Ibn Yezid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn Merwdn: he places the arrival  of Abt-l-khattér in Cordova in Rejeb, 125 (May, 743), after Tha’lebah had  governed the country for ten months.   “No sooner,” continues Ibnu Khaldiin, ‘ did Abd-l-khattér land in Andalus  ‘‘ than all parties hastened to put down their arms. Tha’lebah himself, Ibn Abi  ‘* Nes’ah,!® and the two sons of ’Abdu-l-malek, went out to meet him, and swore  “allegiance. Abi-l-khattdr treated them all kindly; and Tha’lebah, the late  “‘ governor, returned to the East, where he attached himself to Merwdn Ibn  “’Mohammed, whom he followed in most of his campaigns.” ”   Abd-l-khattér is generally described as a brave and generous man, and en-  dowed with much prudence and great talents for administration. Finding that the  settlers from Syria were very numerous in Andalus, and that Cordova could no  longer hold them, he scattered them over the country, and gave them lands to",63,book_5,

He gave Elvira and the surrounding country to the people of Damascus,  who, finding it resemble their native country, called it Shém (Damascus): the  people of Hems (Emessa) he caused to settle at Seville, which received also the  name of Hems. Jayyen (Jaen) was given up to the people of Kenesrin, and called  also by that name, Kenesrin ; the people of Al-urddn had as their share Rayah and  Malaga, both of which they named Al-urdén; Shidhinah, or by others named  Sherish (Xerez), fell to the lot of the people of Palestine, and was therefore called  Filistin. The Egyptians had Tudmir, which, in imitation of the other settlers, they  called Misr ;# and lastly, the people of Wasit received Cabra and the neighbouring  districts as their share.   According to Ibnu Hayydn, Abi-l-khattar was an excellent poet: he also evinced  great talents for administration, and his government at first was just and mild, though  he afterwards showed some inclination to favour the Yemeni Arabs in their feuds  against the Modharites, and affronted the tribe of Kays, which is a branch of the  latter ; the consequence of which was that civil war”? broke out afresh, and raged  with more violence than ever. The cause of the war is thus related by the histo-  rians: Abi-I-khattéar had always shown himself partial to the Arabs of Yemen.  One day a man belonging to his own tribe had an altercation with a man of the  tribe of Kendnah, and although the case was clearly proved against the Yemenf,  who was a cousin of Abi-l-khattér, the governor, swayed by love for his own  people,* decided in favour of his cousin. The Kendni then went to see As-samil  Ibn Hatim Ibn Shamr Al-kelabi, surnamed Abi-l-jaushan, and told him of Abi-l-  khattdr’s injustice. Now this As-samil was one of the principal chiefs™ of the  Beni Modhar ; he hated tyranny and oppression, and could not suppress his in-  dignation when he heard of the outrage inflicted on one of his own people, whose  rights he was always the first to defend and support. He goes immediately to see  Abi-l-khattér, and reproaches him with his conduct in language not very moderate ;  upon which Abi-l-khattér answers with abuse: As-samil replies, and things go so  far that Abd-l-khattar orders his guards to seize him, raise him from his seat, and  put him out of the room.” They relate that in the scuffle As-samil received some  blows in the nape of his neck, by which his turban was thrown on one side ; and  that as he was going out of the Amir’s palace a man who was standing at the door  said to him, ‘‘ O Abi-l-jaushan, what is the matter with thy turban? By Allah!  “it is all on one side.”—‘‘ Thou art right, man,” said As-samil, ‘‘ but I trust  “‘my people will soon put it right for me.” Saying which, he immediately  retired to his dwelling, and sent for his friends and clients, who came to him in  haste as soon as they heard of the occurrence. When they were all assembled,  As-samil begged them to stay with him; and when the shades of night had",64,book_5,

I have been injured and ill-treated by the  “ Amir; but the affront is not one that falls only on me, it comprises you all as  “‘ my friends and relatives.” He then told them his adventure with Abi-l-khattér ;  upon which his friends replied, ‘‘ If thou declare unto us what kind of revenge  ‘it is thy intention to take, we will see whether we can participate in thy designs,  ‘“‘ or not.”—‘ By Allah!” said As-samil, “ my vengeance shall not be satisfied  ‘“‘ with any thing short of taking the command from the hands of this Arab: in  “order to accomplish which, I intend to quit Cordova secretly this very night,  “‘and betake myself where I can expect help and security; for I see at present  “‘ no other way of carrying my plans into execution. Whither do ye think I had  “better go? To whom shall I apply for aid? ’”—‘‘ Go wherever thou likest,”  said his friends, ‘‘ provided it be not to the dwelling of Abi ’Atté Al-kaysi; for he  “is incapable of lending thee any assistance, and will never do any thing that  “* may turn to thy advantage.” This Abi ’Atta was an Arabian chief, who enjoyed  great authority and power in the city of Ezija, the place of his residence: he was  a great enemy of As-samil, and his rival in every thing. All those present at this  interview assented to this advice, except Abi Bekr Ibn Tofayl Al-’abadi, who,  although still a youth, enjoyed great consideration and respect in the tribe: he  alone refused to give his opinion, and kept silence; which being observed by  As-samil, he addressed him thus:—‘‘ Why dost thou not speak, O Ibn Tofayl?  ‘“* What is thy advice?”—‘‘ I have only one thing to say,” replied the youth,  ‘“‘ which is, that if thou do not go to see Abi ’Attd, and persist in thy enmity to  ‘him, this our conspiracy will certainly not succeed, and we shall all of us meet  “with our death. If, on the contrary, thou go to see him, I am sure he will  “‘ forget what has passed between you; he will be moved by love to thee and  ‘his tribe, and he will do any thing thou wishest him to do.”—‘* Well said!”  replied As-samil; ‘‘ thine is the best advice, and I will certainly act upon it.”  He accordingly left Cordova that very night, and repaired to Ezija, where he  visited Abi ’Atta, who, being a generous and forgiving man, immediately tendered  him such aid to his cause as he could bestow. From Ezija As-samil went to  Mirir (Moror),% the place of residence of Thudbah [Ibn Salamah] Ibn Yezid”  Al-jodhdmi, one of the principal chiefs of the Yemeni Arabs, who, having also  received certain injuries at the hands of Abi-l-khattar, readily consented to assist  As-samil in his undertaking, and agreed, when called upon, to take the field with  the Beni Modhar. Having therefore fixed upon Shidhtinah (Sidonia) as the place  of their meeting, the rebels mustered their forces, and marched against Abt-I- 1, defeated  khattér, whom they defeated with great slaughter on the banks of the Wada-Leke,?¢ 2""¢ taken    prisoner.",65,book_5,

They say that when As-samil and Thudbah saw that governor  in their power, their first intention was to put him to death; but they delayed  his execution, and took him in irons to Cordova, where he was confined to a strong  tower in the walls. All this happened in the month of Rejeb of the year 127  (April or May, a. p. 745), two years after Abi-l-khattéar had taken possession of  the government of Andalus.   Abi-l-khattar, however, did not remain long in confinement, having soon after  succeeded in making his escape, with the assistance of his friends. Abu-l-khattdr’s  liberation happened thus: A friend of his, named ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ibn Hossdn  Al-kelbi,2” came to Cordova one night, accompanied by thirty horsemen and a  small body of infantry, all men of tried courage, and in whose experience and  fidelity he could trust. Having made a sudden attack upon the tower where  Abi-l-khattar was detained, they massacred the guards, and liberated the deposed  governor, who retired with them to the western provinces.   No sooner did the news of Abi-l-khattdr’s liberation, and his readiness to assert  his rights, spread over the country, than he was joined by the Yemeni Arabs, who  from all sides flocked under his banners ; and he was thus enabled to resume the  offensive, and march upon Cordova. Thudbah in the mean time was not inactive.  Having assembled his forces, he went out to meet him in company with As-samil.  The two hosts were in presence of each other, and ready to commence the engage-  ment, when an Arab of the tribe of Modhar rose by night (and placing himself within  hearing of Abi-l-khattar’s followers), began crying out at the top of his voice,—‘‘ O  “« Arabs of Yemen! why expose yourselves to the fortunes of war? and why try  “to avert the fate which awaits Abi-l-khattdér? Has he not been already in our  “‘ power, and at our discretion? Nay, had we chosen to put him to death, we  “‘ might easily have accomplished it ; but we had pity on him, and we spared his  “life. The governor appointed by us belongs also to your tribe. Why do you  “not think of your situation? If Thuabah belonged to any other tribe but your  “ own, you might have an excuse in your rising ; but as it is, you have none. And  ‘“« do not imagine that these sentiments are uttered through a wish on our part to  “« conciliate you, or through fear of your spears; it is only our love of peace, and  “ our anxiety to stop the effusion of blood, and to promote the welfare of the people  “of this country in general, which dictate them.” These words had the desired  effect. They were listened to with attention by the followers of Abd-l-khattar,  who said, ‘‘ By Allah! that man is right.” And accordingly they marched away  that very night, and on the morning of the next day they were some miles from the  field of battle.   Tbnu Bashkiwal says that when the Modharites and their chiefs had agreed upon",66,book_5,

This happened towards the end of the month Africa.   of Rejeb of the year 127 (April, a.p. 745), when the country was in some   manner pacified, all the power being concentrated in the hands of Thudbah, or   rather of As-samil, who was his second in command. Thudbah governed Andalus   for a year or so, after which time he died.*! In the work of Ibnu-l-faradhi, how-   ever, the government of Thuabah is said to have lasted two years.   The same writer (Abi-l-walid Ibnu-l-faradhi) describes Abi-l-khattér as a noble  and high-minded man; only that, being descended from a tribe of Yemen, he  showed too great a partiality to the people of his kindred, and was ill-disposed  towards the Beni Modhar. He affronted the tribe of Kays: this being the cause of  the rising of their chief, As-samil, who deposed him, and appointed in his room  Thudbah Ibn Saldmah, as elsewhere related. Ibnu-l-faradhi adds, that the two  factions continued after this to wage war against one another; that Abi-l-khattdr  was deposed four years and nine months* after his taking possession of the  government, in the year 128 (beginning Oct. 2, a.p. 745), and that he was at last  put to death by As-samil, and replaced by Thuabah Ibn Saldmah in the government  of Andalus. But to return.   Tbnu Khaldiin says, ‘‘ About this time civil war raged in Africa, and the empire  “of the Beni Umeyyah began to decay in the East. The Khalifs of that dynasty  ‘* were assailed by rebels in every distant province, and the power and importance  “‘ of the wearers of the black colours (’Abbdsides) waxed every day greater. In  ‘the mean time the people of Andalus were left to themselves, and without a  “ruler. At first the administration was carried on in the name of ’Abdu-r-rahman  “ Tbn Kethir ; ** but afterwards the army decided upon dividing the empire between  “the two rival factions, the Beni Modhar and the Arabs of Yemen, in such a  “manner that each party should govern the country for one year, when they  “ would resign the command into the hands of the other. The Beni Modhar,  ‘« who were to be the first, appointed, in the year 129, as their commander, Yusuf  “ Tbn ’Abdi-r-rahman Al-fehri, who accordingly governed the country for one year,  ‘‘ taking up his residence at Cordova. But when, after the expiration of that  “ year, the Yemenis sought to be put in possession of the government, according  “to the agreement entered into with the opposite party, Yusuf, accompanied by  “ As-samil Ibn Hatim and the tribe of Kays, and all the other tribes issued  “from the stock of Modhar, made one night a sudden attack upon Shekundah,  ‘a village close to Cordova,** where the Yemenis had taken up their abode, and  “‘ massacred the greater part of them.

Ibnu Hayyén relates these events differently: he says, ‘‘ When Abi-l-khattér  “ heard of his [Ytsuf’s] appointment, he put his Yemenis into requisition ; and all  “answered his call, this being the cause of the celebrated battle of Shekundah,  “fought between the Beni Modhar and the Arabs of Yemen. They say that   Poe ‘there never was, either in the East or the West, a more bloody and contested  ‘“‘ battle than that of Shekundah, nor one in which greater feats of arms were  ‘‘ performed by the warriors on both sides, who fought until the edges of their  “‘ swords were softened by the blows, when each man seized his adversary by the  “hair, and fought with his hands until they fell down exhausted and tired of  “‘ dealing and receiving blows. However, it appears that As-samil, having upon  “a certain day received intelligence that his enemies were not upon their guard,  “ called together all the tradespeople and shopkeepers * of Cordova, and, putting  ‘himself at their head, resolved to make a sudden attack upon the Yemenis.  ‘* Having selected four hundred of the most determined and bravest among them,  “armed with knives, sticks, and such other weapons as they could procure,—a  “‘ few only being provided with either spears or swords,—he led them against the  “‘ Yemenis, who, being unprepared for the attack, were seized with a sudden panic,  “ and fled in every direction before the people of Cordova, without returning their  “blows, or attempting even to parry those dealt to them.** They were hotly  ‘“‘ pursued by the enemy, who made great slaughter in their ranks. So great was  *¢ the loss which the Yemenis sustained on this memorable occasion, that but few   Death of Abu- “* of their number outlived the bloody encounter. Abu-l-khattér, among others,  “* fled the field of battle, and took refuge in a neighbouring mill, where he remained  “for some time concealed under the mill-stone:°”7 he was, however, detected  “and brought to the presence of As-samil, who had him immediately beheaded.”  The above is borrowed from the work of Ibnu Hayyan.   The grandsons The historians of Andalus have recounted at length some transactions in which  the grandsons of King Wittiza were concerned, during the administration of Abi-l-  khattar. After the death of Almond, who was the eldest son of that monarch,  and who, as related,** left a daughter called Sérah, and two sons in tender age,  Artabdsh seized the states of his nephews, and appropriated them to himself. This  happened at the beginning of the Khalifate of Hisham Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek. When  Sdrah, the Goth, saw herself and brothers thus deprived of their father’s inheritance,  she laid a complaint before Abi-l-khattdér ; but seeing that justice was not speedily  done to her, she determined upon repairing to the East in person, and getting  redress from the Khalif. Accordingly, having fitted out a good vessel, and provided",68,book_5,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 51    it with the necessary stores for the voyage, she embarked at Seville with her two  brothers, and set sail for Syria. Having landed at ’Askaltin (Ascalon), a sea-port  on the shores of that country, Sarah proceeded to Damascus, where the Khalif  Hish4m Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek held his court. After informing that Sultan of her case,  she implored justice against her uncle, and begged him to issue orders to Abi-l-  khattdr to re-instate her and her brothers in all the lands belonging to their father,  as contained in the capitulation entered into with Tdrik, and confirmed by his  predecessor, the Khalif Al-walid. Hisham was much pleased with Sdrah, whose  courage and determination he greatly admired: he treated her kindly, and admitted  her to his privacy ; and when she expressed her wish to depart, gave her a letter  for Hondhalah Ibn Sefwan Al-kelbi, his governor of Eastern Africa, intrusting him  with the redress of the injury she had sustained at the hands of her uncle Artabash,  and bidding him to have restored to her and her brothers all those states which,  in conformity with the laws of succession, might belong to them as their father’s  inheritance. Hondhalah did as he was commanded : he gave Sérah a letter for his  lieutenant in Andalus (Abi-l-khattar), who, on receipt of it, put her and her brothers  in full possession of all their rights.   According to other authorities, before Sarah quitted Syria, Hish4m gave her  in marriage to a noble Arab, named ""Isa Ibn Ibrahim, who dwelt with her at  Damascus for some time, but who, on the return of Sarah to Andalus, accompanied  her to that country, where he soon after recovered from her uncle Artab4sh the  possession of all her states, through which he was enabled to live in great affluence  and comfort. ’Isa had by her two sons, one named Ibrahim, the other Is’hak,  both of whom held offices of trust at Seville, the place of their residence, and were  very much esteemed and respected on account of their descent on the mother’s side  from the Gothic kings of Andalus.   They relate likewise, that whilst Sérah was staying at the court of Hisham, she  met in one of her visits to that Khalif his grandson ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Mu’dwiyah,  the same who in after-time became the master of Andalus, and that to this circum-  stance she owed the great favour which she always enjoyed with that monarch ;  for when ’Abdu-r-rahmadn had conquered the whole of Andalus, S4rah hastened to  Cordova to compliment him on his good success, and she failed not to recall herself  to his memory, and recommend herself to his good graces as a Christian living  in his dominions. ’Abdu-r-rahman then recollected her, and granted her the  privilege of entering at all hours the royal palace whenever she went to Cordova.  In this manner he continued bestowing on her new honours and distinctions, going  so far as to grant her leave to visit his harem and see his wives and daughters  without their veils on.

"    Liberality of  Artabash.    52 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v.    which ’Abdu-r-rahmén arrived in Andalus (a.H. 138), Sérah married ’Abdu-r-  rahman Ibn ’Omayr Ibn Sa’id.   Many truly royal acts have been recorded of this princess, as well as of her  father Almond, and of her uncle Artabash, living, as they did, under the Arabian  Amirs, who at that time governed Andalus. The following anecdote, related by the  theologian Mohammed Ibn ’Omar Ibn Lebbdnah,®® is one: ‘‘ Ten of the principal  “ Arab chieftains, amongst whom were As-samil, Ibnu-t-tofayl,“° Abi ’Abdah, and  other noble Syrians, came once to visit Artabésh, who received them with the  greatest attention, and caused them to sit down on the cushions surrounding  his hall. Soon after, a pious man named Maymin,*! the progenitor of the Beni  Hazm, and who, though a Syrian too, did not associate much with them, on  account of his very pious and abstemious habits, entered the room ; and no sooner  did Artabish see him than he got up to receive him (this being an honour which  he had not done to the rest of his guests), and bidding him ascend a gilded couch  upon which he was reclining, made him a sign to sit in his own place. This  favour, however, Maymiin most obstinately refused, and, notwithstanding the  entreaties of Artabaésh, he sat himself on the floor; seeing which, the prince did  the same, and sat alongside of Maymin, turning his face towards him, and his  back to the company. ‘O Artabdsh,’ inquired Maymtn in amazement, ‘ what  makes thee treat one like me in this way?’ Artabash then said, ‘ hast thou not  heard *? that we came to this country as enemies? and therefore never thought  that our residence would be a long one; we were not in any way prepared to  stay, and had not a large stock of provisions with us. After we are dead, thou  ‘ mayest tell our maulis how we despaired of ever returning to our native places.’  Maymiin then replied, ‘God has given thee plenty of fortune’s gifts, and I  wish thee to let me have one of thy farms, that I may cultivate the land with  my own hands, and make over the produce of it to thee, after deducting the  sum required for my maintenance.’—‘I will with great pleasure,’ answered  Artabash ; ‘ but, instead of a farm in which thou wilt have only a small interest, I  shall give thee the entire possession of it.’ He then sent for the chief of his  “household, and addressed him thus: ‘Thou shalt deliver into the hands of  Maymtn our farm so and so, on the banks of the river Shtis,** with all the  slaves, beasts, and cattle appertaining to it; and thou shalt besides put him in  “‘ possession of our estate in Jaen.’ These orders being readily complied with,  ‘‘ Maymin became the owner of extensive property, in which he was succeeded by  “his son. To them owes its name a fortress in that territory called Kal’ah-  “ Hazm.” The authors who have recorded this anecdote add, ‘‘ that no sooner  “had Maymin, after returning due thanks for so signal a favour, taken leave of",70,book_5,

As to thyself,  “« (may God Almighty prosper thee!) thou hast already sufficient honour, since  ‘“* men regard thee on account of thy dignity and thy power, whilst this poor man  “has no one else to protect and favour him but God. We have been told of  “a saying of the Messiah, (peace be on Him!) who said once to his people, ‘ He  “who has been honoured in this world by other men being made subservient to’  “him, his honour agrees with his nature, as if he swallowed a stone.’ As-samil was  ‘an illiterate man, and hence the allusion made by Artabdsh in his reply. After  “this, As-samil’s friends spoke to him thus: ‘ Enough of this; let us drop the  ‘‘ unprofitable question, and proceed to business by stating the object of our visit.’  “« They then told Artabésh, ‘ We want precisely the same thing thou hast granted  “this man; and since thou hast been so generous with one so low, we are curious  “ to see how thou wilt deal with us who are the principal men of the land.’-—‘ You  ‘are right,’ answered Artabdsh ; ‘ he was only a subject, whilst you all are princes  “and lords; you will not therefore like to receive from me but what is great and  “handsome: I give you one hundred farms, to be equally divided among you, ten  “to each.’ He then sent for the chief of his household, and having issued the  “‘ necessary orders in writing, As-samil and his friends were immediately put in  ‘ possession of their respective estates, which were the best possessed by Artabash.”  But to resume the thread of our narrative.   Thudbah was succeeded by Ydsuf Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Ibn Habib Ibn Abi  ’Obeydah Ibn ’Okbah Ibn Naf’ Al-fehri, who was the descendant of [’Okbah]  the governor of Eastern Africa, and the founder of Cairwin, he of the praise-  worthy deeds and glorious conquests, whose memory shall for ever live, the  stock of a family which obtained no small share of power both in Africa and  in Andalus. According to the historian Ar-rizi, Yusuf Al-fehri was born in the desi plied  city of Cairwdn, whence his father, ’Abdu-r-rahman, crossed over to Andalus, by the army.  together with [his grandfather] Habib Ibn Abi ’Obeydah Al-fehri, at the time of  the conquest of that country. ’Abdu-r-rahmin returned to Eastern Africa; but",71,book_5,
"    Several chiefs  resist his au-  thority.    Ne defeats  them in  succession,    54 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v.    his son Yusuf, having quarrelled with him, fled to Andalus, wherein he settled  and obtained command. The same writer (Ar-rdzi) relates, that on the day on  which Yusuf took possession of the government he was fifty-seven years of age,  and that he was elected to that office by the army and the people, after the death  of Thudbah, and when the country had been four months without a ruler. He  owed his appointment to the suggestions of As-samil, who recommended him on  account of his being a Korayshite; which circumstance, that chief thought, might  lead, if not to the entire reconciliation of the rival tribes, at least to a suspension  of hostilities. So it happened: both parties put down their arms, and acknow-  ledged the authority of Yiisuf, who was thereby enabled to carry on the government  for a period of nine years and nine months.“   Ibnu Hayyan relates that Yusuf’s appointment took place in the month of Rabi’-1-  akhar of the year 129 (Dec. 746, or Jan. 747) ; that he ruled as master in Andalus  without acknowledging any superior, since his nomination did not in any way  emanate from the Khalif, but merely from the troops.   Yiisuf’s government was by no means a tranquil one, as he had to contend with  several chiefs, who on various occasions took the field against him, and aimed at  depriving him both of life and power. He was however successful, and vanquished  all his enemies, until he himself was overpowered and put to death by ’Abdu-r-  rahman Ad-dakhel, of the royal family of Umeyyah, as we shall presently relate.   Among the chiefs who disputed with Yisuf the government of Andalus, Ibnu  Hayy4n counts ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn ’Alkamah Al-lakhmi, governor of Narbonne,  a fortress on the frontiers of the land of the Franks, whose undaunted courage,  great corporal strength, and splendid feats of arms, became proverbial in Andalus,  and won him the surname of Al-fdrisu-l-andalus (the Knight of Andalus). This  ’Abdu-r-rahman had, on a former occasion, assisted the sons of ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn  Kattan in their revolt against Balj Ibn Beshr, and it was he who dealt this chief  the blow from which he died a few days after the battle. However, as ’Abdu-r-  rahman was preparing to attack Yvisuf, he was treacherously put to death by his  own men, who hastened to convey his head to his enemy.   ’Orwah Ibnu-l-walid was the next chieftain who took up arms against Yisuf.  Assisted by the Christians and others, he raised the standard of revolt in the city of  Beja, whence he marched upon Seville, which place he also reduced. His forces  increasing by the arrival of numerous adventurers, who from all parts of the  country flocked under his banners, Yusuf marched in person against him, and put  him to death.   ’A’mir Al-’abdari * rose likewise at Algesiras, but without better success. Yusuf  marched against him, and made him lay down his arms on condition that he should",72,book_5,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 55    reside at Cordova. After which, however, he had him beheaded, in the year 138  (beginning June 15, 755), as will be related hereafter.   *Amru Ibn Yezid Al-azrak * is another of the Arabian chiefs who revolted against  Ytisuf. Some say that he was the first who resisted his authority, and that he rose  at Seville, but was vanquished and put to death.   Besides the above rebellions, Yiisuf had to quell that of Al-habab‘? Az-zahri,  an Arabian chieftain, who, on hearing of the victories which the Beni ’Abbds had  obtained in the East over their enemies of the house of Umeyyah, appeared in arms  against Yusuf, and proclaimed the Khalifs of the house of ’Abbds as sovereigns of  Andalus. Having collected a numerous host, he laid siege to Saragossa, where  As-samil commanded in Ytsuf’s name. That chief defended himself for a while,  but, seeing he could not hold much longer, sent to Yuisuf for aid. This, however,  Ytisuf would not grant, as he was angry with As-samil at the time, and wished  for his destruction. At last the tribe of Kays ran to the assistance of their chief,  and, having compelled Al-habab to raise the siege, extricated As-samil from his  dangerous position. Al-habab then returned, and gained possession of Saragossa ;  but, some time after, Yusuf marched in person against him and put him to death.   Ytisuf was the last governor of Andalus ; for, in the year 138 (beginning June 15,  755), ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Mu’dwiyah, a scion of the illustrious house of Umeyyah,  which had been in possession of the Khalifate for a period of nearly ninety years,  arrived in Andalus, where, with the assistance of the numerous partisans and  adherents of his family, he was enabled to contend successfully against him, and  to found a durable empire for his posterity. But, as it is our intention to relate  in detail the events which led to this mighty revolution, we need not further allude  to them here, and will now give the chronology of the Governors of Andalus.   Tarik was the first governor of Andalus ; then came Misa Ibn Nosseyr: neither aes  of them, however, fixed his residence in that country. Then came ’Abdu-l-’aziz, of Andalus.  son of Miisa, who held his court at Seville, where he was murdered. After him  Aytib Ibn Habib Al-lakhmi, who transferred the seat of the government to Cordova.  After him all the Governors or Sultans of Andalus held their court at that city,  or at Az-zahra, as is well known and we shall hereafter relate, until the dynasty  of the Beni Merwén was finally overthrown. Then came Al-horr Ibn ’Abdi-r-  rahman Ath-thakefi; then As-samh Ibn Malik Al-khauldni; then ’Abdu-r-rahman  Ibn ’Abdillah Al-ghéfeki; then ’Anbasah Ibn Sohaym Al-kelbi; then ’Ozrah Ibn  *Abdillah Al-fehri; then Yahya Ibn Salmah Al-kelbi; then ""Othman Ibn Abi  Nes’ah Al-khath’ami; then Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Al-ashjai; then ’Abdu-l-  malek Ibn Kattan Al-fehri; then Balj Ibn Beshr Ibn ’Iyddh Al-kusheyri; then  Tha’lebah Ibn Saldmah Al-jodhémi; then Thudbah Ibn Salamah Al-jodhami; then",73,book_5,

These are the governors who ruled over  Andalus without transmitting the command as an inheritance to their posterity, or  assuming any other title but that of Amir (Governor). They swayed the country  for a period of forty-six years, two. months and six days, counting from the day  on which Roderic the Goth, King of Andalus, was defeated and killed, that is to  say, on Sunday, the 5th of Shawwal of the year 92 (July 26, a.p. 711), to that  on which the Governor Yusuf Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman was defeated, and. his rival,  *Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Mu’dwiyah, of the royal house of Umeyyah, gained possession  of the empire, and made his triumphant entry into Cordova, namely, on the day of  ‘idu-l-adhdhi (festivity of the victims), or the tenth of Dhi-l-hajjah of the year 138  (May 15, a.p. 756).   All these Amirs (Governors) were appointed either by the Governors of Africa,  of which Andalus was then a dependency, or by the Khalifs of the house of Merwan  (the Beni Umeyyah), who ruled in the East, and were the sole Imams of the  Moslems, until the civil war was kindled, and their mighty dynasty, which had  lasted for a period of one thousand months, was overthrown by the Beni ’Abbds,  who succeeded them in the empire, and scattered them like dust before the wind.   In course of time, however, Andalus shook off the yoke of the Beni ’Abbds ; for  *Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Mu’dwiyah Ibn Hisham Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn Merwan, after  surmounting all manner of dangers, wrested that country from them, and made  it the seat of a powerful empire for himself and his sons, collecting round hinr the  relics of his family, and surrounding himself with the freedmen and adherents of  his ancestors: in short, the whole of Andalus submitted to him, and, after his death,  to his posterity, who held the supreme power there for a long space of time; God  Almighty being pleased to grant him victory over his enemies, the Beni ’Abbds,  who, wishing to regain possession of Andalus, and to extirpate all the members  of the rival house, frequently sent armies to invade that country, or instigated the  chiefs of the Arabian tribes there to take up arms against ’Abdu-r-rahman, and to  proclaim the supremacy of their own family. But all their attempts proved  unsuccessful ; for that Sultan defeated one after the other all those who were in arms  against him, and put numbers of them to the sword, principally during the Khalifate  of Abé Ja’far Al-manstir, as we shall relate more at large when we come to treat of  the establishment of the house of Umeyyah in Andalus.   We have now given in the preceding pages the cream .of the information to be  found in the work of Ibnu Khaldiin, as collected or compiled from various historical  sources.

We must also inform our  readers that the above extracts on the history of Andalus, from its conquest by  Térik Ibn Zeyad to the arrival of ’Abdu-r-rahman, are chiefly taken from the works  of Ibnu Hayydén and Ibnu Khaldin, two celebrated historians, who had access to  the best sources of information: the former author especially, who, in his two  historical works, the Matin and the Muktabis, preserved almost every tradition  current in his time on the events here recorded, mentions a long poem, which an  Andalusian writer, named Yahya Ibn Hakem Al-ghazz4l, wrote in the species of  metre called rejdz, wherein he describes most minutely the causes of the invasion  of Andalus ; the chief battles therein fought between the Moslems and the Goths ;  and lastly, the number and the names of the Amirs who administered the affairs  of that country until the arrival of ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Mu’dwiyah ;—“ a work,”  observes Ibnu Hayyan, “ exceedingly instructive and useful, and which may be  “« found in the hands of most people.”   We shall now proceed, with the help of God, to relate the events which led to  the establishment of the family of Merw4n or Beni Umeyyah in Andalus.

His adventures are thus related by  the historian Ibnu Hayyén in his Muktabis :  “« When the empire of the Beni Umeyyah was overthrown in the East, and the",76,book_6,

The following account of his adventures   “ whilst flying from his enemies has been handed down to us as related by ’Abdu-r-   ‘‘ rahman himself: ‘ As I was on a certain day sitting under cover of my tent, to   ‘‘ shelter myself from the rain, which fell heavily, and watching my eldest son   “« Suleymd4n, then about four years old, who was playing in front of it, I saw him Is pursued by  ‘* suddenly enter the door, crying violently ; and, soon after, he ran towards me, and of As-seffah.  ‘* clung to my bosom for protection. Not knowing what he meant, I pushed him   “‘ away; but the child clung still more to me, as one seized with violent fear, and   “* began uttering such exclamations as children are wont to utter when they are   “ frightened. I then left the tent, that I might see what caused his fear; when lo!   “‘T saw the whole village in confusion, and the inhabitants running to and fro   ‘‘in great consternation. I went a little further on, and saw the black banners   “« [of the ’Abbassides] fluttering in the wind. At sight of these a younger brother   ‘‘ of mine, who had also rushed out of the tent, and was with me at the time,   ‘* began to fly at the top of his speed, saying, ‘ Away! away with thee, O brother !   “ for yonder black banners are the banners of the sons of ’Abbds.’ Hearing this,   “J hastily grasped some dinars which I had just at hand, and fled precipitately out   “« of the village with my child and my younger brother, taking care to apprise my   ‘« sisters of my departure, and of the road we intended to take; and bidding them   “join us at a spot which I named, together with my freedman Bedr, who was the   “‘ bearer of my message. In this manner we escaped from our pursuers, and halted   ‘at a spot some distance from the village.

About this time, especially, elated at their past success, they aimed at taking  the empire from the hands of the Arabs. Thus it occurred: when the Khalif  Hishdm Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, who succeeded his brother Yezid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek in  the year 105 of the Hijra (beginning June 9, a. p. 723), received intelligence  of the revolt of the Berbers in Maghrebu-l-akssé (Western Africa) and in Andalus,  and how they had shaken off the yoke of the Arabs, and denied all obedience to  him, resisting the authority of his officers, and committing all sorts of excesses and  depredations throughout the country, he was greatly displeased, and decreed the  immediate removal of ’Obeydullah Ibnu-l-haj4b, then governor of Africa. This  done, he appointed to succeed him Kolthtim Ibn ’Iy4dh Al-kusheyri, who left Syria  with a considerable army to make war upon the rebels.   With these forces, which, added to the African garrisons, amounted to no less  than seventy thousand men, Kolthtim took the field, and marched against the chief  of the insurrection, named Meysarah, a Berber, who had assumed the name and  authority of the Khalif in Africa. -When the two armies met, the Moslems were  defeated with great loss; and their general, Kolthtim, being wounded, was on the  point of falling into the hands of his enemies. He, however, contrived to make  his escape,” and shut himself up in the castle of Ceuta. Among the Arabs who",78,book_6,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 41    took refuge in that fortress was a nephew of Kolthim, named Balj Ibn Beshr  Al-kusheyri.   When the news of this disaster reached Syria, Hisham was mightily displeased. parece   Wishing to wash out the injury which the Moslems had sustained, he dis- by Hondhalah.  patched another army under the command of Hondhalah Ibn Sefwan Al-kelbi,  who, immediately after his arrival, attacked the Berbers, and defeated them in  several bloody encounters. But in the interval between the defeat of the Arabs  and the arrival of Hondhalah, Balj and his uncle Kolthtim, with the relics of the  Syrian army,?: were closely besieged in Ceuta by the Berbers. So effectually was  the city surrounded, and so vigorous were the attacks of the enemy, that the besieged  began to feel the scarcity of provisions, and were reduced to the greatest extremity.  In this conflict they sent to implore the assistance of their brethren, the Moslems  of Andalus; but ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Kattan, who was then governor of that  country, fearing lest, if he extricated them from their dangerous position, they  might afterwards disturb him, refused to grant them any assistance. However,  the news of their danger having become known throughout Andalus, there were  not wanting some generous and pious men who flew to their relief, or who sent  them stores and provisions. Zeyydd Ibn ’Amru Al-lakhmi,* among others, freighted  two vessels loaded with provisions, by means of which he actually saved them from  starvation. But no sooner was ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Kattan apprised of this act of  disobedience to his orders, than he caused Zeyydd to be immediately arrested and  brought to his presence, when, after reproaching him with his disobedience, he had  him punished with seven hundred lashes. Nor did Ibn Kattan’s vengeance end  here: some time after, under the pretence that he was trying to form in the army  a party against him, he ordered Zeyydd to be first deprived of his sight, and then  beheaded and crucified, having at his left hand a dog.   It so happened about this time that the Berbers of Andalus, having heard of the The Berbers of    Andalus rise    victories which their brethren of Africa had gained over the Arabs, shook off all against the  .

Having elected a chief of their own, they fought several   battles with the troops of ’Abdu-l-malek, whom they defeated on more than one They defeat  occasion. When Ibn Kattan saw this, he began to fear lest the Berbers should  entirely overpower his forces, and get possession of the country. Perceiving  therefore that the rebels, proud of the victories gained over his arms, intended to   march against him and besiege his capital, Cordova, he bethought himself of  calling to his aid Balj Ibn Beshr and the Syrian adventurers who followed his  banners; thinking that they would gladly embrace any opportunity to revenge   their past defeats on the Berbers of Andalus. He accordingly wrote to Balj,   VOL. II. G",79,book_6,

They revolt  against him.    42 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v.    inviting him to come over, and promising great rewards to him and his troops in  case they should succeed in reducing the Berbers. When Balj received Ibn  Kattan’s letters, his uncle Kolthtim was just dead; so that, seeing no hope of pro-  motion or advantage in Africa, and being moreover unable to extricate himself from  his perilous position, that chief readily accepted the offer made to him, and crossed  over to Andalus. On the arrival of his Syrian auxiliaries, Ibn Kattan failed not to  receive them with the greatest courtesy, making them extensive grants of land, and  conferring on them many other favours. It was, however, previously agreed  between the two parties, that as soon as their united forces had exterminated the  Berbers, Balj and his Syrians should return to Africa; in security for which they  were to give ’Abdu-l-malek a certain number of hostages. These conditions being  mutually agreed upon, the Syrians were divided into two corps, the command of  which was given by ’Abdu-l-malek to his two sons, Kattan and Umeyyah, who  marched immediately against the Berbers, who by that time had collected together  considerable forces. The two armies met soon afterwards, when, after a most  desperate and well contested battle, the wheel of fortune turned against the Berbers,  and they were defeated, notwithstanding their forces were so numerous as to render it  impossible for any but Allah, their Creator, to estimate their amount. The Arabs  pursued them with great slaughter through the provinces of Andalus, until their  fugitive remainsereached the extreme frontiers of the Mussulman empire, or  succeeded in hiding themselves from the eyes of the Syrian hawks.   In the mean while Balj and his followers were elated with success ; their nostrils  swelled with pride; their hands were filled with spoils; their strength and im-  portance waxed greater; their ambition was kindled; they broke the agreements  they had entered into, and forgot the conditions they had signed; and when Ibn  Kattan, agreeably to their engagements, requested them to leave Andalus, they  refused to do so, making all sorts of excuses to put off their departure. At last,  throwing off the mask of dissimulation, they began to complain bitterly of the  injuries received at the hands of Ibn Kattan, when, being besieged in Ceuta, he not  only would not give them any assistance, but had besides sentenced and put to  death, as related elsewhere, an Arab, who, in violation of his orders, had sent them  provisions and stores: they declared themselves in open rebellion, deposed Ibn  Kattan, and appointed in his stead their general, Balj Ibn Beshr. The new governor  was therefore acknowledged throughout the country ; the troops, even those of Ibn  Kattan, having declared in his favour. After this, Balj was advised by his followers to    They take him put Ibn Kattan to death ;® but this he would not do, in consequence of which the    prisoner,    people of Yemen showed their discontent, and said to him: ‘‘ Thou wishest to spare  ‘‘Tbn Kattan because he belongs to the tribe of Modhar, and is therefore one of thy",80,book_6,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 43    “‘ kindred. By Allah! unless thou deliver him immediately into our hands, we  ‘swear not to obey thy commands.” MHearing which, and seeing his men de-  termined to have their revenge, Balj ordered the deposed governor into his presence,  and delivered him into the hands of the infuriated soldiery. The author whose  narrative we transcribe says, that ’Abdu-l-malek was a tall and muscular old man,  resembling a young ostrich ; he was then ninety years of age.? When young, he  had been present at the famous battle of Al-hdrrah,® fought between the Syrians  and the people of Medinah. While the executioners were binding his hands,  one of them addressed him thus: ‘‘ We have thee at last; thou didst once  ‘“‘ escape from our swords at the battle of Al-hdérrah ; after which thou doomedst  ‘* us to eat dogs and the skins of animals, and didst refuse us all supplies, that we  “ might all die in Ceuta from hunger and thirst ; but thou art now in our hands,  “‘ and revenge must have its course.” *Abdu-l-malek was instantly beheaded, and [xt him  crucified in the manner above described.   By the death of ’Abdu-l-malek, the government of Andalus devolved on Balj The sons of    ""Abdu-l-malek  the Syrian, as above mentioned; but he had soon to contend against Kattan and march against    Umeyyah, the two sons of the deceased, who, assisted by the tribe of Fehr, and “  by all the discontented, and many others who took offence at the execution of the  late governor, advanced towards Cordova at the head of a considerable army.  Balj went out to meet them, and gave them battle; but although fortune proved  favourable to his arms, and the Fehrites were defeated, he himself was mortally  wounded, and died soon after the action, in the year 124, one year or so after his  usurpation of the power. The particulars of this engagement are thus described by  a trustworthy historian :—‘‘ When Kattan and Umeyyah, the two sons of ’Abdu-l-  ‘“ malek, heard of their father’s execution, they fled from Cordova, and, having  ‘collected together some forces, swore to revenge their father’s blood. They  “« were soon joined not only by all the Arabian tribes which had settled? in Andalus  “« previous to the arrival of the Syrians, and who were envious at their success,  ‘“‘ but by the Berbers themselves, who from all parts of the country now flocked  “under their standard. Among the former was ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Habib Ibn  ‘“« Abi ’Obeydah Ibn ’Okbah Ibn NAfi’ Al-fehri,!° one of the generals of the army,  ‘‘who had hitherto followed the party of Balj; but who, seeing the barbarous  “« retaliation committed on his cousin ’Abdu-l-malek, deserted the banners of that  “ chief, and passed over to the enemy with a considerable body of troops. Their  “ ranks were further increased by the arrival of ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn ’Alkamah  “ Al-lakhmi, governor of Narbonne, the bravest knight in Andalus, who likewise  ‘“ embraced their party: the combined forces of the rebels, amounting to upwards  ‘“‘ of one hundred thousand men, then marched to besiege Balj in Cordova.

Arabs, who were  ‘ranged under his banners. When the two armies met, the Syrians fought with  ‘‘ desperate valour, performing feats of arms the like of which never before were  ‘witnessed. In the midst of the engagement, however, Ibn ’Alkamah thus  ‘‘ addressed his followers: ‘ Show me where Balj is, that I may look for him,  “ transfix him with this my spear, or, by Allah! die at his hands.’ Upon which one  ‘ of his borderers '? pointed out to him the spot where Balj was, and Ibn ’Alkamah  “‘made a desperate charge at the head of his own men. The Syrian knights,  ‘‘ unable to withstand the shock, gave way, and a passage was thus opened which  “enabled Ibn ’Alkamah to penetrate into the middle of their ranks. Having  ‘“‘ reached the spot where Balj fought, he wounded him twice with his spear, and  “threw him off his saddle. Notwithstanding this mishap the Syrians fought so  “‘ well, that after some time the Beladi Arabs were completely routed and took to  “ flight, being closely pursued by the Syrians, who made great slaughter among  “them, and took many prisoners; victory thus remaining to those who had lost  ‘ their general in the action.”’""? This battle, and the death of Balj, who, as we have  already observed, died of his wounds two days after,’* happened in the month of  Shawwal, a.H. 124 (Sept. a.p. 742), eleven months’ after his coming into power.  Like his predecessors, Balj held his court at Cordova.   After the death of their general, the Syrians appointed to succeed him Tha’lebah  Ibn Saldmah Al-’dmeli, by others called Al-jodhdmi ;'* but before we proceed any  further, we think it important to observe that the Arabs who entered Andalus with  Balj were known by the name of Shdmiin (people of Sh4m or Syria), to distinguish  them from those who were already in that country, and came at the time of the  conquest or soon after it: these were called Beladiin. But to return; after  the death of Balj, as related, Tha’lebah Ibn Saldmah Al-’Ameli was appointed by the  Syrians to govern the country, in virtue of a provision received from the Khalif  Hisham to that effect. Tha’lebah ruled the country with great moderation and  justice. Ibnu Khaldiin says ‘“ that he governed it for a period of two years,  ‘although his authority was not acknowledged for more than ten months;” his  partiality for the Yemeni Arabs having become the cause of the desertion of the  tribe of Fehr, and of the civil wars which ensued. It happened thus: soon  after the appointment of Tha’lebah, the first Andalusian settlers from among the  Arabs and the Berbers resolved upon revenging the outrages they had received at  the hands of the Syrians, and accordingly made war upon Tha’lebah, whom they",82,book_6,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 45    besieged in Merida, where he had taken refuge. When the rebels saw Tha’lebah  shut up within the walls of that city, they were greatly rejoiced, and doubted not of  the victory: they thought that their enemy could not escape them, and would ere  long be obliged to give himself up for want of provisions. In this security, and  trusting in their numbers, the besiegers were scattered over the plain before Merida,  without the least order or vigilance. They even began to make preparations for  the solemnization of an approaching festival ;7 which being observed by Tha’lebah,  he chose the moment when they were most careless, and at sunrise of the day  in which they were to celebrate their festival, he made a sally at the head of his  garrison, and succeeded in routing them completely, killing great numbers of them ;  besides taking one thousand prisoners, with all their families'® and children. He  then returned to Cordova, where no less than ten thousand captives, or perhaps  more, taken by the different divisions of his army after the defeat before the walls  of Merida, were brought to him from various parts of the country. Tha’lebah  then encamped outside of Cordova with his troops. It was on a Thursday ; and on  the following day, after prayers, it was his intention to put the whole of his ten  thousand prisoners to the sword. Friday came on, and every one present expected  to see the massacre of the prisoners commence; when, lo! the Khalif’s banner  fluttered in the distance, and, soon after, Abi-l-khattar Hus4m Ibn Dhirar Al-kelbi,  who came to take possession of the government, made his. appearance.   Ibnu Khaldin says that this Abd-I-khattar came to Andalus by the appointment {rh Pt ia,  of Hondhalah Ibn Sefwan, Wali of Africa, with instructions to re-establish public  order, and appease the troubles excited by the contending parties. He sailed from  the port of Tiinis in the month of Moharram of the year 125 (Nov. a.p. 742).  Ibnu Hayydn has words to the same effect, and adds that the reigning Khalif at the  time was Al-walid Ibn Yezid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn Merwén: he places the arrival  of Abj-l-khattér in Cordova in Rejeb, 125 (May, 743), after Tha’lebah had  governed the country for ten months.   ““No sooner,” continues Ibnu Khalditn, ‘ did Abi-l-khattar land in Andalus  ‘‘ than all parties hastened to put down their arms. Tha’lebah himself, Ibn Abi  ** Nes’ah,'® and the two sons of ’Abdu-l-malek, went out to meet him, and swore  “allegiance. Abd-l-khattar treated them all kindly; and Tha’lebah, the late  ‘governor, returned to the East, where he attached himself to Merwadn Ibn  ‘Mohammed, whom he followed in most of his campaigns.” ”   Abi-l-khattaér is generally described as a brave and generous man, and en-  dowed with much prudence and great talents for administration. Finding that the  settlers from Syria were very numerous in Andalus, and that Cordova could no  longer hold them, he scattered them over the country, and gave them lands to",83,book_6,

He gave Elvira and the surrounding country to the people of Damascus,  who, finding it resemble their native country, called it Shdm (Damascus): the  people of Hems (Emessa) he caused to settle at Seville, which received also the  name of Hems. Jayyen (Jaen) was given up to the people of Kenesrin, and called  also by that name, Kenesrin ; the people of Al-urdén had as their share Rayah and  Malaga, both of which they named Al-urdén; Shidhinah, or by others named  Sherish (Xerez), fell to the lot of the people of Palestine, and was therefore called  Filistin. The Egyptians had Tudmir, which, in imitation of the other settlers, they  called Misr ; #1 and lastly, the people of Wasit received Cabra and the neighbouring  districts as their share.   According to Ibnu Hayyén, Abi-l-khattar was an excellent poet: he also evinced  great talents for administration, and his government at first was just and mild, though  he afterwards showed some inclination to favour the Yemeni Arabs in their feuds  against the Modharites, and affronted the tribe of Kays, which is a branch of the  latter ; the consequence of which was that civil war” broke out afresh, and raged  with more violence than ever. The cause of the war is thus related by the histo-  rians: Abi-l-khattér had always shown himself partial to the Arabs of Yemen.  One day a man belonging to his own tribe had an altercation with a man of the  tribe of Kendnah, and although the case was clearly proved against the Yemenf,  who was a cousin of Abi-l-khattar, the governor, swayed by love for his own  people,* decided in favour of his cousin. The Kenani then went to see As-samil  Ibn Hatim Ibn Shamr Al-keldbi, surnamed Abi-l-jaushan, and told him of Abi-l-  khattdr’s injustice. Now this As-samil was one of the principal chiefs™ of the  Beni Modhar; he hated tyranny and oppression, and could not suppress his in-  dignation when he heard of the outrage inflicted on one of his own people, whose  rights he was always the first to defend and support. He goes immediately to see  Abi-1-khattér, and reproaches him with his conduct in language not very moderate ;  upon which Abi-l-khattér answers with abuse: As-samil replies, and things go so  far that Abi-l-khattér orders his guards to seize him, raise him from his seat, and  put him out of the room.” They relate that in the scuffle As-samil received some  blows in the nape of his neck, by which his turban was thrown on one side ; and  that as he was going out of the Amir’s palace a man who was standing at the door  said to him, ‘ O Abi-l-jaushan, what is the matter with thy turban? By Allah!  “ it is all on one side.”—‘ Thou art right, man,” said As-samil, ‘ but I trust  “my people will soon put it right for me.” Saying which, he immediately  retired to his dwelling, and sent for his friends and clients, who came to him in  haste as soon as they heard of the occurrence. When they were all assembled,  As-samil begged them to stay with him; and when the shades of night had",84,book_6,

I have been injured and ill-treated by the  “ Amir; but the affront is not one that falls only on me, it comprises you all as  “‘ my friends and relatives.” He then told them his adventure with Abd-l-khattér ;  upon which his friends replied, ‘‘ If thou declare unto us what kind of revenge  “ it is thy intention to take, we will see whether we can participate in thy designs,  “or not.”—‘ By Allah!” said As-samil, ‘‘ my vengeance shall not be satisfied  “‘ with any thing short of taking the command from the hands of this Arab: in  “order to accomplish which, I intend to quit Cordova secretly this very night,  ‘“‘and betake myself where I can expect help and security; for I see at present  “‘ no other way of carrying my plans into execution. Whither do ye think I had  “better go? To whom shall I apply for aid?”—‘‘ Go wherever thou likest,”  said his friends, ‘‘ provided it be not to the dwelling of Abi ’Atté Al-kaysi; for he  ‘‘is incapable of lending thee any assistance, and will never do any thing that  ‘* may turn to thy advantage.” This Abii ’Atté was an Arabian chief, who enjoyed  great authority and power in the city of Ezija, the place of his residence: he was  a great enemy of As-samil, and his rival in every thing. All those present at this  interview assented to this advice, except Abi Bekr Ibn Tofayl Al-’abadi, who,  although still a youth, enjoyed great consideration and respect in the tribe: he  alone refused to give his opinion, and kept silence; which being observed by  As-samil, he addressed him thus:—‘t Why dost thou not speak, O Ibn Tofayl?  “‘ What is thy advice? ”’—‘‘ I have only one thing to say,” replied the youth,  “‘ which is, that if thou do not go to see Abi ’Att4, and persist in thy enmity to  “him, this our conspiracy will certainly not succeed, and we shall all of us meet  “‘with our death. If, on the contrary, thou go to see him, I am sure he will  “‘ forget what has passed between you; he will be moved by love to thee and  “his tribe, and he will do any thing thou wishest him to do.”—‘‘ Well said!”  replied As-samil; ‘thine is the best advice, and I will certainly act upon it.”  He accordingly left Cordova that very night, and repaired to Ezija, where he  visited Abi ’Attd, who, being a generous and forgiving man, immediately tendered  him such aid to his cause as he could bestow.

Having therefore fixed upon Shidhiinah (Sidonia) as the place  of their meeting, the rebels mustered their forces, and marched against Abi-l-  khattér, whom they defeated with great slaughter on the banks of the Wada-Leke,”*    Is defeated  and taken  prisoner.",85,book_6,

They say that when As-samil and Thudbah saw that governor  in their power, their first intention was to put him to death; but they delayed  his execution, and took him in irons te Cordova, where he was confined to a strong  tower in the walls. All this happened in the month of Rejeb of the year 127  (April or May, a. p. 745), two years after Abu-l-khattér had taken possession of  the government of Andalus.   Abi-l-khattar, however, did not remain long in confinement, having soon after  succeeded in making his escape, with the assistance of his friends. Abi-1-khattar’s  liberation happened thus: A friend of his, named ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ibn Hossdn  Al-kelbi,® came to Cordova one night, accompanied by thirty horsemen and a  small body of infantry, all men of tried courage, and in whose experience and  fidelity he could trust. Having made a sudden attack upon the tower where  Abi-l-khattéar was detained, they massacred the guards, and liberated the deposed  governor, who retired with them to the western provinces.   No sooner did the news of Abi-l-khattdr’s liberation, and his readiness to assert  his rights, spread over the country, than he was joined by the Yemeni Arabs, who  from all sides flocked under his banners ; and he was thus enabled to resume the  offensive, and march upon Cordova. Thudbah in the mean time was not inactive.  Having assembled his forces, he went out to meet him in company with As-samil.  The two hosts were in presence of each other, and ready to commence the engage-  ment, when an Arab of the tribe of Modhar rose by night (and placing himself within  hearing of Abii-l-khattar’s followers), began crying out at the top of his voice,—‘‘ O  “« Arabs of Yemen! why expose yourselves to the fortunes of war? and why try  “‘ to avert the fate which awaits Abi-l-khattar? Has he not been already in our  “ power, and at our discretion? Nay, had we chosen to put him to death, we  “ might easily have accomplished it ; but we had pity on him, and we spared his  “life. The governor appointed by us belongs also to your tribe. Why do you  ‘not think of your situation? If Thuabah belonged to any other tribe but your  *‘ own, you might have an excuse in your rising ; but as it is, you have none. And  ‘“‘ do not imagine that these sentiments are uttered through a wish on our part to  “ conciliate you, or through fear of your spears; it is only our love of peace, and  “ our anxiety to stop the effusion of blood, and to promote the welfare of the people  ‘of this country in general, which dictate them.’ These words had the desired  effect. They were listened to with attention by the followers of Abi-l-khattér,  who said, ‘‘ By Allah! that man is right.” And accordingly they marched away  that very night, and on the morning of the next day they were some miles from the  field of battle.

This happened towards the end of the month Africas  of Rejeb of the year 127 (April, a.p. 745), when the country was in some  manner pacified, all the power being concentrated in the hands of Thudbah, or   rather of As-samil, who was his second in command. Thudbah governed Andalus   for a year or so, after which time he died.*’ In the work of Ibnu-l-faradhi, how-   ever, the government of Thudbah is said to have lasted two years.   The same writer (Abd-l-walid Ibnu-l-faradhi) describes Abi-I-khattar as a noble  and high-minded man; only that, being descended from a tribe of Yemen, he  showed too great a partiality to the people of his kindred, and was ill-disposed  towards the Beni Modhar. He affronted the tribe of Kays: this being the cause of  the rising of their chief, As-samil, who deposed him, and appointed in his room  Thudbah Ibn Saldmah, as elsewhere related. Ibnu-l-faradhi adds, that the two  factions continued after this to wage war against one another; that Abi-l-khattdr  was deposed four years and nine months* after his taking possession of the  government, in the year 128 (beginning Oct. 2, a.p. 745), and that he was at last  put to death by As-samil, and replaced by Thuabah Ibn Saldmah in the government  of Andalus. But to return.   Tbnu Khaldiin says, ‘“‘ About this time civil war raged in Africa, and the empire  “of the Beni Umeyyah began to decay in the East. The Khalifs of that dynasty  ‘* were assailed by rebels in every distant province, and the power and importance  ‘of the wearers of the black colours (’Abbasides) waxed every day greater. In  ‘‘the mean time the people of Andalus were left to themselves, and without a  “ruler. At first the administration was carried on in the name of ’Abdu-r-rahman  ‘« Tbn Kethir ; ° but afterwards the army decided upon dividing the empire between  ‘the two rival factions, the Beni Modhar and the Arabs of Yemen, in such a  “manner that each party should govern the country for one year, when they  “‘ would resign the command into the hands of the other. The Beni Modhar,  ‘* who were to be the first, appointed, in the year 129, as their commander, Yusuf  “ Tbn ’Abdi-r-rahman Al-fehri, who accordingly governed the country for one year,  “‘ taking up his residence at Cordova. But when, after the expiration of that  “‘ year, the Yemenis sought to be put in possession of the government, according  “to the agreement entered into with the opposite party, Yusuf, accompanied by  “ As-samil Ibn Hatim and the tribe of Kays, and all the other tribes issued  “from the stock of Modhar, made one night a sudden attack upon Shekundah,  ‘“‘a village close to Cordova,** where the Yemenis had taken up their abode, and  “‘ massacred the greater part of them.

Ibnu Hayyan relates these events differently: he says, ‘‘ When Abi-l-khattér  “heard of his [Ytsuf’s] appointment, he put his Yemenis into requisition ; and all  “ answered his call, this being the cause of the celebrated battle of Shekundah,  . “fought between the Beni Modhar and the Arabs of Yemen. They say that   Battle of She- *< there never was, either in the East or the West, a more bloody and contested  ‘“‘ battle than that of Shekundah, nor one in which greater feats of arms were  “* performed by the warriors on both sides, who fought until the edges of their  “‘ swords were softened by the blows, when each man seized his adversary by the  “hair, and fought with his hands until they fell down exhausted and tired of  “‘ dealing and receiving blows. However, it appears that As-samil, having upon  “a certain day received intelligence that his enemies were not upon their guard,  “ called together all the tradespeople and shopkeepers * of Cordova, and, putting  “himself at their head, resolved to make a sudden attack upon the Yemenis.  ‘“« Having selected four hundred of the most determined and bravest among them,  ‘armed with knives, sticks, and such other weapons as they could procure,—a  “* few only being provided with either spears or swords,—he led them against the  ‘“*'Yemenis, who, being unprepared for the attack, were seized with a sudden panic,  “and fled in every direction before the people of Cordova, without returning their  “ blows, or attempting even to parry those dealt to them.*%* They were hotly  ‘pursued by the enemy, who made great slaughter in their ranks. So great was  “‘ the loss which the Yemenfs sustained on this memorable occasion, that but few   Death of Abu- “* of their number outlived the bloody encounter. Abu-I-khattdr, among others,  “ fled the field of battle, and took refuge in a neighbouring mill, where he remained  “for some time concealed under the mill-stone:3”? he was, however, detected  ‘“‘ and brought to the presence of As-samil, who had him immediately beheaded.”  The above is borrowed from the work of Ibnu Hayyan.   The grandsons The historians of Andalus have recounted at length some transactions in which  the grandsons of King Wittiza were concerned, during the administration of Abi-1-  khattér. After the death of Almond, who was the eldest son of that monarch,  and who, as related,®* left a daughter called Sdérah, and two sons in tender age,  Artabdsh seized the states of his nephews, and appropriated them to himself. This  happened at the beginning of the Khalifate of Hisham Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek. When  Sérah, the Goth, saw herself and brothers thus deprived of their father’s inheritance,  she laid a complaint before Abu-l-khattér ; but seeing that justice was not speedily  done to her, she determined upon repairing to the East in person, and getting  redress from the Khalif. Accordingly, having fitted out a good vessel, and provided",88,book_6,
"    CHAP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 51    it with the necessary stores for the voyage, she embarked at Seville with her two  brothers, and set sail for Syria. Having landed at ’Askaltin (Ascalon), a sea-port  on the shores of that country, Sarah proceeded to Damascus, where the Khalif  Hisham Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek held his court. After informing that Sultan of her case,  she implored justice against her uncle, and begged him to issue orders to Abi-l-  khattdr to re-instate her and her brothers in all the lands belonging to their father,  as contained in the capitulation entered into with Tarik, and confirmed by his  predecessor, the Khalif Al-walid. Hisham was much pleased with Sarah, whose  courage and determination he greatly admired: he treated her kindly, and admitted  her to his privacy ; and when she expressed her wish to depart, gave her a letter  for Hondhalah Ibn Sefwan Al-kelbi, his governor of Eastern Africa, intrusting him  with the redress of the injury she had sustained at the hands of her uncle Artabdsh,  and bidding him to have restored to her and her brothers all those states which,  in conformity with the laws of succession, might belong to them as their father’s  inheritance. Hondhalah did as he was commanded: he gave Sérah a letter for his  lieutenant in Andalus (Abd-1-khattar), who, on receipt of it, put her and her brothers  in full possession of all their rights.   According to other authorities, before Sarah quitted Syria, Hisham gave her  in marriage to a noble Arab, named ""Isa Ibn Ibrahim, who dwelt with her at  Damascus for some time, but who, on the return of Sarah to Andalus, accompanied  her to that country, where he soon after recovered from her uncle Artabdish the  possession of all her states, through which he was enabled to live in great affluence  and comfort. ""Isa had by her two sons, one named Ibrahim, the other Is‘hak,  both of whom held offices of trust at Seville, the place of their residence, and were  very much esteemed and respected on account of their descent on the mother’s side  from the Gothic kings of Andalus.   They relate likewise, that whilst Sarah was staying at the court of Hishém, she  met in one of her visits to that Khalif his grandson ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Mu’Awiyah,  the same who in after-time became the master of Andalus, and that to this circum-  stance she owed the great favour which she always enjoyed with that monarch ;  for when ’Abdu-r-rahmaén had conquered the whole of Andalus, Sarah hastened to  Cordova to compliment him on his good success, and she failed not to recall herself  to his memory, and recommend herself to his good graces as a Christian living  in his dominions. ’Abdu-r-rahman then recollected her, and granted her the  privilege of entering at all hours the royal palace whenever she went to Cordova.  In this manner he continued bestowing on her new honours and distinctions, going  so far as to grant her leave to visit his harem and see his wives and daughters  without their veils on.

Many truly royal acts have been recorded of this princess, as well as of her  father Almond, and of her uncle Artabdsh, living, as they did, under the Arabian  Amirs, who at that time governed Andalus. The following anecdote, related by the  theologian Mohammed Ibn ’Omar Ibn Lebbanah,*® is one: ‘‘ Ten of the principal  “ Arab chieftains, amongst whom were As-samil, Ibnu-t-tofayl,*° Abi ’Abdah, and  other noble Syrians, came once to visit Artabash, who received them with the  greatest attention, and caused them to sit down on the cushions surrounding  “his hall. Soon after, a pious man named Maymin,“! the progenitor of the Beni  Hazm, and who, though a Syrian too, did not associate much with them, on  account of his very pious and abstemious habits, entered the room ; and no sooner  did Artabash see him than he got up to receive him (this being an honour which  he had not done to the rest of his guests), and bidding him ascend a gilded couch  upon which he was reclining, made him a sign to sit in his own place. This  favour, however, Maymtn most obstinately refused, and, notwithstanding the  entreaties of Artabash, he sat himself on the floor; seeing which, the prince did  the same, and sat alongside of Maymin, turning his face towards him, and his  back to the company. ‘O Artabdsh,’ inquired Maymitin in amazement, ‘ what  makes thee treat one like me in this way?’ Artabdsh then said, ‘ hast thou not  heard *? that we came to this country as enemies? and therefore never thought  that our residence would be a long one; we were not in any way prepared to  stay, and had not a large stock of provisions with us. After we are dead, thou  ‘mayest tell our maulis how we despaired of ever returning to our native places.’  Maymin then replied, ‘God has given thee plenty of fortune’s gifts, and I  wish thee to let me have one of thy farms, that I may cultivate the land with  my own hands, and make over the produce of it to thee, after deducting the  sum required for my maintenance.’—‘I will with great pleasure,’ answered  Artabash ; ‘ but, instead of a farm in which thou wilt have only a small interest, I  shall give thee the entire possession of it.’ He then sent for the chief of his  “household, and addressed him thus: ‘Thou shalt deliver into the hands of  Maymiin our farm so and so, on the banks of the river Shiis,*? with all the  slaves, beasts, and cattle appertaining to it; and thou shalt besides put him in  “ possession of our estate in Jaen.’ These orders being readily complied with,  ‘* Maymiin became the owner of extensive property, in which he was succeeded by  “his son. To them owes its name a fortress in that territory called Kal’ah-  “ Hazm.” The authors who have recorded this anecdote add, ‘‘ that no sooner  “had Maymin, after returning due thanks for so signal a favour, taken leave of",90,book_6,

As to thyself,  “‘ (may God Almighty prosper thee!) thou hast already sufficient honour, since  “‘ men regard thee on account of thy dignity and thy power, whilst this poor man  “has no one else to protect and favour him but God. We have been told of  “a saying of the Messiah, (peace be on Him!) who said once to his people, ‘ He  ‘“‘who has been honoured in this world by other men being made subservient to’  “him, his honour agrees with his nature, as if he swallowed a stone.’ As-samil was  ‘an illiterate man, and hence the allusion made by Artabdsh in his reply. After  “ this, As-samil’s friends spoke to him thus: ‘ Enough of this; let us drop the  “ unprofitable question, and proceed to business by stating the object of our visit.’  ‘“« They then told Artabash, ‘ We want precisely the same thing thou hast granted  “this man; and since thou hast been so generous with one so low, we are curious  “* to see how thou wilt deal with us who are the principal men of the land.’—‘ You  ‘‘ are right,’ answered Artabash ; ‘ he was only a subject, whilst you all are princes  ‘and lords; you will not therefore like to receive from me but what is great and  ‘handsome: I give you one hundred farms, to be equally divided among you, ten  “to each.’ He then sent for the chief of his household, and having issued the  “‘ necessary orders in writing, As-samil and his friends were immediately put in  “« possession of their respective estates, which were the best possessed by Artabash.”  But to resume the thread of our narrative.   Thudbah was succeeded by Ytsuf Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmdin Ibn Habib Ibn Abi  ’Obeydah Ibn ’Okbah Ibn Naf’ Al-fehri, who was the descendant of [’Okbah]  the governor of Eastern Africa, and the founder of Cairwan, he of the praise-  worthy deeds and glorious conquests, whose memory shall for ever live, the  stock of a family which obtained no small share of power both in Africa and  in Andalus. According to the historian Ar-razi, Yusuf Al-fehri was born in the Susi Al fel  city of Cairwdn, whence his father, ’Abdu-r-rahman, crossed over to Andalus, by the army.  together with [his grandfather] Habib Ibn Abi ’Obeydah Al-fehri, at the time of  the conquest of that country. ’Abdu-r-rahman returned to Eastern Africa; but",91,book_6,

The same writer (Ar-rdzi) relates, that on the day on  which Yisuf took possession of the government he was fifty-seven years of age,  and that he was elected to that office by the army and the people, after the death  of Thudbah, and when the country had been four months without a ruler. He  owed his appointment to the suggestions of As-samil, who recommended him on  account of his being a Korayshite ; which circumstance, that chief thought, might  lead, if not to the entire reconciliation of the rival tribes, at least to a suspension  of hostilities. So it happened: both parties put down their arms, and acknow-  ledged the authority of Yiisuf, who was thereby enabled to carry on the government  for a period of nine years and nine months.“   Ibnu Hayyan relates that Yusuf’s appointment took place in the month of Rabi’-1-  akhar of the year 129 (Dec. 746, or Jan. 747) ; that he ruled as master in Andalus  without acknowledging any superior, since his nomination did not in any way  emanate from the Khalif, but merely from the troops.   Yiisuf’s government was by no means a tranquil one, as he had to contend with  several chiefs, who on various occasions took the field against him, and aimed at  depriving him both of life and power. He was however successful, and vanquished  all his enemies, until he himself was overpowered and put to death by ’Abdu-r-  rahmén Ad-dakhel, of the royal family of Umeyyah, as we shall presently relate.   Among the chiefs who disputed with Yusuf the government of Andalus, Ibnu  Hayydén counts ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn ’Alkamah Al-lakhmi, governor of Narbonne,  a fortress on the frontiers of the land of the Franks, whose undaunted courage,  great corporal strength, and splendid feats of arms, became proverbial in Andalus,  and won him the surname of Al-fdrisu-l-andalus (the Knight of Andalus). This  ’?Abdu-r-rahman had, on a former occasion, assisted the sons of ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn  Kattan in their revolt against Balj Ibn Beshr, and it was he who dealt this chief  the blow from which he died a few days after the battle. However, as ’Abdu-r-  rahman was preparing to attack Yusuf, he was treacherously put to death by his  own men, who hastened to convey his head to his enemy.   ’Orwah Ibnu-l-walid was the next chieftain who took up arms against Yusuf.  Assisted by the Christians and others, he raised the standard of revolt in the city of  Beja, whence he marched upon Seville, which place he also reduced. His forces  increasing by the arrival of numerous adventurers, who from all parts of the  country flocked under his banners, Yusuf marched in person against him, and put  him to death.   ’A’mir Al-’abdari * rose likewise at Algesiras, but without better success. Ytsuf  marched against him, and made him lay down his arms on condition that he should",92,book_6,
"    CHAP. v.J DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 55    reside at Cordova. After which, however, he had him beheaded, in the year 138  (beginning June 15, 755), as will be related hereafter.   *Amru Ibn Yezid Al-azrak “ is another of the Arabian chiefs who revolted against  Yusuf. Some say that he was the first who resisted his authority, and that he rose  at Seville, but was vanquished and put to death.   Besides the above rebellions, Yvisuf had to quell that of Al-habib‘*? Az-zahri,  an Arabian chieftain, who, on hearing of the victories which the Beni ’Abbds had  obtained in the East over their enemies of the house of Umeyyah, appeared in arms  against Yusuf, and proclaimed the Khalifs of the house of ’Abbds as sovereigns of  Andalus. Having collected a numerous host, he laid siege to Saragossa, where  As-samil commanded in Yisuf’s name. That chief defended himself for a while,  but, seeing he could not hold much longer, sent to Yusuf for aid. This, however,  Yusuf would not grant, as he was angry with As-samil at the time, and wished  for his destruction. At last the tribe of Kays ran to the assistance of their chief,  and, having compelled Al-habab to raise the siege, extricated As-samil from his  dangerous position. Al-habab then returned, and gained possession of Saragossa ;  but, some time after, Yusuf marched in person against him and put him to death.   Yusuf was the last governor of Andalus ; for, in the year 138 (beginning June 15,  755), ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Mu’awiyah, a scion of the illustrious house of Umeyyah,  which had been in possession of the Khalifate for a period of nearly ninety years,  arrived in Andalus, where, with the assistance of the numerous partisans and  adherents of his family, he was enabled to contend successfully against him, and  to found a durable empire for his posterity. But, as it is our intention to relate  in detail the events which led to this mighty revolution, we need not further allude  to them here, and will now give the chronology of the Governors of Andalus.   Tarik was the first governor of Andalus ; then came Miisa Ibn Nosseyr: neither Seemed or  of them, however, fixed his residence in that country. Then came ’Abdu-l-’aziz, of Andalus.  son of Misa, who held his court at Seville, where he was murdered. After him  Aytib Ibn Habib Al-lakhmi, who transferred the seat of the government to Cordova.  After him all the Governors or Sultans of Andalus held their court at that city,  or at Az-zahr4, as is well known and we shall hereafter relate, until the dynasty  of the Beni Merwén was finally overthrown. Then came Al-horr Ibn ’Abdi-r-  rahmaén Ath-thakef{; then As-samh Ibn Malik Al-khaulani; then ’Abdu-r-rahman  Ibn ’Abdillah Al-ghéfeki; then ’Anbasah Ibn Sohaym Al-kelbi; then ’Ozrah Ibn  *Abdillah Al-fehri; then Yahya Ibn Salmah Al-kelbi; then Othman Ibn Abi  Nes’ah Al-khath’ami; then Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Al-ashja’i; then ’Abdu-l-  malek Ibn Kattan Al-fehri; then Balj Ibn Beshr Ibn “Iyddh Al-kusheyri; then  Tha’lebah Ibn Sal4mah Al-jodhami; then Thudbah Ibn Salamah Al-jodhaémi; then",93,book_6,

These are the governors who ruled over  Andalus without transmitting the command as an inheritance to their posterity, or  assuming any other title but that of Amir (Governor). They swayed the country  for a period of forty-six years, two. months and six days, counting from the day  on which Roderic the Goth, King of Andalus, was defeated and killed, that is to  say, on Sunday, the 5th of Shawwél of the year 92 (July 26, a.p. 711), to that  on which the Governor Yisuf Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman was defeated, and. his rival,  ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Mu’dwiyah, of the royal house of Umeyyah, gained possession  of the empire, and made his triumphant entry into Cordova, namely, on the day of  idu-l-adhdhi (festivity of the victims), or the tenth of Dhi-l-hajjah of the year 138  (May 15, a.p. 756).   All these Amirs (Governors) were appointed either by the Governors of Africa,  of which Andalus was then a dependency, or by the Khalifs of the house of Merwan  (the Beni Umeyyah), who ruled in the East, and were the sole Imdms of the  Moslems, until the civil war was kindled, and their mighty dynasty, which had  lasted for a period of one thousand months, was overthrown by the Beni ’Abbas,  who succeeded them in the empire, and scattered them like dust before the wind.   In course of time, however, Andalus shook off the yoke of the Beni ’Abbds; for  *Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Mu’dwiyah Ibn Hisham Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn Merwan, after  surmounting all manner of dangers, wrested that country from them, and made  it the seat of a powerful empire for himself and his sons, collecting round hint the  relics of his family, and surrounding himself with the freedmen and adherents of  his ancestors: in short, the whole of Andalus submitted to him, and, after his death,  to his posterity, who held the supreme power there for a long space of time; God  Almighty being pleased to grant him victory over his enemies, the Beni ’Abbas,  who, wishing to regain possession of Andalus, and to extirpate all the members  of the rival house, frequently sent armies to invade that country, or instigated the  chiefs of the Arabian tribes there to take up arms against ’Abdu-r-rahmédn, and to  proclaim the supremacy of their own family. But all their attempts proved  unsuccessful ; for that Sultan defeated one after the other all those who were in arms  against him, and put numbers of them to the sword, principally during the Khalifate  of Abt Ja’far Al-manstr, as we shall relate more at large when we come to treat of  the establishment of the house of Umeyyah in Andalus.   We have now given in the preceding pages the cream of the information to be  found in the work of Ibnu Khaldtn, as collected or compiled from various historical  sources. As for ourselves, we have added, when required, such information as we  deemed sufficient [to illustrate this narrative], or pointed out to the reader the  contradictions occurring in the works of ancient historians.

We must also inform our  readers that the above extracts on the history of Andalus, from its conquest by  Tarik Ibn Zeyad to the arrival of ’Abdu-r-rahman, are chiefly taken from the works  of Ibnu Hayyan and Ibnu Khaldin, two celebrated historians, who had access to  the best sources of information: the former author especially, who, in his two  historical works, the Matin and the Muktabis, preserved almost every tradition  current in his time on the events here recorded, mentions a long poem, which an  Andalusian writer, named Yahya Ibn Hakem Al-ghazzél, wrote in the species of  metre called rejéz, wherein he describes most minutely the causes of the invasion  of Andalus ; the chief battles therein fought between the Moslems and the Goths ;  and lastly, the number and the names of the Amirs who administered the affairs  of that country until the arrival of ’Abdu-r-rahmaén Ibn Mu’dwiyah ;—“‘ a work,”  observes Ibnu Hayyan, “‘ exceedingly instructive and useful, and which may be  “« found in the hands of most people.”   We shall now proceed, with the help of God, to relate the events which led to  the establishment of the family of Merwan or Beni Umeyyah in Andalus.

His adventures are thus related by  the historian Ibnu Hayyén in his Muktabis :  ‘* When the empire of the Beni Umeyyah was overthrown in the East, and the",96,book_6,

The following account of his adventures   “‘ whilst flying from his enemies has been handed down to us as related by ’Abdu-r-   “‘ rahmdn himself: ‘ As I was on a certain day sitting under cover of my tent, to   ‘‘ shelter myself from the rain, which fell heavily, and watching my eldest son   ‘* Suleyman, then about four years old, who was playing in front of it, I saw him Is pursued by  “* suddenly enter the door, crying violently ; and, soon after, he ran towards me, and of Ae-sefféh.  “ clung to my bosom for protection. Not knowing what he meant, I pushed him  ‘away; but the child clung still more to me, as one seized with violent fear, and   “* began uttering such exclamations as children are wont to utter when they are   “ frightened. I then left the tent, that I might see what caused his fear; when lo!   **T saw the whole village in confusion, and the inhabitants running to and fro   ‘‘in great consternation. I went a little further on, and saw the black banners   “« [of the ’Abbdssides] fluttering in the wind. At sight of these a younger brother   “of mine, who had also rushed out of the tent, and was with me at the time,   ‘* began to fly at the top of his speed, saying, ‘ Away! away with thee, O brother!   “ for yonder black banners are the banners of the sons of ’Abbds.’ Hearing this,   ‘‘ T hastily grasped some dinars which I had just at hand, and fled precipitately out   “« of the village with my child and my younger brother, taking care to apprise my   ‘« sisters of my departure, and of the road we intended to take; and bidding them   “join us at a spot which I named, together with my freedman Bedr, who was the   ‘‘ bearer of my message. In this manner we escaped from our pursuers, and halted   “at a spot some distance from the village. Scarcely had we left our tent when it   ‘“‘ was surrounded by a body of cavalry, who scrupulously searched every corner   ‘‘ of it; but finding no one inside, they withdrew, and soon after left the village.   “Tn the mean time Bedr joined us, bringing with him a man well acquainted with   ‘‘ the course of the Euphrates and its banks, to act as our guide, whom I directed   “to purchase for: us horses and the articles requisite for our journey.

In this way I took refuge in a thick forest,  “and hid myself amongst the trees, until the pursuit ceased ; I then left my place  “* of concealment, and fied the country, taking the route to the west, until I reached  «« Eastern Africa,’ ”’ &c.-   Ibnu Hayydn continues. ‘‘ After the above adventure, ’Abdu-r-rahman fled the  ‘“‘ country with the utmost speed he could use, and marched until he arrived in  ‘« Eastern Africa, whither his own sister, Ummu-l-asbagh, and his two freedmen,  “« Bedr and Sélim, had preceded him, provided with money for their sustenance,  “and jewels. Other relatives or partisans of the proscribed family of Umeyyah  “had likewise taken refuge in the same province, where ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn  “ Habib Al-fehri* was then governing in the Khalif’s name. It happened, however,  “ that this governor was on terms of intimacy with a Jewish astrologer and sooth-  “ sayer, who had once been a servant of Moslemah Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, one of the  ‘“« Beni Umeyyah, but was now attached to the Beni ""Abbas. This man having upon  “‘a certain occasion found Ibn Habib alone, spoke to him thus: ‘ A Korayshite  “‘ youth, of the family of Merwén, descended from kings, shall in time become",98,book_6,

So it happened; for soon after ’Abdu-r-rahman’s arrival in Eastern  “* Africa, he was recognised by one of the officers, and brought to the presence  ‘of Ibn Habib, who, seeing the two locks of hair on his head, sent for the Jew,  “and spoke to him thus: ‘ By thy life! this is the very youth mentioned in thy  ‘¢ prophecy ; he must die.’ The Jew then said, ‘If thou kill him, he is not the  ‘* person intended ; if, on the contrary, thou spare his life, he must conquer and  “reign:’ upon which he let him go. However, several of the Beni Umeyyah  ‘had taken refuge in Eastern Africa, trusting that the governor Ibn Habib, who  ‘‘ was an adherent of their family, would allow them to live in peace in those  ‘remote regions; but, contrary to their expectations, he persecuted them, and  ‘‘ obliged them to leave the country. Two sons of Al-walid Ibn Yezid, who had  * taken refuge in his territory, he caused to be seized under some false pretence,  ‘‘and put to death. He also confiscated the property of Isma’fl Ibn Aban Ibn  “* *Abdi-l-’aziz Ibn Merwén, another of the Beni Umeyyah, and married a sister of  ‘his against his will and express injunctions. After this he tried to seize the Eee  “person of ’Abdu-r-rahman ; but having received timely intelligence, this prince governor.  “ hid himself, and succeeded in reaching a place of safety.” So far Ibnu Hayyén.   Other accounts state, that when ’Abdu-r-rahmén left Palestine for Africa, he had  with him besides Bedr, who had been a freed slave of his father, three other  servants whose names were Abii Shafa’, ’Amru, and Yezid; that he stopped at Wanders  Maghilah, where he was hospitably entertained by a Berber chief named Abt country.  Korrah WAnestis, who secreted him some time at his house. Here it was that his  freedman Bedr overtook him, bringing with him the jewels and gold sent by his  sister Ummu-l-asbagh. One day, as ’Abdu-r-rahmén was in the tent of this chief,  the emissaries of Ibn Habib, the governor, suddenly made their appearance, and  searched all the corners of it; but the Berber’s wife, named Tekfah, hid him under  her clothes, and by this means concealed ’Abdu-r-rahman from the eyes of his  pursuers. It is further related, that ’Abdu-r-rahmén never forgot the signal service  he received on this occasion; for, when he became King of Andalus, he invited  ‘Wanesis and his wife to Cordova, and treated them kindly, admitting them to his  privacy, and conferring on them all sorts of honours and distinctions.

"    62 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    chose; and more than one anecdote has been handed down to us to show the great  favour she always enjoyed with the prince.‘   The historian Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakem relates that ’Abdu-r-rahman passed five years in  concealment in the town of Barkah ; at the end of which time he quitted that place,  and travelled through the country until he arrived at Tihart, a city of Central  Maghreb, where he placed himself under the protection of a tribe called the  Beni Rustam, who were then the lords of that country. Thence he visited the  encampments of various Berber tribes, and at last fixed his quarters not far from  the sea, in the territory of a tribe called Zendtah. It was from this place that   sends his | ar Abdu-r-rahmén first cast a wistful eye upon Andalus, and dispatched his freedman  to Andalus. Bedr with messages to the numerous clients and adherents of his family who were  in that country.   At that time the number of maulis or adherents to the family of Merwan,  inscribed on the rolls of the Andalusian army, was very considerable, amounting to   A party is |. between four and five hundred, all men of tried courage, and who had many followers  favour. devoted to them. Their chiefs on this occasion were Abi ’Othmén ’Obeydullah  Ibn ’Othmén and ’Abdullah Ihn Khéled, both of whom had formerly been maulis  of the Khalif ’Othm4n, and had on their arrival in Andalus been intrusted with  the keeping of the banners of the Beni Umeyyah, and had also been invested with  the command of the Syrian Arabs who had settled in the territory of Elvira. To  this Abi Othman, Bedr the freedman brought letters from his master, in which  ’*Abdu-r-rahmén enumerated the benefits conferred by his ancestors of the house of  Umeyyah on Abi ’Othmén, and reminded him of the obligation under which the  latter now lay to serve their cause: he further acquainted him with his own legi-  timate rights to the empire, which he said it was his intention to assert, as the only  surviving heir by true lineal descent from his grandfather Hisham, in whose hands  the Khalifate had been vested. He concluded by asking him to rise in his support,  with such among the adherents of the house of Umeyyah and others as he could  trust ; stating, that if he could only procure him the means of entering Andalus, he  was sure of success ; after which he would not fail to reward him and his friends as  they deserved, and bestow on them all manner of honours and distinctions. He then  gave him directions as to the best means to be employed to gain their object. He  was to seek the assistance of those among his friends in whom he could trust, and  who might aid him in his revolt: he was to take advantage of the mortal feuds and  dissensions then existing between the Arabian tribes of Yemen and the sons of  Modhar, who, from long-existing hereditary wrongs, hated each other most heartily,  and were sure readily to embrace any cause in opposition to that of their adversaries.",100,book_6,
"    cHapP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 63    Abd ’Othmén immediately agreed to what was requested of him, stimulated, no  doubt, by the prospect of his own personal advantage. When Bedr arrived with ~  this message, ?Othmén was preparing to march to Saragossa, in the Thagher, to the  relief of the governor As-samil Ibn Hétim, who had been besieged there by a  rebellious chieftain named Az-zohri; for Yusuf Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén, then supreme  governor of Andalus, having received intelligence of As-samil’s dangerous situation,  had directed him to hasten to his aid with the disposable forces of his district ; and  in compliance with this order ’Othmén was about to march to Saragossa, when  *Abdu-r-rahman’s secret message was delivered to him: he nevertheless undertook  his march. Whilst therefore ""Othman was going to Saragossa with his troops, he  one day sent for his son-in-law ’Abdullah Ibn Khaled, who accompanied the  expedition, and addressed him thus: “ Methinks, O Ibn Khiled! that were we  to apprise As-samil of the news brought us by Bedr, we might learn what he  “ thinks about it, and ascertain at the same time whether we can reckon upon him  “or not: should he not agree to take part with us, As-samil, I am persuaded, will  “ never divulge our secret, as I know him to be a man of honour and principle.”  “That may be,” answered ’Abdullah; ‘‘ but were we to do as thou proposest,  “ we could not be sure of success: for although on the one hand his envy of the  “ Sult4n Yusuf, and the high post he occupies, might perhaps induce As-samil to  ‘* embrace the cause of ’Abdu-r-rahmén, it is likely on the other hand that the fear  * of losing under the new sovereign all the power and influence he now enjoys,  “ will prevent him from joining in the undertaking.” To which Abi ’Othm4n  replied, ‘‘ We may easily remove that obstacle by flattering his ambition, and  “ deceivmg him with promises of riches and advancement. We will tell him that  ‘« *Abdu-r-rahman, in coming to this country, has no other object in view than  ‘to obtain security for his person, and claim the fifth of the spoil due to his   “ prandfather Hishdém, and live on its produce.” To this proposal ’Abdullah The conspira-    tors commu-    agreed; and accordingly the two chieftains, before taking leave of As-samil to nicate their  return to their respective districts, took him into a private room, and there disclosed fm  all their plans to him.   It happened as Abii ’Othmdn had foretold. No sooner had he explained his  views to As-samil than that chieftain began to utter complaints against the governor  Yisuf for not hastening to his relief when he was attacked by Al-hobéb Az-zohri in  the neighbourhood of Saragossa, and leaving him to fight single-handed against  the superior forces of his enemy. At last he said to them, ‘‘ You may rely on me rant made  “ for the furtherance of your plans ; write to the youth, and tell him to cross over chieftain.  “to us: when I have heard of his landing, I will go to Yusuf and advise him  “* to do him honour, admit him to his intimacy, and give him one of his daughters",101,book_6,

If he follow my advice, your object is gained ; if he refuse, we shall  “ strike his bald head with our swords, and take the command of this country from  ‘him, to give it to your friend.” This being agreed upon, the two chieftains  heartily thanked As-samil for his proffered assistance, and after kissing his hand  they separated, and retired, each to his destination; As-samil to Toledo, of which  city he had been made governor by Yusuf, who no longer wished to retain him  in the command of the Thagher (Aragon); Abi ’Othmén and his son-in-law  ’Abdullah Ibn Khiled, to their abode in the town of Elvira. At this place many  were already in the secret ; for [before starting for Saragossa] Abi Othman and  *Abdullah had spoken to the officers of the Syrian army quartered in that town,  as well as to other Arabs of distinction, and to all those friends in whom they  could trust, and communicated to them their plans respecting the son of Mu’awiyah  (Abdu-r-rahman). The affair was soon divulged, and talked of among the inhabitants  of the neighbouring towns, spreading like fire among brush-wood ; the conspirators  being not a little assisted in their plans by the circumstance that the year in which  this came to pass was one of great scarcity, as the whole of Andalus had been  visited by a most dreadful famine, which lasted for a long time.   However, there are not wanting authors who relate this affair differently. They  certainly say that As-samil, at first, agreed to the propositions of the conspirators,  and consented to assist them in their undertaking to give the empire to ’Abdu-r-  rahmén, but that after they had left him he thought more seriously on the subject,  and repented of what he had promised ; that he accordingly went to them, and said,  “‘T have weighed attentively all the chances of the undertaking which you wish me  “to share with you, and I find that the youth you recommend belongs to a family,  ‘* one individual of which is enough to set all this island on fire, and that perchance  ‘you and I may perish in the conflagration. Besides, our present ruler [Ytisuf]  “is a man over whose mind I exercise great influence, and on whom I lean  “ for support ; and I do not intend to have him changed for any other. By Allah!  “‘I say more; if on reaching your tents you still persevere in your plans, and  “« continue gaining over partisans to the cause of that youth, I shall be compelled  “to oppose you for my own sake. I therefore give you to understand that my  “« sword shall be the first unsheathed against ’Abdu-r-rahman. I wish you success.”  The conspirators then said to him, ‘‘ Thy advice is our own, and we think as thou  dost.” After which they left him, the better to persuade him that ’Abdu-r-rahmén’s  object in coming to Andalus was not to make himself master of the country.   They returned to Elvira, where they laboured, though in vain, to gain over  to their cause the chiefs of the Arabian tribes of Modhar and Rabi’ah.

They found them a set of men in   whose breasts raged the most violent passions, and who, in order to revenge the   injuries received, were ready to embrace any cause, however desperate. Having ‘Abdur. a  easily persuaded them to join in the undertaking, they concerted together the means i daily    of carrying their project into execution. Profiting by the absence of the Sultan srengthenes  Yuisuf,° who was then in the Thagher (Aragon), and by that of As-samil, who was,  likewise, far off, they commenced their operations. Their first care was to procure  a vessel to send back Bedr: having bought one, they dispatched in her eleven  of their men, with instructions to land near ’Abdu-r-rahmdn’s residence, and  acquaint him with their readiness to uphold his pretensions, and declare for him  the moment he should land in Andalus. In the mean time Abi ’Othman and his  friends, with whom Bedr had left his master’s signet-ring, made ample use of it,  sealing the numerous letters and proclamations which they addressed to their  friends and the people of Andalus in ’Abdu-r-rahmdn’s name. In this manner  the partisans of that prince increased, and the conspiracy spread wide through the  country. However, the emissaries, in whose number was a distinguished officer  named Temdm Ibn ’Alkamah, arrived safely at their destination, and landed near  Maghilah, in the country of the Berbers. They found ’Abdu-r-rahmén, who, since  the departure of his freedman Bedr, had been in a state of great anxiety, and who  was now expecting him every moment, praying fervently on the sea shore. Bedr  was the first man to leap on shore, and to announce to his master the success of his  expedition: he was quickly followed by Temam Ibn ’Alkamah, who, in the name  of his friends, confirmed the good news brought by Bedr. ‘‘ What is thy name?”  said ’Abdu-r-rahmén to him. ‘“‘ Temém.”—‘ And what thy surname? ”—‘ Abi  Ghdlib” (the father of the victorious).—‘‘ God is great!” exclaimed ’Abdu-r-  rahmén ; ‘‘ may his name be exalted! for, if that be the case, we shall, through  ‘‘the power and interposition of the Almighty, conquer that land of yours, and  “ yeign over it.” ’Abdu-r-rahmén could never forget that Tem4m had been the  first man to bring him the good tidings; for when he had vanquished all his  enemies, and was firmly seated on the throne of Andalus, he appointed him his  Hajib, which office he held until the death of his sovereign. But to return.  ’Abdu-r-rahman hastened on board ; but whilst he was doing so, there came to Be ee  the shore a troop of Berbers, who made demonstrations of opposing his embarka-  tion. ’Abdu-r-rahman then took up some dinars,’ which Temaém had brought with  him for the purpose, and gave them to be divided among them; upon which they  all seemed satisfied, and he was allowed to embark: but before the vessel could  quit the shore, there came another party of Berbers, who, not having shared in the  former gift, were determined to oppose his departure. One of them clung to the  VOL. Il. K",103,book_6,

Soon after, a favourable  wind sprung up, which impelled the vessel on her course, and they landed safely on  the coast of Elvira, near a sea-port town called Al-munékab (Almufiecar), in the  month of Rabi’-l-akhar of the year 138, according to Ibnu Hayyén, or in the three  first days of Rabi’-l-awal, according to other authorities. Immediately on his  landing, ’Abdu-r-rahm4n was met on the shore by the two chiefs of the conspiracy,  Abi ’Othmén and his son-in-law Abi Khaled, who conducted him to a town  called Torosh (Torrox), where Abi ’Othman was residing at the time.   According to other accounts, ’Abdu-r-rahman landed at the hour of ’asr [shortly  before sunset]; and the news of his disembarkation being speedily divulged among  his partisans, ’Abdullah and Abi ’Othmdén met him on the shore with great show  of consideration and respect. He then said his afternoon prayers with them, and  rode on to Torrox, where he made some stay: he was here met by the principal  maulis of his family and some Arabs, who took the oath of allegiance to him. How-  ever, no sooner was the news of ’Abdu-r-rahman’s disembarkation made known  through the country, than the people who were in the secret flocked to him from  all parts. The first man who arrived was Yusuf Ibn Bokht, who was the chief of  the Beni Umeyyah: next came Joddéran Ibn ’Amru Al-mad‘haji, who inhabited  Malaga, and who, in after-time, was appointed Kadi to the army ; and Abd ’Abdah  Hossén Ibn Malik Al-kelbi, whom ’Abdu-r-rahmdn named to the office of Wizir.  In this way the party waxed stronger day by day, and even moment by moment ;  and people flocked to his banners from every part of the country; God being  pleased to grant all His support to ’Abdu-r-rahman’s cause, until that prince was  enabled to gain possession of the capital, Cordova, within seven months, counting  from the day of his landing on the coast of Almufecar.    ae of Whilst these events were passing, Ytisuf Al-fehri, the governor of Andalus, was    in the Thagher (Aragon),® carrying on war against some chiefs who refused to  acknowledge his authority. He was, however, completely successful, defeating and  taking prisoners the leaders of the insurrection. These were Al-hobd4b Az-zohri,  who, as related, had risen in the neighbourhood of Saragossa, and ’A’mir Al-’abdari,  another chieftain who had likewise risen in arms against him. Having got rid of  his enemies in that quarter, Yiisuf hastened towards Toledo. Whilst he was  encamped at WAda-r-ramal (Guadarrama), near that city, he ordered the execution  of his prisoners, though he had solemnly promised to spare their lives, and caused  *A’mir Al-’abdari and his son to be beheaded. Yusuf is said to have done this  at the instigation of As-samil.",104,book_6,
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 67    They relate that as Yiisuf was entering his tent, after witnessing the execution of   his prisoners, a messenger arrived at full speed from his son ’Abdu-r-rahman, whom  he had left in command of Cordova during his absence, bearing news ‘“ how a  “youth, named ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ibn Mu’dwiyah, had lately landed on the shores  “occupied by the Syrian settlers, and had been immediately proclaimed by the  “‘ adherents and partisans of the family of Merw4n, who had flocked to him from  ‘all parts.” When the news spread through Yusuf’s camp, his men, who had  already disapproved the execution of ’A’mir and his son,—who belonged to the  illustrious tribe of Koraysh, and who, as above related, had been put to death,  notwithstanding his solemn promise to the contrary,—began openly to murmur,  and many decided upon deserting his banners that very night, and joining the  troops of the invader. Accordingly, in the depth of night, the chiefs having called  together their men, left the camp unperceived, the Almighty sending down a heavy Mpa in  rain, as if to cover the sound of their footsteps, and thereby disconcert the plans of :  Yusuf. When morning dawned, Yusuf found himself deserted by all except his  own personal friends and slaves, and the tribe of Kays, who remained faithful  to As-samil and his followers: seeing which, Yusuf marched immediately to  Toledo. Arrived there, he asked As-samil for his advice in their perilous situation.  “« My advice,” said As-samil to him, ‘‘ is that we march immediately upon ’Abdu-r-  ‘ rahman, so as not to give him time to strengthen himself; for I strongly suspect  ‘“‘ that the Yemeni Arabs will go over to him, owing to the hatred they openly  ‘“‘ bear to us, the Beni Modhar.” Ytisuf then answered, ‘‘ I agree with thee, O  ~ * As-samil! as to the expediency of what thou proposest ; but thou seemest to  “have forgotten that we have been deserted by most of our own followers, and  ‘* have at present no forces to march against the invader. We are, besides, without  “ either money or provisions; we have to march through a sterile and deserted  “country, in which hunger must be our lot. I propose going first to Cordova,  ‘‘ where we may get re-inforcements, and wait there for further news ; perhaps the  ‘* danger is not so great, nor the rising so formidable, as it has been represented.”  To which As-samil replied, ‘‘ Believe me, O Yusuf, mine is the best advice upon  ‘* this occasion: thou mayest act contrary to it; but, if thou dost, thou wilt in  ‘time discover thy error, and suffer from it.” Ytisuf, however, would not listen  to As-samil, and marched to Cordova.   *Abdu-r-rahmén in the mean while was not inactive. After passing some time ‘APdur-  at Elvira, where he soon found himself at the head of seven hundred horsemen, ane  of the best Arabian tribes, or of the maulis of his family, he left that city, and  repaired to the district of Rayyah, where his forces were considerably increased,  both the governor (’Isa Ibn Musdwid) and the inhabitants hastening to take the",105,book_6,
"    68 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    oath of allegiance, and proclaim him their sovereign. Thence he went to Shidinah,  where the governor, “It4b Ibn ’Alkamah Al-lakhmi, did the same; then to  Modrir ;° and from the latter place to Seville, where he was met by the chief of  the Yemeni Arabs, Abi-s-sabéh Ibn Yahya Al-yahssobi. ’Abdu-r-rahmdn then  summoned his friends to a council; and having heard their advice, it was unani-  mously resolved to march upon Cordova, the seat of the government. They say  that as they were halting at Toshinah (Tocina) on their way to that capital, it  occurred to them that they had neither banner nor colours by which they might be  guided on the field of battle. A long spear was immediately produced, and it was  proposed that a turban should be placed on the top of it; but as in order to effect  this it was necessary to incline the head of the spear, which was supposed by some  to be of extremely bad omen, the following expedient was devised: the spear  was placed erect between two olive-trees standing close together; a man was  then directed to ascend one of the trees, from the top of which he was enabled to  fasten the turban to the spear, without lowering it in the least. They relate also  that some time previous to this event, a learned man named Forkd4d, who was  gifted with the science of divination, happening to pass by the spot where the two  olive-trees stood, said, pointing to them, ‘‘ Between yonder two trees a banner  ‘* shall be erected for a prince, before whom no other banner shall ever wave  “ victorious.” The prophecy was fulfilled ; for with this same banner did ’Abdu-r-  rahmén and his son Hish4m vanquish their enemies wherever they met them, as  we shall have more than one opportunity to relate hereafter. They say that this  banner was held in such veneration and respect by the first sovereigns of that family  [Beni Umeyyah], that whenever the turban by long use decayed, it was not re-  moved, but a new one was placed over it. In this manner was the banner of the  Beni Umeyyah preserved until the days of the Sultén ’Abdu-r-rahmén, son of  Al-hakem, son of Hishdm, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ad-dékhel,—others say till  the days of his son Mohammed,—when the turban upon the spear being decayed,  the Wizirs of that monarch met together in council to deliberate upon its renewal.  Seeing nothing else under the decayed turban but a few rags twisted round the  spear, and not knowing that these had been long an object of veneration, they  issued orders for their removal. The whole was consequently removed, and thrown  away, and a fresh turban placed in its stead. It happened that Jehwar Ibn  Ydsuf Ibn Bokht, then the chief Wizir, and president of the council, but who  was absent during the deliberation, arrived in Cordova the day after the mischief  was done. Having inquired into the case, he gave his brother Wizirs a most severe  reprimand for their ignorance and their hasty decision: he said to them, “ Since  “ you have through your imprudence caused the loss of the good omen attached to",106,book_6,
"    CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 69    “ that banner, it is but just that you should consult with the elders of our nation  ‘as to the best means of repairing the mischief done: go, and tell them your case.”  The Wizirs went, and the rags were carefully looked for; but they could nowhere  be found. When the Sultén was made acquainted with the loss, he was much  grieved; and as his armies, always victorious, met after that event with severe  defeats, it was thought at the time that these disasters were chiefly to be attri-  buted to the loss of the banner. ‘“ From that time,” remarks the judicious  historian Ibnu Hayydn, ‘‘ the empire of the Beni Umeyyah began visibly to  decline.” It is generally asserted that the man who ascended the olive-tree for the  purpose of crowning the spear was ’Abdullah Ibn Khaled, one of the maulis of the  Beni Umeyyah established in Andalus, whose father, Khaled, had likewise crowned  the banner of Merwén Ibn Al-hakem, the grandfather of ’Abdu-r-rahman I., when,  after the overthrow of the dynasty of the Beni Harb, he was joined by the Beni  Umeyyah and the Beni Kelb, to make war against Adh-dhahhak Ibn Kays Al-fehri,  who was afterwards defeated and put to death at the battle of Merj-Réhitt. They  say also that the keeping of this banner was first intrusted to Abii Suleymaén Datd  Al-anséri, in whose posterity the charge remained until the days of the Amir  Mohammed, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmaén II., when, as related, it was irretrievably  lost.   But to resume the thread of our interrupted narrative. On the approach of  *Abdu-r-rahman to Cordova, Yiisuf went out to meet him. There had been a  famine in Andalus for six consecutive years, so that the people were greatly  debilitated from want of food. Since their departure from Seville, the common  soldiers in ’Abdu-r-rahmén’s host had subsisted merely upon the herbs and plants  which they found on the road, the officers and rich men not faring much better.  It was then spring-time, and the year in which this happened was ever after-  wards called ’dmu-l-khalaf,° i. e. ‘ the year after the famine.’ The Guadalquivir  too was considerably swollen, and in some districts had overflowed its banks.  Yiuisuf then marched from Cordova, and ’Abdu-r-rahmdén came down from Seville,  until they met each other at a place where the Guadalquivir separated the two  hosts. Thence ’Abdu-r-rahm4n continued his march up to Cordova, following  the right bank of the river, which being perceived by Yusuf, this governor re-  traced his steps, and returned to his capital by the opposite bank, watching at  the same time all the movements of his adversary. In this manner both armies  proceeded until Yusuf pitched his tents in the plain of Musdrah,""' west of Cordova,  where ’Abdu-r-rahmén also encamped in front of him. Negotiations then com-  menced, and messengers crossed from one camp to the other, with a view to",107,book_6,

Yvtisuf had given orders to slaughter  some sheep, and make a display of their flesh, meaning it, no doubt, as an insult  to the son of Mu’déwiyah, whose followers, as we have already observed, were almost  starved for want of food. ’*Abdu-r-rahm4n, however, made every preparation for  the coming contest: he caused his men to keep in readiness with their arms,  and he himself passed all night awake, to see that his orders were punctually  executed.   They relate that Yusuf was the first who made proposals of peace to ’Abdu-r-  rahman, who feigned to accept of them, and thus gained two days, the last of  which was the day of ’Arefah of the year 138 (May 14, a. p. 756). Under this  belief, ’Abdu-r-rahman’s men passed the night preceding the ‘festival of the  victims ;’ but ’Abdu-r-rahmdén thought differently in his heart from what he affected  in public, and he consequently took every measure to ensure the success of the  approaching contest: he also gave orders that Khaled Ibn Zeyd, Yusuf’s secretary,    who was at the time in his camp, whither he had been sent with a message from    his master, should be kept a prisoner. ‘‘ If we are defeated,” he added, “‘let him  “be put to death; if we vanquish, spare his life.” So that Khdled kept saying  the night before the battle, ‘‘ There is nothing I wish for more ardently at this  “ moment than to see the troops of my master put to flight by those of ’Abdu-r-  “ rahmdn Ad-dakhel.” .   When the morning of the day of the victims dawned, ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, at the  head of his cavalry, made a sudden attack upon the camp of his rival. They say  that ’Abdu-r-rahman was that day mounted on a beautiful steed ; upon which some  of the Yemeni Arabs said to each other, ‘‘ Look at our youthful general; he is  “‘ mounted on a swift-footed animal, the better to fly from the field of battle. Who  ‘* can assure us that he will not turn back at the first onset, and leave us to fight the  ‘battle ourselves?’ ’Abdu-r-rahmén having been informed of this by one of his  maulis, rode up to Abt-s-sabéh, the chief of the Yemeni Arabs, who was mounted  on a grey mule called Kaukab (lightning), and addressed him thus: ‘“‘O Abi-s-  ‘‘sabéh! this horse of mine is in the habit of rearing under me, so that it is  “ very difficult for me to keep my saddle. I wish to make an exchange with  “thee; give me that excellent and quiet mule of thine, and take my spirited  “horse.” Abii-s-sabéh did as he was desired by ’Abdu-r-rahmén, who by this act  dissipated the suspicions of his followers. They relate likewise that some time  previous to the general engagement ’Abdu-r-rahman rode before the ranks, and  asked his men, ‘‘ What day is this ?”’—‘‘ Thursday, the day of ’Arefah,” answered  they. ‘‘ Well, then, mark my words,” replied ’Abdu-r-rahman, ‘‘ To-morrow is",108,book_6,

It is even said that there was a  still closer coincidence. At the battle of Merj-Rdahitt there were only three men  of the tribe of Kays serving under the orders of Merwdn; namely, ’Abdullah Ibn  Masédah Al-fez4ri, Ibn Hobeyrah Al-moh4ribi, and Séleh Al-ghinawwi: at the battle  of Musdrah there were likewise only three men of the tribe of Kays serving under  *Abdu-r-rahmén ; namely, Jabir Ibnu-l-’ala Ibn Sheha&b and Al-hossayn Ibnu-d-  dajen, both belonging to the tribe of ’Okayl, and Heldl Ibnu-t-tofayl Al-’abdari.""*  After some hard fighting on both sides, victory declared for ’Abdu-r-rahman. Yisuf  was the first to give way; As-samil and his followers valiantly kept their ground  until all hopes of recovering the day were gone. They say that when As-samil saw  that his men were losing courage, he spurred on a grey mule which he rode, and  plunged into the middle of the enemy’s ranks, with a view of coming, if possible, to  close combat with ’Abdu-r-rahmén. As he was approaching the spot where that  prince fought, Abi ’Att4 came up to him and said, ‘‘ O Abi Jaushan! thou hadst  “« better spare thyself for another occasion ; this is an ominous day, and every thing  “‘ must needs go wrong for us. Mark the coincidence: to-day is Friday, and so was  “ the day of Merj-Rahitt ; the warriors on both sides are the same; Umeyyah and  ‘the sons of Yemen against the tribes of Fehr, Kays, and Kelb. By Allah! I  “believe in truth that this day will turn out as unlucky for us as the day of  “ Merj-Réhitt.""—“‘ O Abi ’Atté!’’ answered As-samil, “ thou art an eminent  “man, and thy learning is, no doubt, great; but on this occasion despondency  ‘« preys on thy mind, and thy reason is clouded by fear:” saying which he rushed  forward, whilst Abi ’Att4 turned bridle and fled. As-samil, however, was defeated,  and his followers put to flight.   Such is the account of this memorable battle as it has been handed down by histo-  rians. ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ad-dékhel obtained a most complete victory, and the field  was strewn with the bodies of the enemy. Among the prisoners of the day was  *Abdu-r-rahmén, one of Ytisuf’s sons, and other distinguished individuals. As-samil",109,book_6,

They relate that immediately  after this defeat Abti-s-sabéh, the chief of the Arabs of Yemen, addressed his  followers in these words: ‘‘ O men, let our victory this day be complete; we have  “ annihilated the party of Yusuf and As-samil; let us put to death this beardless  ‘*‘ youth, I mean the son of Mu’4wiyah, our present commander. If we do, the  “ empire is ours, and we may then appoint one of ourselves to the command of this  “‘ country, and be for ever rid of the Beni Modhar.” Thus spoke Abi-s-sabd4h,  but not one of those who heard him made reply; on the contrary, his words were  reported to ’Abdu-r-rahmén, who kept them in his heart, until a year afterwards,  seeing a favourable opportunity, he seized him, and had him executed.   After Yisuf’s defeat, ’Abdu-r-rahmén marched his victorious army to Cordova,  which city he entered after remaining for three days encamped outside, that he  might allow the family of Yusuf time to quit the palace.""* He also showed his  generosity and clemency by pardoning all those who had taken up arms against  him. After spending a few days in the capital, ’Abdu-r-rahmén received intel-  ligence how the partisans of Yusuf and As-samil, after collecting the relics of their  army in the neighbourhood of Granada, were again preparing to attack him, and he  therefore resolved to go out in pursuit of them. Before his departure, however, he  appointed Abi ’Othmdn, who, as before related, was the principal instrument of  his success, to be governgr of Cordova in his absence, and gave him Umeyyah Ibn  Zeyyéd to act as his secretary. This Umeyyah had formerly held the same office  under Yusuf; but, being a mauli of the Beni Umeyyah, ’Abdu-r-rahman granted  him his pardon, and confirmed him in his appointment. These arrangements being  taken, ’Abdu-r-rahman started in pursuit of the enemy, though not without leaving  behind him a considerable body of troops to guard the capital in his absence.  It happened, however, that as he was marching to overtake Yusuf, that general  manceuvred so well as to place himself between *Abdu-r-rahmén and Cordova,  whence, by dint of forced marches, he suddenly appeared before that capital, which  he entered without resistance, as well as the palace of the governor, Abi Othman,  who, with the garrison, threw himself hastily into the tower of the great mosque.  He was there besieged by Ytisuf, who offered him security for himself and his  followers, if he would surrender. Abi ’Othmén refused, and maintained himself  until a peace was concluded between his master and Yusuf in the month of Safar of  the year 139 (July, a.p. 756). The treaty, which included also Yiisuf’s late Wizir,  As-samil, stipulated that the two chieftains should be left in the undisturbed  possession of whatever property they might have at the time; that Yusuf should",110,book_6,

To insure the fulfilment of these conditions, Yusuf was to give as  hostages his sons Abi-l-aswad Mohammed and ’Abdu-r-rahman, the latter of  whom, as before related, was made prisoner at the battle of Musdrah. This treaty  being ratified and peace concluded, both armies returned to Cordova.    VOL. Il. L",111,book_6,

In the preceding Book we gave a rapid sketch of the victories of the Moslems  and their conquest of Andalus, and of the power which they wielded in that  country until the arrival of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ad-dakhel, the sovereign under whose  sway the consolidation of the Mohammedan empire was achieved, and the pre-  ponderance of the Yemenite faction [over the Beni Modhar] fully established, as  we shall hereafter relate, if God be pleased.   Ibn Hazm and others describe the dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah of Andalus as  the most powerful and glorious of the Mohammedan dynasties ; the most afflicting  to the enemies of God, and that which gained most renown; since, as it will be  shown in the course of this narrative, none other surpassed it in the number and  importance of its victories.   We have given elsewhere a detailed account of the adventures of ’Abdu-r-rahmaén  Ibn Mu’éwiyah, of his wanderings through Africa, and of the many dangers to  which he was exposed before he could land in Andalus, and establish therein the  supremacy of his family; but for the sake of information, and in order to throw  more light over this our narrative, we shall here condense the facts already re-  corded.   According to Ibnu Khaldin and other historians, the dynasty of the Beni    ",112,book_6,
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 75    Umeyyah of Andalus originated thus: In the year 132 of the Hijra (beginning  August 19, a. pv. 749), the Beni ’Abbdés overpowered the Beni Umeyyah, and  gained possession of the Khalifate. After “Abdullah Ibn ’Ali, the uncle of As-  sefféh, had put to death Merwdn Ibn Mohammed Ibn Merwén Ibn Al-hakem,  the last Khalif of that dynasty, the sons of Umeyyah were every where pursued  for slaughter, and both the surface and the bowels of the earth were scrupulously  searched for them. Among those who fled [to escape from their enemies] was  ’Abdu-r-rahman, son of Mu’awiyah, son of Hish4m, son of ’Abdu-l-malek, son of  Merwéan, for whom the partisans and friends of the Beni Umeyyah were preparing  an empire in the West, as they saw in him certain signs indicative of his success,  which had been prognosticated by his uncle, Moslemah Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek. ’Abdu-r-  rahmén himself, who had heard from the lips of Moslemah that he would be the  avenger of his family, having upon one occasion entered the presence of his grand-  father Hishém, found his uncle, Moslemah Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, sitting in the room  with him. ’Abdu-r-rahmdn being then an infant, Hish4m gave orders that he  should be taken out of the room. But Moslemah interfered, and, pressing the  child to his bosom, said to his brother, ‘‘ Let him stay, O Commander of the  “ Faithful! and be kind to him; for he will become in time the avenger of the  ‘* Beni Umeyyah,' and the restorer of their empire.”—‘‘ From that time,” said  *Abdu-r-rahmaén (from whom this anecdote is borrowed), ‘‘ my grandfather always  “treated me with the greatest kindness and distinction.” Encouraged by these  prognostics, with which he never failed to acquaint his friends, ’Abdu-r-rahmén  fled to the West, and took up his abode among the Nefezah, a Berber tribe of  Tripoli, to whom his mother Radha belonged. However, Ibn Habib hearing of  his being there, he removed to Maghilah; others say to Mekenésah (Mequinez) ;  others, to a district inhabited by Berbers of the tribe of Zendtah, who treated him  kindly, and among whom he was secure. Thence ’Abdu-r-rahmdn went to Melilah  (Melilla). It was from this place that he sent over to Andalus his freedman Bedr,  to stir the adherents of his family to revolt against Yusuf Al-fehri, the governor who  held the command of that country.  No sooner was ’Abdu-r-rahman firmly seated on the throne, than he dispatched ‘Abtu-+-    rahman invites  emissaries to Syria, Egypt, and other Mohammedan countries, with instructions to He Beni    find out the surviving members of his family, and invite them to settle in his ete A  dominions. Accordingly several individuals, or adherents, of the proscribed race of  Umeyyah, who had hitherto lain concealed from the spies of Al-manstir [Abii  Ja’far], hastened to obey his summons, and arrived in Andalus, where ’Abdu-r-  rahmén received them with every mark of attention and respect. As the names    of all those who entered Andalus on this occasion have been preserved by many",113,book_6,
"    Names of those  who left the  East.    76 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vI.    diligent historians, we shall extract from their works such passages as are calcu-  lated to throw light on this interesting subject.   “‘ During the reign of this Sultén,” says one, ‘“ numbers of illustrious Moslems  ‘* quitted the land of their fathers, and settled in Andalus. Several of the Beni  “* Merwdn too, encouraged by the success of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, flocked to him from  “the East. A contemporary writer has said, ‘When Ad-dakhel saw himself firmly  ‘* seated on the throne, he bestirred himself to collect around him the relics of his  “ family, and, having dispatched emissaries for that purpose, succeeded in bringing  ‘to Cordova several of the relatives and adherents of his family. God Almighty  “« was pleased to assist him in the undertaking, and to permit that he should extend  ‘* over them the hand of protection.’ ”   Alluding to this, the historian Al-hij4ri has said, ‘‘ ’Abdu-r-rahman was in the  ‘* habit of saying to his courtiers, ‘Among the many favours bestowed on us by  “the Almighty, the greatest, after making us the master of this empire, is his  ‘* allowing us to collect in this country our kindred and relatives, and enabling  ‘** us to give them a share in this empire, which we hold through his interference.  “‘ There is no power or strength but in God! His is the empire!’ ”   In this manner there came to Andalus a brother of ’Abdu-r-rahmdén, named  Al-walid Ibn Mu’awiyah ; two sons of the Khalif Hisham Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek ; a  cousin of his named ’Abdu-s-sell4m Ibn Yezid Ibn Hisham; and two nephews,  Al-mugheyrah Ibn Al-walid and ’Obeydullah? Ibn Abén Ibn Mu’dwiyah. There  came, besides, ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn ""Omar, Abi Suleymén Foteys Ibn Suleyman,  *Abdu-l-malek Ibn Bashar, Habib Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, and many others, to all of  whom he gave pensions and lands, as well as command in his armies, and govern-  ment in the provinces, by which means his empire was strengthened, and he was  enabled to subdue all his enemies.   Among the above-named individuals, ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn ’Omar was the one who  contributed most powerfully to the consolidation of ’Abdu-r-rahman’s power. He  was the son of Omar, and the grandson of the Khalif Merwin Ibn Al-hakem.  His father ""Omar had, when young, been intrusted to the care of his own brother  ’Abdu-l-’aziz, governor of Egypt, where he resided until his death. When the  bearers of the black colours (’Abbassides) appeared in Syria, ’Abdu-l-malek, who  was residing in that country, fled to Egypt; but not considering himself secure  there, he took his departure, accompanied by ten men®* of his own family, and  arrived in Andalus, where he found his relative ’Abdu-r-rahm4n already seated on  the throne. This was in the year 140 (beginning May 24, a.p. 757). ’Abdu-r-  rahmdn honoured and distinguished him greatly: knowing that he had filled offices  of trust under the Khalifs of his family, he gave him the government of Seville, and",114,book_6,
"    cHaP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 77    appointed also one of his sons, named ’Omar, to that of Morér. They relate of  this ’Abdu-l-malek, that when he perceived that notwithstanding the separation of  Andalus from the Eastern empire, it was still the custom to say the khotbah for  Abi Ja’far Al-mansiir in all the mosques, he advised ’Abdu-r-rahmaén to have the  name of that Khalif omitted in the public prayers, and brought to his recollection  all the injuries which the Beni Umeyyah had sustained from the Beni ’Abbas.  At first, ""Abdu-r-rahman would not listen to his advice, and the prayers continued  as before; but, on ’Abdu-l-malek insisting strongly, he at last gained his object.  They say that as ’Abdu-r-rahman upon a certain occasion refused to accede to his  entreaties on the subject, ’Abdu-l-malek said to him, “ If thou refuse to comply  ‘“‘ with my request, O Amir! and allow Al-manstir’s name to be mentioned in the  “« prayers, I will certainly destroy myself.” Upon which, ’Abdu-r-rahman, moved  by his determination, and not choosing to lose so zealous a servant, granted his  request ; and from that day the Khalif’s name was no longer proclaimed from the  pulpits, as it had been during the first ten months of his reign.   This ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Omar was an excellent poet. Seeing one day at Seville  a solitary palm-tree, which brought to his recollection the place of his birth in  Syria, and the friends he had left there, he exclaimed, in a fit of irrepressible  sorrow,—   “O palm-tree! like myself, thou art alone in this land; thou also art  ‘* away from thy kindred.   “Thou weepest, and closest the calix of thy flowers. Why? dost thou  “lament the generating seed scattered on the mountain ?   “Yes, I do; for although they all may take root in a congenial soil [like  ‘* that] watered by the Euphrates,   “Yet orphans are they all; since the Beni ’Abbdés have driven me away  “* from my family.” *   Another of the Beni Umeyyah was Jazi Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz, brother of the Khalif  *Omar Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz. He went to Andalus, and settled there. He died before  ’Abdu-r-rahmén, and was a virtuous and exemplary man, following in most things  the steps of his brother the Khalif.   Among the illustrious individuals who settled in Andalus under this reign may be  counted Abi-l-ash’ath Al-kelbi, who was far advanced in age when he arrived in  Cordova. This man preserved traditions from his mother, who held them herself  from ’A’yeshah. (May God’s favour be on her!) He became a great favourite  with ’Abdu-r-rahm4n, who admitted him to his privacy; and he was generally  esteemed for his amiable temper and his virtues: he had, however, one great fault,  namely, that of being somewhat fond of turning men and things into ridicule, and",115,book_6,
"    78 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    indulging in jests. The following is given as an instance: When the Sultén  *Abdu-r-rahman heard of the death of Habib® Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn ’Omar Ibn  Al-walid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn Merwdn, who had been his most intimate friend,  and for whom he always showed more deference than for any other member of his  family, he began to weep, and to implore the Almighty to forgive the sins of the  deceased. Abii-l-ash’ath, who was standing by the side of the Sultan when Habib’s  death was announced, and whose jests ’Abdu-r-rahman was in the habit of bearing  with extreme patience and good humour, said aloud, and as if he were addressing  the deceased,—‘‘ O Abt Suleymdén! thou hast descended to the grave, and it  “was not until thou wast comfortably lodged there that the Khalif began his  “ lamentations.” Hearing which, ’Abdu-r-rahman, who could scarcely suppress  the smile on his lips, turned round, and went away. The preceding anecdote is  related by the historian Ibnu Hayydn in his Muktabis, as well as byt the Hafedh  Tbnu-l-abb4r, who borrowed it from him.   Rebellion of We have said elsewhere that a treaty was concluded between ’Abdu-r-rahmaén  and Yiisuf, in virtue of which the latter was to reside in Cordova. It was not  long, however, before Yusuf infringed the conditions he had agreed to observe.  In the year 141 (beginning May 13, a.p. 758) he left Cordova secretly, and,  putting himself at the head of his numerous followers, tried to raise the country  against ’Abdu-r-rahmdn. According to the historian Ibnu Hayydn, this happened  thus: It appears that Ytisuf was possessed of considerable property in land in  the neighbourhood of Cordova, which he was enabled to retain by one of the  articles in the above-mentioned treaty. Some people, however, having disputed  with him the title by which he held some of his estates, they went before the  magistrates, who decided in favour of the claimants and against Yusuf. When the  sentence was communicated to that chief, he complained bitterly of the injustice,  and uttered some strong expressions against the son of Mu’awiyah; which being  speedily reported to that monarch by the enemies of Ytisuf, led to a misunder-  standing between them. At last Ydsuf, fearing for his life, secretly left Cordova,  and retired to Merida,® where he had numerous partisans, and was soon sur-  rounded by twenty thousand adventurers from all parts of the country. His  power having gradually increased, Yusuf flattered himself that he could success-  fully contend against the arms of Ibn Mu’d4wiyah; who was no sooner acquainted  with Ytisuf’s movements, than he gave orders to his generals to attack the rebels,  whilst he himself went out of Cordova with a powerful army, and took up his  quarters at Hisnu-l-mudowwar (Almodovar), a town at some distance from that  capital. In the mean while, ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn ""Omar Ibn Merwdn, who was  governor of Seville, had gone in pursuit of the rebels with all the forces he could",116,book_6,
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 79    muster. He met Ytisuf, with whom he had several sharp encounters, until at His defeat and  last he completely defeated him, killing most of his men, and putting the remainder death  to flight. Yvisuf, however, contrived to make his escape, and reached the neigh-  bourhood of Toledo; but, whilst he was in one of the villages of that district,  he was met by a man named ’Abdullah Ibn ’Amru Al-ansdri, who, having recog-  nised him, said to those who were with him, ‘‘ This is no doubt the Fehrite [Yusuf],  “‘ who has taken refuge among us because the country is against him. To kill  “ him would be a service to him and to this country ;” saying which, he dealt him  _ a blow with his sword, and stretched him dead at his feet: after this he cut  off his head, which he carried to ’Abdu-r-rahman, who, on his return to Cordova,  ordered that the event should be announced to the inhabitants by the public crier,  and that the head of Yusuf should be nailed under the central arch of the bridge.  He then ordered ’Abdu-r-rahmén, the son of Ytisuf, to be beheaded, and his head  to be placed beside that of his father ; which order was punctually obeyed, the heads  of the father and son being placed on two spears under the gate of the royal palace.  Thus the governor Yusuf ended his days, after having been in command of Andalus  for a period of upwards of nine years. He was the son of ’Abdu-r-rahmén, son of  Habib, son of Abi ’Obeydah, and the great-grandson of ’Okbah Ibn Naf’ Al-  fehri, the founder of Cairwd4n, who, during the Khalifate of Mu’awiyah Ibn Abi  Sufydn, had been governor of the Mohammedan conquests in Eastern and Western  Africa.   As to his Wizir, As-samil, he soon shared a similar fate. No sooner was the  flight of Yusuf discovered, than he was arrested and thrown into a dungeon. He,  was afterwards summoned to the presence of ’Abdu-r-rahmadn, who interrogated  him as to the place whither Yusuf had gone. ‘I do not know,” answered As-  samil. ‘‘ Well, then,” replied ’Abdu-r-rahmaén, ‘thou shalt remain in prison  “until thou dost know. Thy son was seen in his company before he was missed,  “and I make thee responsible for his re-appearance.”—‘‘ Thou mayest do thy  ‘* worst,” retorted As-samil, ‘‘ but, were Yusuf here under my foot, I would not  “« raise it to give thee the opportunity of seizing on him.” Hearing this, ’Abdu-r-  rahman caused him to be cast into a dungeon, together with the two sons of Yusuf,  Abi-l-aswad Mohammed, afterwards called Al-’amt (the blind), and ’Abdu-r-  rahmaén. These latter, however, succeeded some time afterwards in bribing some  of their guards, who procured them the means of escaping from prison. Abi-l-  aswad fled to the provinces, where he excited a rebellion against his sovereign,  and maintained himself until he died of a natural death in 169 (beginning July 13,  a.p. 785. ’Abdu-r-rahmén was not so successful: being a very corpulent man,",117,book_6,

They say that As-samil, who was in prison with them, obtained intelligence  of their plans of escape, but would not follow them, and remained. However,  after the death of Yusuf, ’Abdu-r-rahman sent some people, who strangled As-samil  in prison, and he was found dead on the following morning. Others say that he was  poisoned, and that one day as the Sheikhs of the Beni Modhar went to see him in  his prison, they found him a corpse, having close by his side a cup,’ as if he  had been drinking; upon which one of the beholders exclaimed, ‘‘ By Allah!  “O Abi-l-jaushan, we need not be told that thou drankest the potion; but there  ‘* can be no doubt either as to the hand that administered it.” As-samil was the son  of Hatim, son of Shimr, son of Dhi-jaushan ; others make him the son of Hétim,  son of ’Amri, son of Junda’, son of Ash-shimr, son of Dhi-jaushan. His ancestor,  Ash-shimr, had been one of the most illustrious citizens of Kufah, and one of the  murderers ® of Huseyn Ibn Abi Talib (may God be favourable to him!). As to  As-samil, he entered Andalus in the suite of Balj Ibn Beshr, with other noble  Syrians and Arabians. He had previously fought in the Maghreb (Western Africa)  against the Berbers, at the orders of Kolthtim Ibn ’Iyddh, then governor of the  Mohammedan settlements in Africa. He distinguished himself by his bravery and  his experience in military affairs. To these qualities he owed his rapid promotion  in the army, and the great favour he always enjoyed with Yusuf, who intrusted  to him the command of his armies.   As-samil was a tolerably good poet, but an uneducated man, and could not  write: he was very fond of intoxicating liquors, and was often inebriated. Notwith-  standing these faults, he obtained the command of the Arabs in Andalus; for,  although Ytsuf was nominally their Sultén, he was completely the master of  that chieftain, over whose mind he exercised the greatest influence. As-samil  obtained the command at the same time with Yusuf, in the year 129: he retained  it until it passed into the hands of the Beni Umeyyah, whose empire ceased not  to increase in extent and strength until the fourth century of the Hijra, when  their empire was overthrown, and their power vanished away, as did that of other  mighty dynasties which preceded it. Thus are the immutable decrees of the  Almighty irrevocably fulfilled on his creatures. God is great! God is great!  There is no God but him, the merciful, the compassionate !   In the year 146 (beginning March 20, a.p. 763), Al-’ala Ibn Mughith Al-  yahssobi sailed from Eastern Africa with a view to re-establish the supremacy of  the Beni ’Abbds, and to plant their black banners in Andalus.

Having called upon the inhabitants of that city and the surrounding  districts to aid him in his undertaking, great multitudes answered his call, and  he soon saw himself surrounded by considerable forces, with which he began to  molest all those who remained faithful to the cause of the Beni Umeyyah. No  sooner was ’Abdu-r-rahman informed of his landing, than he hastily collected  some troops and marched against him: he overtook him in the neighbourhood  of Seville, whither Ibn Mughith had marched in the hope of reducing that  wealthy city; and a battle ensuing, the victory remained on the side of ’Abdu-r-  rahman; Mughith himself, and most of his officers, falling into his hands.  Having ordered the execution of all his prisoners, the victorious monarch caused  their heads to be secretly conveyed to Cairwin and Mekka, and to be cast  at night into the squares and principal streets of those two cities, together  with the black banners of the ’Abbdssides, and the dispatches and credentials  which Ibn Mughith had brought with him from Abi Ja’far Al-mansir. Another  account says that when the unfortunate general was brought into the presence  of ’Abdu-r-rahman, that monarch ordered first the hands of his enemy to be cut  off, and then his feet; he then had him beheaded, together with the principal Is defeated and  chiefs of the insurrection. In order the better to strike terror into his enemies, aS  *Abdu-r-rahman caused labels, inscribed with the names of the deceased, to be  suspended from their ears; their heads were then stored in sealed bags, together  with the black banners of the house of ’Abbds, and the whole given to a trusty  merchant, who was directed to convey his cargo to Mekka, and deposit it in public  places at a certain time. The merchant did as he was ordered. It happened  that Abi Ja’far Al-manstr, the reigning Khalif, by whose orders the expedition  had been undertaken, was in Mekka at the time, whither he had gone on pil-  grimage, and the bags were secretly placed at the door of his tent. When the  guards saw them in the morning, the circumstance was communicated to Al-  manstir, who immediately opened them himself, when lo! the first thing that  met his eye was the gory head of his trusty servant Ibn Mughith: he then  broke out into maledictions against ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, and exclaimed, ‘ The fate  ‘“‘ of this unfortunate man (meaning Ibn Mughith) sufficiently discloses to.us the  “‘ wicked. intentions of that demon. God be praised for placing a sea between  “us!”   Owing to this occurrence, Al-manstr always bore ’Abdu-r-rahman great hatred,  and never failed, as long as he lived, to do him all the harm he could, by causing  inroads to be made into his dominions, and stirring up the Arabs of Andalus to   VOL. 11.

Yet Al-mansdr, though he hated him so intensely, would often speak of  him in the highest terms, extolling his sagacity and his prudence, and doing justice  to his military talents. He used to call him Sakru-i-koraysh® (the hawk of Koraysh),  on account of his deeds in Andalus, the many dangers he had escaped on his  way to that country from the East, and the rapidity with which, though desti-  tute of resources, and with only a handful of followers, he had snatched so mighty  an empire out of his hands, and transmitted it as an inheritance to his posterity.  Upon one occasion he told his courtiers, ‘‘Do not wonder at the dimensions  “and strength of this our empire; what is really wonderful is the enterprise,  ‘‘ wisdom, and prudence displayed by the youth of Koraysh; when, destitute of  “« friends as he was, he hesitated not to thrust himself into the paths of perdition,  ‘* and to invade a distant island, difficult of access, and defended by a well appointed  “army. See how, profiting by the feuds and enmities of the rival tribes, he has  ‘“* caused them to rise in arms against one another; how, by prudence and good  “ government he has gradually gained the hearts of his subjects and quelled their  ‘“‘ rebellious spirit; how, in short, he has overcome every difficulty, and made  “himself sole master of the country.”   A very striking resemblance has been pointed out as existing between ’Abdu-r-  rahman and his contemporary and rival, Abi Ya’kib Al-mansir, of the house of  *Abbds. Both were equally distinguished for prudence, vigour, and talents for  administration ; both displayed the same energy in humbling the pride, and the  same unflinching severity in chastising the rebellions of their subjects. They had  yet other points of resemblance: both their mothers were natives of Barbary, and  each of them put to death his own nephew; since, as is well known, Al-mansir  killed the son of his brother As-seffah, and ’Abdu-r-rahman ordered the execution  of Al-mugheyrah Ibn Al-walid Ibn Mu’dwiyah. But to return.   In the year 151 (beginning Jan. 26, a.p. 768,) there was another revolt !°  against ’Abdu-r-rahmén. The rebels, having mustered in large numbers, marched  against the capital. This intelligence being brought to ’Abdu-r-rahmdan, orders were  sent to ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Omar, the governor of Seville, immediately to attack  the enemy. ’Abdu-l-malek, after giving Umeyyah,"" one of his sons, the command  of the yan, marched against the rebels. In this manner Umeyyah suddenly came  up with the enemy ; but finding their numbers too great, and not daring to engage  them, he fell back upon his father’s army. When ’Abdu-l-malek saw his son thus  flying before the rebels, his indignation was roused to the highest pitch, and he  said to him, ‘‘ How camest thou, O coward, thus to abandon the post intrusted to  “‘ thy care? The people of Andalus and Africa know how we came hither to escape  “ from death, but thou meetest it :’’ saying which, he ordered him to be beheaded ;",120,book_6,
"    CHAP. II.) DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 83    which was’ done. He then called together his friends and relatives, and said to  them, ‘‘ Are we come from the East to the extreme limits of these regions ; and  ‘* have we gone through so many dangers and privations, to be now so sparing of  ‘* the few sparkles of life which still remain in our bodies? Let us throw away the  ‘“ scabbards of our good swords, and perish rather than be vanquished.” Thus  saying, he placed himself at the head of his troops, and charged the enemy with  great determination. The people of Seville,!? and the Arabs of Yemen, were com-  pletely defeated : so great was their loss on this occasion, that they never afterwards  recovered the blow. Thirty thousand bodies on both sides remained on the field  of battle, and ’Abdu-l-malek himself was severely wounded. When ’Abdu-r-  rahmdn, who came up after the battle, heard of the exploits achieved by his  trusty relative, and saw the blood ooze from his wounds and drop from his  sword, the hilt of which actually clave to the palm of his hand, he rewarded  him most munificently, and said to him, ‘“‘ O cousin! I have ordered my son  “and heir Hishim to marry one of thy daughters,'* to whom I will give so much  “ out of my treasury as dowry. I likewise give thee so much, and thy sons so  “much; I give thee and thy sons such a castle and such a town, and appoint  ** thee besides to the office of Wizir.”   In the year 163 (beginning Sept. 16, a. p. 779), according to Ibnu Hayyan, pana  ’Abdu-r-rahmén put to death ’Abdu-s-sellém Ibn Yezid Ibn Hishdm,' better ‘Abdur.  known by his patronymic Al-yezidi. He likewise ordered the execution of his covered.  own nephew, ’Obeydullah Ibn Abén Ibn Mu’dwiyah Ibn Hishdm. It appears  that these two individuals, with many others, had entered into a conspiracy to  dethrone ’Abdu-r-rahmdn. A mauli of ’Obeydullah, who was in the secret, and  had assisted in their plans, discovered them to ’Abdu-r-rahmén, who immediately  caused the guilty parties to be arrested, and sentenced them to death. Abi  *Othmén, his chief Wizir, was likewise in the conspiracy; but ’Abdu-r-rahmdan,  grateful for his past services, spared his life.   In the year 167 (beginning Aug. 4, a. p. 783), says Ibn Hazm, another of  ’*Abdu-r-rahman’s nephews, whose name was Al-mugheyrah Ibn Al-walid Ibn  Mu’4wiyah, was put to death on the charge of having formed a conspiracy to Execution of L  dethrone his uncle. The same fate befel Hudheyl Ibn As-samil Ibn Hatim. His mugheyrah.  own brother, Al-walid, Al-mugheyrah’s father, he exiled to the opposite coast of  Africa, though he gave him permission to take with him his sons, family, and  treasures. It is said in the Mas’hab that on the day in which ’Abdu-r-rahmén  ordered the execution of his nephew, one of the favourite maulis of that monarch  entered his presence, and found him absorbed in thought, and with signs of deep  sorrow on his countenance.

But God has chastised their ingratitude by permitting us to pry  “into their secrets, and by turning against them the blows which they aimed  “at us.” .   In this same year (a. H. 167) ’Abdu-r-rahman made known his intention to  march to Syria at the head of his army, and take the empire from the Beni  ’*Abbés. He accordingly began to make every preparation, and wrote to his  relatives, maulis, and partisans of his house, apprising them of his determination.  He was to leave his eldest son, Suleyman, to command in Andalus in his absence,  whilst he himself, at the head of his troops, was to invade Syria. However, the  rebellion of Huseyn Al-ansdri, who rose about this time at Saragossa, disconcerted  his plans, and frustrated his purposes.   Besides the above rebels, ’Abdu-r-rahman had to reduce many others of the  principal Arabian tribes, who, during his reign, rose in various parts of his do-  minions, although God was pleased to render him victorious over every one of  them. In their number may be counted a Berber who passed himself off as a  descendant of Fatimah,'® the daughter of the Prophet. ‘This man raised the  standard of revolt at the town of Santa Maria, and the mischief lasted for two  years, until one of his own followers treacherously slew him.   Hayyat'® Ibn Muldébis Al-hadhrami, governor of Seville, ’Abdu-l-ghaffar Ibn  Hamid Al-yohssebi, governor of Niebla, and ’Amrié Ibn Tahit, governor of Beja,  are also counted among the Arabian chieftains who opposed the authority of  ’Abdu-r-rahman, and rose in arms against him. After the death of Abii-s-sabah,  the chief of the Yemeni Arabs, whom ’Abdu-r-rahmén, as above related, caused  to be executed,” the three illustrious individuals just named swore to revenge  the murder of their friend; and having collected the troops of their respective  governments, marched upon Cordova. But they were met by the troops of the  Sultan, and defeated with awful carnage: all the above-named chieftains remained  dead on the field of battle, or were overtaken and put to death in their flight ;  though there are not wanting historians who assert that they contrived to escape",122,book_6,
"    cnap. u1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 85    from the slaughter, and were some time afterwards pardoned by ’Abdu-r-    rahman.   Al-huseyn '® Ibn Yahya Ibn Sa’id Ibn Sa’d Ibn ’Obddah Al-khazreji rose likewise aie rhuseyn  at Saragossa in the year 157 (beginning Nov. 20, a.p. 773), assisted by Suleyman governor of  Ibn Yokdhdén Al-’arabi Al-kelbi, the principal chief of that insurrection.’® They Saragosss  maintained themselves for some time against the arms of ’Abdu-r-rahman, until at  last Al-huseyn treacherously killed Suleyman, and Al-huseyn himself fell into the  hands of ’Abdu-r-rahmén, who had him executed, as we have related.”   In the year 163 (beginning Sept. 16, a.p. 779), Hasan Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz Al- Of Hesan Ibn  kendni” rose at Algesiras; but on the arrival of the troops sent against him by  ’Abdu-r-rahmén, he embarked on board a vessel, and sailed for the East.   But in order to check in future the rebellious spirit of the Arabian tribes, whom ara aon  he found animated with a strong hatred towards him,” ’Abdu-r-rahmén began to Berbers into  cease all communication with their chiefs, and to surround his person with slaves "" ope  and people entirely devoted to him; for which end he engaged followers and took  clients from every province of his empire, as well as from Africa. He sent people  over to enlist Berbers in his service ; and those who came to him he treated so well  as to make their comrades desirous of following them. In this manner, says the  historian Ibnu Hayyan, ’Abdu-r-rahmén collected an army of slaves and Berbers,  amounting to upwards of forty thousand men, by means of whom he always remained  victorious in every contest with the Arabian tribes of Andalus; his empire was  strengthened, and raised on solid foundations.   Whilst the Moslems of Andalus were thus revolting against their sovereign, and Success of the  striving to overthrow his empire, the people of Galicia were gathering strength,  and their power was greatly increased. Fruela, son of Alfonso, who was their king  at the time, attacked the fortresses and towns on the Moslem frontiers ; and after  expelling their inhabitants, took possession of them, and peopled them with his  own subjects. In this manner he took the cities of Lugo, Portokél (Oporto),  Zamora, Kashtelah, and Shekibi’ah (Segovia), which remained in the hands of his  posterity until Al-manstir Ibn Abi ’A’mir retook them some time before the over-  throw of the dynasty of Umeyyah; although soon after, alas! they fell a-second  time into the hands of the unbelievers, who, as we shall hereafter relate, reconquered  the whole of Andalus. May God Almighty be praised! His is the empire!   Kéroloh (Charlemagne), King of the Franks, and one of the most powerful eee,  sovereigns of that nation, after warring for a length of time with Abdu-r-rahman,  sent him an embassy, and solicited an alliance with him by marriage; but the  latter having met with an accident in the loins, which injured his virility, the",123,book_6,
"    Building of the  Rissafah.    Of the great  mosque.    86 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    design was abandoned. Kéroloh, however, sought his friendship and alliance, and  again insisted on the marriage ; 7° but this was declined, although a peace was con-  cluded between the two sovereigns.   Whilst the above events were taking place, ’Abdu-r-rahman,—whose passion for  building equalled, if it did not surpass, that of his predecessors of the house of  Umeyyah,—was daily adding to the embellishments of his capital by works which  he superintended himself. One of his first acts was to supply Cordova with water,  by means of an aqueduct which came from the neighbouring mountains. He  planted a most delightful garden, to which he gave the name of Mun'yat Ar-rissdfah,  in remembrance of a splendid villa near Damascus, which his grandfather Hisham  had built, and where he himself had spent the first years of his life. Finding the  spot a very charming one, he erected in the middle of it a most magnificent  palace, which he ornamented with every luxury which could be procured; and  moreover made it his residence in preference to the old palace inhabited by the  governors of Andalus. Being passionately fond of flowers, he commissioned an  intelligent botanist to procure for him in the East such among the fruits and  plants of that country as could be naturalized in Andalus ; and in this manner  he introduced the peach and the pomegranate called Safart.* Ibnu Hayydn has  preserved us four verses, which he is reported to have spoken extempore at the  sight of,one solitary palm-tree which grew in the middle of his garden.   “In the centre of the Rissdfah grows a palm-tree, born in the West, away  “« from the country of the palm-trees.   ‘“‘ T once exclaimed, ‘ Thou art like me; for thou resemblest me in wan-  ‘« dering and peregrination, and the long separation from relatives and friends.   ‘“« Thou [also] didst grow in a foreign soil, and, like me, art far away [from  “ the country of thy birth].   “‘ May the fertilizing clouds of morning water thee in thy exile! May  “* the beneficent rains, which the poor implore, never forsake thee !’”’ *   But whilst ’Abdu-r-rahman expended a portion of his treasures in this. and other  delightful dwellings, he was meditating a work far more meritorious in the eyes of  the Almighty, and which would insure him a place in Paradise; we mean the  erection of a magnificent place of worship, that which existed being in a ruinous  state, and being, besides, insufficient to hold the great concourse of people who  flocked to prayers. We quote the words of Ibnu Hayyén.   “In the year 170 (beginning July 2, a. pv. 786), ’Abdu-r-rahman began the  “¢ building of the great mosque, which was constructed on the site of the old one.  “‘ Though he did not live to see that magnificent edifice completed, he is said to",124,book_6,

He surrounded  “‘ Cordova with a thick and strong wall, the work beginning in the year 150, and  “ continuing for the greater part of his reign. He also supplied his capital with  “‘ water, built himself a palace, and erected mosques, baths, bridges, and castles  “in every province of his dominions.”  *Abdu-r-rahman, says Ibnu Hayyan, was kind-hearted, and well disposed to Character of  sae : . Abdur.   mercy. He was eloquent in his speech, and was endowed with a quick perception ; rahmén.  he was very slow in his determinations, but constant and persevering in carrying  them into effect ; he was exempt from all weakness, and prompt in his movements ;  he was active and stirring; he would never lie in repose or abandon himself  to indulgence; he never intrusted the affairs of the government to any one,  but administered them himself, yet he never failed to consult, on such difficult  cases as occurred, with people of wisdom and experience; he was a brave and  intrepid warrior, always the first in the field; he was terrible in his anger, and  could bear no opposition to his will; he could speak with much fluency and  elegance ; he was likewise a good poet, and composed verses extempore; he was,  in short, a beneficent, generous, and munificent prince. He always dressed in  white, and wore a turban of the same colour, which he preferred to any other ;  his countenance inspired with awe all those who approached him, whether friends  or foes. He used to attend funerals, and recite prayers over thé dead; he often  prayed with the people when he attended the mosque on Fridays and other  festivals, on which occasions he was in the habit of ascending the pulpit, and  addressing his subjects therefrom. He visited the sick, and mixed with the people,  attending their rejoicings and recreations. One day, as he was returning from a  funeral, he was met in the street by an impudent man of the lower orders, who,  fancying he had been wronged by a sentence lately passed against him, addressed  him thus: ‘“ May God prosper the Amir! Thy Kédi has wronged me, and I  “come to appeal to thee for justice.”—‘‘ If what thou statest be right, O man!”  said ’Abdu-r-rahman, ‘“ thy wrong shall be redressed.” But the man, extending  his hand, seized the bridle of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn’s horse, and said, ‘“ O Amir! I  ‘* entreat thee for God’s sake to grant my request. Move not from this spot  “until thou order thy Kédi to do justice unto me: there he is in thy suite.”  Hearing this, ’Abdu-r-rahm4n’s indignation was roused: he looked round for his  followers ; but saw that there were only a few, and those at some distance behind  him: he then called the K4di, and told him to do the man justice. On his return  to his palace, one of ’Abdu-r-rahmén’s favourites, who disapproved of his frequent  ramblings without a sufficient escort, represented to him the great danger to which  he had voluntarily exposed himself, and said to him, ‘‘ May God preserve thy life,",125,book_6,
"    His liberality.    88 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    “O Amir! These continual ramblings do not become a powerful Sultan like thee ;  “* for if once the eyes of the vulgar become accustomed to the sight of thee, all  ‘* salutary dread and respect will vanish away.” These words had the desired effect  on ’Abdu-r-rahmén ; for not only did he abstain ever afterwards from accompanying  the funerals, and mixing with the crowds, but he advised his son and successor  Hisham to do the same. :   The same historian (Ibnu Hayy4n) relates, that when, by the submission of Yusuf  Al-fehri, ’Abdu-r-rahm4n was freed from all his enemies, and firmly seated on his  throne, men hastened to Cordova from every province of Andalus to take the oath  of allegiance to him. For several days the palace of ’Abdu-r-rahm4n was crowded  with governors and chiefs, who came to swear fealty to him; and ’Abdu-r-  rahmaén would receive them with great affability on appointed days, and after  confirming them in their respective offices and land tenures, he would converse  with them, and address them in words which delighted them, and attached them  to him. He would also distribute among them dresses, food, and sundry presents.  In this way they all returned to their homes, highly pleased and satisfied, repeating  to each other the kind words they had listened to, expatiating in praises of their  sovereign, and invoking the favours of God for him. There happened to come  before ’Abdu-r-rahman on one of these occasions a man who belonged to the  division of Kenesrin,® who, after humiliating himself in his presence, addressed  him thus: ‘‘ O descendant of the righteous Khalifs and honourable Lords! to  “thee I fly, and under thy shelter I take refuge from calamitous times and the  ‘* injustice of fate. Money is scanty, and my family is numerous; my situation  “* becomes every day more precarious, and riches are given to thee that thou mayest  “ distribute them more amply. Thou art the Lord of praise and glory, the imparter  “ of gifts, and the hope of the destitute.”—’Abdu-r-rahmdn immediately answered,  ‘* We have listened to thy words, and remedied thy wants ; we have issued orders  “that thou shouldst be helped against fortune, and regret the miserable plight  “to which thou hast been reduced. Let all those who are in the same condition  “‘ with thyself apply to us for help, and make known to us their poverty or mis-  “ fortunes, either personally, or by means of memorials placed in our hands, in  “ order that we may alleviate the blows of fate, and, by remedying their poverty,  “ avert the malignant rejoicings of their enemies.” He then ordered a large sum  of money to be given to the Arab, who left the room highly rejoiced, and in  utter amazement at the Amir’s eloquence, readiness of wit, and unbounded  liberality. ’Abdu-r-rahmén, moreover, issued orders that all those who came to  him with petitions should be admitted to his audience-room without delay, that  he might attend to their cases, and listen to their complaints. In this manner,",126,book_6,
"    CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 89    says the author above cited [Ibnu Hayy4n], numbers of poor distressed people, who  had either met with some misfortune or were the victims of iniquitous judgment  passed upon them, would flock to the Amir’s hall on the days of public audience,  when they invariably obtained the redress of their wrongs. It was ’Abdu-r-  rahman’s custom to dine in company with such among his courtiers and public  officers as happened to be with him at the hours of his meals, and whoever came to  him upon business at those hours was by him invited to sit down and partake  with him.   Of ’Abdu-r-rahman’s wit and eloquence several traits have been preserved by Ee wit and  the historians. Ibnu Hayy4n relates, that having once received a letter from  Suleymdn Ibn Yoktdn Al-’ar4bi, in which that chieftain tried to deceive him, he  made the following reply: ‘‘ Let me alone with thy frivolous excuses, whilst thou  “art quitting the path of duty; extend thy hands towards obedience, and hold  “* by the strings of the multitude ; do not persevere in thy disobedience and rebellion,  “and let the fate of thy predecessors be a warning to thee, for God is never unjust  ‘to his servants.”   After the taking of Saragossa, and the execution of the rebel Huseyn Al-anséri,  whose head, together with those of the principal inhabitants of the city, was fixed  on stakes, ’Abdu-r-rahman’s courtiers hastened to congratulate him on a victory so  signal, and which had realized his most ardent hopes. Among those who approached  him was a man who had not been present at the siege, and who yet complimented  him like the rest in a tone of voice both loud and rude. Turning sharply towards  him, ’Abdu-r-rahman said, ‘“‘ By Allah! were it not that this is a day in which He  ‘‘ who is over me has granted me a most special favour, and in which it is therefore  “incumbent upon me also to bestow my favours upon those who are under me,  “‘ T would have thee most severely punished for presuming to address me in that  “ disrespectful manner, as if thou wert accosting thy father, thy brother, or thy  “‘ wife, and entirely disregarding the respect due to royalty.”   ’Abdu-r-rahman has been accused of ingratitude to those to whom he was most  indebted ; and certainly his treatment of his freedman Bedr, who was the principal  instrument of his success, who shared his privations and misfortunes, accompanied  him in his flight as well as in concealment, and sought out an empire for him in  the East or West, by sea or land, cannot be excused. No sooner had he risen His ingratitude  to power than he deprived him of all his honours, cast him into prison, and, at last, we  exiled him to the confines of his empire, where he died in great poverty and  affliction. The author of the Mas‘hab [Al-hijari] relates that Bedr once wrote to  his master from his place of exile as follows: ‘I should have thought that, after  “* crossing the sea, and traversing the deserts, in order to procure thee a kingdom,   VOL, II.

I verily think that had I fallen into the hands of the Beni ’Abbas,  ‘“*T could not have been worse treated by them than I have been by thee. But  ‘* God is over all things, and to Him we must all return.” What reason ’Abdu-r-  rahmdén may have had thus to act towards his faithful servant Bedr is only known  to God, who looks into the interior of men’s hearts, and unravels their secrets:  perhaps ’Abdu-r-rahman had reasons for thus acting towards his faithful servant ;  or perhaps the latter was calumniated, as often happens, by people who knew his  low origin, and saw with envy his rapid rise in honours and fortune.”   Nor was ’Abdu-r-rahman more grateful to “Abi Othman, the Arabian chieftain  who was the first to raise the standard in his favour ; for when ’Abdu-r-rahman saw  his power firmly established, he would no longer attend to him, nor to those who,  like him, had most contributed to his success. At last, Abi ’Othmén, seeing  himself ill-treated, and his applications disregarded, caused a nephew of his, on  the female side, to revolt in one of the castles in the district of Elvira. ’Abdu-r-  rahméan dispatched some troops against him, and the rebel was taken and beheaded.  After this, Abi ’Othmd4n seduced one of ’Abdu-r-rahman’s own nephews, to whom  he painted in bright colours how easy it would be to revolt against his uncle and  deprive him both of his life and throne; but ’Abdu-r-rahmén, having received  intelligence of the conspiracy in time, seized on the persons of his nephew and  the principal conspirators, and had them all beheaded, with the exception of Abi  ’Othman ; for, although he was repeatedly told that he was one of their number,  and that it was he who had instigated his nephew to revolt and had assured  him of success, he would always answer, ‘“‘ Let Abi ’Othmén alone; for he is  “the Abi Salmah* of this dynasty, and I would on no account give the people  “* cause to say that I treated him as the Beni ’Abbds treated Abu Salmah ; I intend,  “« however, to inflict on him a chastisement worse than death itself.”” He then sent  for him, and, after charging him with his treacherous conduct, deprived him of.  all his honours and emoluments, though some time afterwards he re-instated him  in his office, and took him again into favour.   The next person who was most instrumental in ’Abdu-r-rahmdn’s elevation to  power was Abi ’Othman’s son-in-law, Abdullah Ibn Khaled, who shared with him  the duties of the Wizirate. It appears that when Abii-s-sabéh, the chief of the  Yemeni Arabs, revolted, he gave out as a reason that certain terms agreed to  between himself and ’Abdullah, in his master’s name, had been violated by ’Abdu-r-",128,book_6,

After the capture and execution of that chieftain, ’Abdu-r-rahmén  removed Ibn Khaled from his office, and swore never to employ him as long as  he lived. ’Abdullah, accordingly, passed out of memory at the court, and remained  without taking any part whatever in the affairs of the government. Another man  who most strenuously contributed to ’Abdu-r-rahman’s accession, and at first shared  his intimacy, was Temdm Ibn ’Alkamah, who, as already mentioned, crossed the sea  to him, and was the first to announce to him the good tidings of the rising in his  favour. ’Abdu-r-rahman, however, soon forgot his past services, and his son and  successor, Hisham, put to death a son of Temdm,” as well as a son of Abi Othman.  Alluding to this event, Ibnu Hayyan says, “The execution of the two youths, ey  “ ordered as it was by the son of the man to whom their lives ought to have been  “most precious, well convinced their disconsolate fathers of the truth, that no one  ‘“‘ has a right to expect praiseworthy deeds from his own kindred.” Indeed, if we  “* compare the fate of those who were the principal instruments of ’Abdu-r-rahman’s  “ success, and who gave him the empire, with that of those who resisted his  “ authority and were subdued, we shall find that the fate of the former was the  “‘ more lamentable and severe of the two.”   The first who filled the office of Hajib to ’Abdu-r-rahman was his mauli Temam Hfibs of  Ibn ’Alkamah: he lived to a great age. He was succeeded in that office by mshmén.  Yusuf Ibn Bokht Al-faresi, a freedman of ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Merwdn, who left  a numerous posterity in Cordova. The next was ’Abdu-l-kerim Ibn Mahrdan, of  the posterity of Al-hérith Ibn Abi Shamr Al-ghosdni, who was succeeded by  *Abdu-r-rahmdn Ibn Mugheyth Ibn Al-harith Ibn Huwirath Ibn Jabalah Ibni-l-  ayham, whose father had been the conqueror of Cordova, as before related; after  this, Manstir the eunuch, the first of his class who obtained that office under the  Beni Umeyyah : he retained his office until the death of ’Abdu-r-rahmén.   Ad-dakhel had not Wizirs, properly speaking, who administered the government Councillors.  in his name; but he had a certain number of Sheikhs who sat in council and  assisted him with their experience and advice. The first in rank among these  was the aforesaid Abi ’Othman; then came his son-in-law ’Abdullah Ibn Khaled ;  then Abi ’Abdah, governor of Seville ; then Shoheyd, son of ’Isa, son of Shoheyd.   This last-named individual was the descendant of a Berber, others say a Greek, who  was made a prisoner in the first wars of Islam, and became a slave of Mu’dwiyah  Ibn Merwdn Ibn Al-hakem: from him are descended the Beni Shoheyd, an  illustrious family of Cordova. The next were, ’Abdu-s-sell4m Ibn Basil, also a  Greek, and a freedman of ’Abdullah Ibn Mu’dwiyah, whose posterity obtained  great renown in the Wizirate and in other offices; Tha’lebah Ibn ’Obeyd  Ibn An-nadhdhém Al-jodh4mi, governor of Saragossa; and ’A’ssem Ibn Moslem",129,book_6,

It was he who at the battle of Cordova (Musdrah) set the  example to the troops, by swimming across the river. His posterity afterwards  attained great renown as public functionaries under various reigns.   The first Katibs or secretaries appointed by ’Abdu-r-rahman when he assumed the  supreme power, and took possession of Cordova, were Abi Othman and ’Abdullah  Ibn Khaled. He then named to that office Umeyyah Ibn Yezid, a mauli of  Mu’awiyah Ibn Merwan, who, as before stated, had also been secretary to Yusuf  Al-fehri. This Umeyyah had likewise a seat in the council-room, where he was  much esteemed for his experience and his talents. It is said that he was implicated  in the conspiracy of Al-yezidi against ’Abdu-r-rahmdan, but that he died before that  monarch was apprised of it, when Al-yezidi was in consequence put to death.   Ibn Zeydiin relates, that when ’Abdu-r-rahman took possession of Cordova he  confirmed Yahya Ibn Yezid Al-yahssobi in the charge of Kddi-l-jamd’h (supreme  judge), which he was then filling. After him he appointed Abi ’Amru Mu’Awiyah  Ibn Saleh Al-hemsi ;* after him ’Omar Ibn Sharéhil ; 3? then ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn  Tarif. Jodran Ibn ’Amru was judge* to the army.   ’Abdu-r-rahman died in the year 172 (beginning June 10, a. p. 788), after a reign  of thirty-three years and four months, counted from the day of his landing on the  coast of Almufecar to that of his death. Others say that he died in 171, during  the Khalifate of Harin Ar-rashid. He was buried within the palace of Cordova,  his son ’Abdullah reciting the funeral service over his body. He was born in  the year 113 (beginning March 14, a.p. 731), at Deyr-hinnd, in the territory of  Damascus, or, according to other authorities, at Al-’aliy4, a town of the jurisdic-  tion of Tadmor. His mother was a native of Barbary; her name was Raha. His  father, Mu’dwiyah, died in the year 118 (beginning January 19, a.p. 736), at the  age of twenty-one, and during the lifetime of his own father, the Commander  of the Faithful. Hish4m intended him as his successor in the Khalifate, and  had him educated accordingly. Mu’Awiyah having upon his death-bed intrusted  the guardianship of his sons to their grandfather Hishém, the Khalif took care  of them, and especially of this ’Abdu-r-rahman, to whom he allotted, for his  maintenance, his own share in the revenue of Andalus, the prince sending thither  a man named Sa’id Ibn Abi Leyla* to collect it in his name.   The dates given by Ibnu Hayyédn differ slightly from the above. We here  transcribe his words: ‘ ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ad-ddkhel was born in the year 113,  ‘or, according to other writers, in the year before, at ’Aliyd, in the district of  “‘Tadmor; others say at Deyr-hinnd, in the territory of Damascus, where his  “‘ father Mu’dwiyah died in the lifetime of the Commander of the Faithful, Hisham",130,book_6,

It was this Mu’dwiyah who interceded for Al-kamet, the poet, when  ‘“‘ Hisham had unjustly decreed his death. .   “ Ad-dakhel died on the 24th day of Rabi’-l-akhar of the year 171 (Sept. 30,  “a. p. 787), being then fifty-seven years old: some writers make him sixty-two  “* years of age at the time of his death. He was buried within the royal palace  “* of Cordova, his eldest son ’Abdullah reading the funeral service over his body.  “He was fortunate and successful in all that he undertook, and conquered all  ‘* his enemies, as we have sufficiently demonstrated in our account of his battles.  ‘“* As a further proof of his good fortune, we might add what an historian relates  “ of him ; namely, that the banner which he assumed on his first landing in Andalus  “was never defeated, and that it was not until that banner was lost that the  “empire of the Beni Umeyyah gave signs of decay.” Such is the narrative of  the trustworthy historian Ibnu Hayydn, from whose works we have already tran-  scribed enough to render any information on this last topic superfluous.   One of the historians of the West, after copying the above passage from Ibnu  Hayyan, draws the following picture of ’Abdu-r-rahmén: ‘‘ The Im4m ’Abdu-r-  ‘‘rahmén Ad-ddkhel was a man of very sound judgment and quick perception ;  “he was deeply learned, and could express himself with facility and elegance ;  “he was slow and prudent in his determinations, but firm in carrying them into  ‘effect. Not once did he unfurl his banners against his enemies that he did  “ not return victorious from the field of battle. He was exceedingly liberal, and  “‘ well versed in the science of government: he always dressed in white, and  ‘wore a turban of the same colour.» He used to visit the sick and attend  “ funerals, saying his prayers at the mosque in common with the people on  “‘ Fridays and other festivals; he harangued his troops himself, and raised the  “banners with his own hand; he appointed Hajibs and Katibs: his army  “amounted to 100,000 men.”   *Abdu-r-rahman was surnamed Ad-dakhel, (i. e. the enterer,®*) because he was  the first of his family who entered Andalus, and Sakr Koraysh (the hawk of  Koraysh), owing to the rapidity with which he subjected that country to his  rule. As elsewhere related, he abolished the rule of the Beni ’Abbds in Andalus,  and founded in that country a powerful empire for his posterity, restoring to his  race in the West that supremacy which they had lost in the East, and preparing  for them the way to the Khalifate. Although, at the beginning of his reign,  he was troubled by frequent rebellions in the provinces, and by the invasions  of the generals sent by As-seffah,?’ he, nevertheless, vanquished and subdued  all those who opposed him, and ultimately abolished the spiritual rule of the",131,book_6,

Yet, neither ’Abdu-r-rahm4n nor his immediate  successors assumed any other title than that of Amfru-l-moslemin (Commander  of the Moslems of Andalus), out of respect for the seat of the Khalifate, which  was still the abode of Islam, and the meeting-place of the Arabian tribes. How-  ever, after the year 300 of the Hijra, his namesake, ’Abdu-r-rahm4n An-nasir,  the eighth Sultén of his family, seeing the state of affairs in the East,—where  the Beni ’Abbdés had been overpowered by foreigners, who left only a shadow of  power in their hands,—and yielding to the entreaties of his subjects and the  advice of his most eminent theologians, took the titles of Améru-l-mimenin  (Commander of the Faithful), Im&m** and Khalif, which his successors also  assumed, as we shall relate hereafter.   Ibn Zeydtin says that ’Abdu-r-rahmén had a clear complexion and reddish  hair; he had high cheek-bones, with a mole on his face: he was tall and slender  in body, wore his hair parted in two ringlets, could only see out of one eye, and was  destitute of the sense of smelling. He left twenty children, eleven of whom were  sons, the remainder daughters.",132,book_6,

On the death of ’Abdu-r-rahmén, his son Hisham, surnamed Abi-l-walid, who no of  had been previously appointed his successor, ascended the throne. His mother’s   name was Halal.! He was born on the 4th of Shawwal, a.u. 139 (Feb. 28,   4.D. 757), that is, one year after his father’s arrival in Andalus. When the   empire devolved on him he was absent at Merida, of which city he was governor,   as his father, with a view to train him in the duties of administration, had, from   his earliest youth, given him several offices to discharge: he was, accordingly,  proclaimed at Merida in 172 (a. p. 788).   Hishém was not ’Abdu-r-rahmén’s eldest son; but that monarch, who always  showed a great predilection for him, and knew his excellent qualities, preferred him  to his other sons, and named him his successor. They say that whenever ’Abdu-r-  rahman inquired how his two sons, Suleyman and Hishdm, spent their time, the  answer he received was invariably this: ‘If thy son Hishdm receives company,  “his hall is thronged with learned men, poets, or historians, who discuss the  “* exploits of the brave, and converse about military affairs, and so forth; whereas  “ the hall of thy son Suleyman is always filled with sycophants, fools, and cowards.”  By means of this and other similar reports, Hish4m rose high in his father’s esteem,  in proportion as his brother Suleyman descended, until that monarch decided upon  naming him his successor to the empire, to the prejudice of his elder brother.   One day, as ’Abdu-r-rahmén was sitting in his hall, surrounded by his courtiers,  he repeated the following verses, and asked Hishdm whether he knew where they  were to be found :   “If thou consider his brilliant qualities, thou wilt easily find out who his  “* father was, and who his ancestors,—who is Yezid and who is Hajr..",133,book_6,
"    His interview  with an astro-  loger.    96 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    ‘* Observe his generosity, his piety, his good faith, his logical acuteness,  ‘« whether he is sober or intoxicated [after a banquet].” ?   No sooner had he uttered them, than Hishdm exclaimed, ‘‘ O my Lord! those  “ verses are the composition of ’Amré-l-kays, King of Kindah, and it seems as  ‘if they had been written on thy account.” So pleased was his father with  this answer, that he ordered many bounteous gifts to Hisham, who from that  moment rose high in his estimation. They relate that as Suleym4n, who was  also present at this interview, went out of the audience-room, he asked some one  whose verses they were, and repeated them until he knew them by heart; he  then said, ‘‘ To gain my father’s affection I have nothing more to do than learn  by heart some of the sayings of the Arabs;” and that when these words were  reported to ’Abdu-r-rahm4n he was struck with astonishment, and became more  convinced than ever of the great disparity between his two sons.   Soon after his accession to power, Hishdm sent for a celebrated astrologer who  resided at Algesiras, and whose name was Adh-dhobi. He was a man of great  reputation for his knowledge of astrology, and of the influence of the stars upon  mundane affairs, which he had studied in the writings of Ptolemy. In com-  pliance with Hishdm’s orders the astrologer repaired to Cordova, where, imme-  diately on his arrival, that monarch closeted himself up with him and addressed  him thus: “I doubt not thou hast already divined the reason of thy being  “sent for; I need not, therefore, give thee any further explanation. Tell me  “now, with God’s permission, what thy science discloses to thee respecting my  “ future destiny.” The astrologer hesitated to give answer, and said, ‘‘ Pardon  “me, O Amir! I am but a novice in that science; and it is beyond my power  “* to execute thy commands, as I am not at all deserving of the honour of observing  “* a subject so superior to myself in rank and dignity.”—‘‘ Heed not that,” replied  Hish4m, ‘I raise thee to my own station, and thou wilt thereby become competent  to the task.”   Some days after this interview, the astrologer was again summoned to the  presence of Hisham, who said to him, ‘‘ What I asked thee the other day has kept  ‘me since in a state of great agitation, although God knows I place no confidence  ‘in things which are amongst His impenetrable secrets, and the knowledge of  ‘‘ which he has reserved to Himself. Yet I ardently desire to hear what thou hast  ‘“‘ to predict to me: man is naturally fond of inquiry, and he is bound by the hope  ** of reward, as well as by the fear of punishment.” Adh-dhobi then said, ‘‘ Thy  “ reign, O Amir! will be glorious and fortunate: it will be marked by victories  “‘ over thy enemies: its duration, however, if my calculations be right, will only  ‘“* be eight years or thereabout.” After a moment’s reflection, Hishdm lifted up",134,book_6,
"    CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 97    his head, and said, ‘“‘ O Adh-dhobf! I am not in the least alarmed at thy pre-  “diction, though it may be the unerring admonisher who informs me by thy  “tongue; for if the time of life allotted to me be spent in adoration of the  ‘* Almighty, when the hour comes I will say with resignation, ‘May His will be  ‘done!’” Hishém then dismissed the astrologer, after rewarding him munificently,  and from that day abstained from the pleasures of this world, and made justice and  benevolence the sole guide of his actions.   Among the anecdotes related of Hisham, and which show his love of justice nis justice.  and his liberality, the following is one: As he was once, in his father’s lifetime,  journeying out of Cordova, he halted on an eminence close to the banks of the river  (Guadalquivir), whence he saw a man from Jaen, whom he well knew—having on  a previous occasion rendered him some service—running in great haste and trepi-  dation towards the spot where his tent was pitched. Hishém immediately guessed  the cause of the man’s fear and hasty flight: he had perhaps experienced some  ill-treatment from his brother Suleymén, then governor of Jaen; he had escaped  his vengeance, and was now hastening to implore his help. He therefore gave  orders to his attendants, that on the arrival of the man he should be immediately  introduced to his presence. This being done as he desired, and the fugitive being  conducted to his tent, he addressed him thus: ‘‘ O Kenéni! I know not what has  “ brought thee here ; but I should say that thou art fleeing from some calamity.” —  “Thou sayest right, O my Lord!” replied the man; ‘I am trying to avert  “* misfortune from my head. Listen to my tale: A member of my tribe [Kendnah]  ‘‘ has put to death a man belonging to another tribe: according to custom I have  “‘ handed over to the tribe of the deceased the usual expiation-money, that they  “may distribute it among his family and relatives; yet thy brother Suleyman,  ‘“‘ knowing how much I am favoured and distinguished by thee, is not satisfied,  ‘‘ and wishes to proceed further in this affair.” Hearing this, Hishdm lifted up a  curtain leading to the interior of his tent, and stretching his hand towards one  of his slave girls, who happened to be sitting behind, cut off a beautiful pearl  necklace which she wore, and presented it to him, saying, ‘‘ Take this, O Kendnf! Liberality.  “and sell it; it is worth three thousand dindrs: do not part with it for less; keep  “‘ the money to redeem thyself and thy people, and no one shall injure thee.”—  “O my Lord,” replied the man, ‘“‘ I came not hither to ask for thy gifts, nor do  ‘* T want money ; the expiation price being already paid down. I came to complain  “* of the crying injustice done unto me, and to implore thy powerful assistance ; for  “if thou protect me in this matter, and thy intercession for me is made public,  “‘T shall grow in importance among those who hate me, merely because thou   . “ befriendest me.”—‘‘ How is that to be accomplished?” said Hisham. ‘‘ Thou  VOL.

He happened to arrive at a time when ’Abdu-r-rahmén had retired into the interior  apartments, and did not wish to be disturbed by applications. He said, notwith-  standing, on hearing of his son’s arrival, ‘‘ Nothing can bring my son Abi-l-walid  “« (Hishém] hither at this time of the day save business of the most pressing nature ;  “let him come in.” Hish4m entered the apartment, and, after giving his father the  saldm, stood in a respectful attitude before him. ’*Abdu-r-rahm4n motioned him  to sit down, and state his business. ‘‘ May God prosper the Amir, my lord and  “ father!” exclaimed Hish4ém. ‘ How can I sit down when those [who claim my  “ interference] stand injured and oppressed? It behoves those of my rank and  ‘station not to sit down unless they be content and satisfied, and I cannot be  “so unless the Amir puts me at my ease by granting my request. Otherwise  “« T shall go back to my people.”—’Abdu-r-rahman then said to him, ‘‘ God forbid  “ that thou shouldst leave my presence discontented and disappointed. Sit down,  “ were it only that we may accede to the prayers of one who intercedes: speak out,  “and tell us thy business.” Hishdm then sat down, as commanded, and related  to his father the whole of the case: upon which ’Abdu-r-rahmdn gave orders that  the expiatory sum paid to the tribe of the deceased should be taken out of his  treasury, and that Suleym4n should be instructed not to proceed further in the  matter, and to suspend all proceedings against the Ken4ni. Upon which Hisham  left the palace, highly pleased and gratified, and expatiating in praise of his father’s  generosity and justice. When the Kendni came to take leave of Hishdm, to ‘return  to Jaen, he said to him, ‘‘ This certainly exceeds my expectations, and thy favours  ‘* come down upon me more profusely even than I could have wished. Here is  “the necklace thou gavest me; I do not want it, let it be restored to its owner.  “I shall not be the less grateful for the singular service I have received at thy  “hands.” Hishdm, however, refused to take it back, saying, ‘‘ We never take  ‘* back what we have once given.”   Like the Khalif Omar Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz, Hishdm followed the maxim of sending  men of probity and virtue, and on whom he could rely, to the various pro-  vinces of his empire, to inquire into the condition of his subjects, and ascertain  the opinions of the inhabitants respecting the conduct of their governors and magis-  trates ; and if in this manner any one of his public officers was convicted of having  committed injustice, he would deprive him of his situation, oblige him to make due  amends, and for ever afterwards exclude him from his service. So eminent were",136,book_6,

His eldest brother Suleyman especially, to  whom he had been preferred by his father, shook off his allegiance, and appeared  in arms against him, assisted by another brother, called ’Abdullah. After many  sanguinary encounters between the royal troops and those commanded by his two  brothers, Hisham repaired in person to the seat of war; and the wheel of fortune  turning in his favour, he defeated the rebels, and compelled them to have recourse  to his clemency. Thus rid of his internal enemies, Hisham turned his arms against  the infidels.   In the days of Hish4m, the celebrated city of Narbonne* was again wrested from Taking of  the Christians. His Galician vassals having sued for peace, Hish4m only granted Narbonne.  it to them on very hard conditions; one of which was their having to carry a  certain number of loads of earth® out of the demolished walls of the conquered  city, Narbonne, to the gate of his own palace in Cordova, to be used there in the  construction of a mosque, opposite to the Babu-l-jendn (gate of the gardens) ; and  not only was the mosque built of those materials, but a large quantity still remained  piled up in front of the royal palace.   In the spring of the year 175 (beginning May 9, a. p. 791), having put himself i araleith the  at the head of a powerful army, he reached the districts of Alava and the Castles,® ,  met the unbelievers, and defeated them completely. In the same year (175) God  again sent down victory to his arms; for, having dispatched one ‘of his generals,  named Yisuf Ibn Bokht’ Al-faresi, against the Galicians, that chief penetrated Expedition to  into their country at the head of considerable forces, and met their king, Bere-  mundoh (Bermudo), whom he defeated, making great slaughter among his followers,  and reducing a considerable portion of his states.   In the ensuing year, a.H. 176 (beginning April 27, a.p. 792), Hishdm sent To Alava.  forward his Wizir ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn ’Abdi-l-wdhed Ibn Mugheyth on a similar  service ; and this general reached the districts of Alava and the Castles, wherein he  committed all manner of depredations.   After this, in the year 177 (beginning April 17, a.p. 793), Hisham sent the  same general in another direction. This time ’Abdu-l-malek marched to Ariinah  (Narbonne) and Jerundah (Gerona), laid waste the territories adjoining those two",137,book_6,

Another invasion was made by the command of Hishém in the year 178 (be-  ginning April 6, a.p. 794), ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn ’Abdi-l-wahed penetrated far into  Galicia, and reached Ashtorkah (Astorga), where the King of the Galicians, assisted  by the King of the Basques, seemed disposed to make a stand; but not daring to  come to close quarters with the Moslems, the two kings retreated into their states,  whither they were hotly pursued by ’Abdu-l-malek. Hisham, moreover, had  previously sent by another route some forces,? which joined ’Abdu-l-malek in the  enemy’s country, and laid it waste. They were opposed by the troops of the  Franks, who at first obtained some trifling advantage over them, though the  Moslems at last returned safe and victorious.   Among the praiseworthy actions of this Sultén, one is the restoration of the  famous bridge of Cordova,’® which, as before related, had been erected by As-samh  Al-khauldni, governor of Andalus, during the Khalifate of ""Omar Ibn ’Abdi-1-’aziz,  and was proverbial for its beauty and dimensions. Hisham designed it himself, and  inspected the work till its completion. Happening on a certain day to ask one of  his Wizirs what the people of Cordova said about it, the Wizir replied, ‘‘ They say  “ that the Amir’s only motive in rebuilding this bridge is, that he may pass over  ‘it when he goes out hunting.” Hearing which, Hish4m bound himself by a most  solemn oath never to pass it again; a vow which he is known to have kept most  scrupulously as long as he lived. .   During the reign of this Sultdén several eminent doctors left Cordova and other  cities in Andalus to make their pilgrimage to Mekka. Among their number were,  Fara’in Ibnu-l-’abbés, ""Isa Ibn Dinar, Sa’id Ibn Abi Hind, and others, who, on  their return to Andalus, failed not to diffuse the rays of theological science which  they had diligently gathered in the East. Some, moreover, who had there become  acquainted with Malik Ibn Ans, and had adopted his religious opinions, began to  describe him as a man eminent by his talents and virtues, and to speak of the  extent of his learning, and the great honour and estimation in which he was held  all over the East ; by which means the fame of that celebrated theologian spread  throughout Andalus, his doctrines were publicly taught, and his religious opinions  satisfactorily explained. This prepared the way for the rejection of the rite of Al-  auza’i, and the adoption of that of Malik Ibn Ans, which happened soon after, under  the reign of his successor [Al-hakem I., the son of Hisham]. They say that Abu  *Abdillah Zeyad Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Ibn Zeydd Al-lakhmi, better known by the by-  name of Shabattin, whom Andalusian writers designate more generally under the",138,book_6,

This Shabatttin was as virtuous and modest as he was learned.  They relate of him, that the Sultan Hisham wished once to appoint him to the charge  of Kadi of Cordova ; but this Zeydd obstinately refused, under the plea that he was  unworthy of that office. Hish4m wished to compel him to accept it, but he fled ;  when the people said to the Sultan, ‘“O Hishdm, if all men were like Shabattin,  there would be peace in this world.” Hisham then sent for him, and pardoned him ;  when, having previously received a safe conduct, he returned to his house. They  relate of him, that whilst he was thus contending with his sovereign, Hisham offering  him that high office, and Shabattin refusing to accept of it, some of the Wizirs  called upon him, and declared to him the Sultdn’s determination that he should accept  the appointment offered to him ; upon which he said to them, ‘ Do not importune  “me; for if you make me once take a dislike to the office, I shall behave in such  ‘“‘a manner that you shall soon wish to see me out of it again. For instance, were  “my wife such a one, thrice divorced [by some of you], to come to me, laying  “claim to any thing remaining in your hands, I would most certainly issue orders  ‘“‘ for its restoration, and make you besides answer for keeping it.” When the  Wizirs heard Shabatttin express himself in this way, they saw that he was in earnest,  and they went and reported the conversation to the Amir, who no longer insisted  upon Zeydd accepting the office of Kadi. But to return: This Zeydd, having  become acquainted with Malik Ibn Ans, read the Mowattd under his direction ;  he also learned under Mu’Awiyah Ibn Séleh, whose daughter afterwards received  lessons from him. Zeydd""™ died, according to some writers, in the year 204  (beginning June 27, a.p. 819); others advance his death eleven years [193] ;  others place it in 194; others in 199: the first date, however, is the most com-  monly received: but God only knows the truth of the case !   Suwwar Ibn Tarik Al-kortobi, a freedman of ’Abdu-r-rahmén I., was another of  the eminent men who left Cordova under this reign, to travel in the East. He  visited the city of Basrah, where he met with Al-asma’i and other distinguished  characters of the time. He then returned to Andalus, where he was appointed  preceptor to Al-hakem. He left several sons ; among whom the most distinguished  was Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Suwwar, who also made a pilgrimage to Mekka.   After a prosperous reign of seven years and nine months, some historians say Death of  eight [months], Hisham died in the year 180 (a. p. 796). He is counted among indi.  the good and virtuous monarchs, full of military ardour, and zeal for the promotion  of the faith, Among the commendable acts of his administration one was his  continuing and completing the construction of the great mosque of Cordova, which",139,book_6,

He had also  the merit of not exacting from his Moslem subjects more taxes than the seka’h or  tithe prescribed by the Kordn and the Sunna (traditionary law). May God have  mercy on him! His age, when he died, was forty years and four months, having been  born, as above stated, in the month of Shawwal of the year 139. His mild temper,  his generosity, and his’ love of justice, were such that his subjects gave him  the surnames of Ar-rodha, (the amiable), and Al-’ddil (the just). Among the  laudable practices introduced by him, the historian Saken'* Ibn Ibrahim records  the following: He instituted a night-watch, composed of honest citizens, who  went their rounds; and if any disturber of the public peace was apprehended, he  was fined according to his offence: the produce of the fines was then sent to such  poor people as were found in the mosques in dark and rainy nights.   On the death of Hishém, his son Al-hakem, whom he had previously designated  as his successor, ascended the throne.’* Soon after his accession, Al-hakem  increased the number of his mamelukes and guards, formed a body of cavalry,  which he kept in constant readiness for action, infused vigour into every branch of  the administration, and took into his own hands the direction of affairs. In con-  sequence, however, of the civil wars which broke out between him and his two  uncles,'® the infidels seized the opportunity to invade the territory of the Moslems.  Having made an incursion into the districts of Barcelona,'® they reduced that city in  the year 185 (a.p. 801), the Moslem garrison withdrawing to such other fortresses  as acknowledged their sway in those parts.   Al-hakem dispatched an army to Galicia, under the command of his Hajib,  *Abdu-l-kerim Ibn [’Abdi-l-wihed Ibn] Mugheyth, who penetrated far into that  country, and wasted it. As he was returning from this expedition, he found the  enemy posted on the heights, and occupying the passes by which he had to cross ;  but he defeated them with great slaughter, and succeeded in reaching the dominions  of Islam in safety.   Al-hakem had also internal enemies to contend with ; and, among other rebellions  which he had to put down, the most serious and formidable was that of the  inhabitants of one of the suburbs of Cordova. It originated thus: Al-hakem  having since the commencement of his reign shown great propensity to worldly  pleasures, some of the most eminent theologians of Cordova, and other men dis-  tinguished by their piety and learning, as Yahya Ibn Yahya Al-leythi, the disciple  of Malik Ibn Ans, and one of those who delivered traditions from the mouth of that  Im4m, Talit the theologian, and others, revolted against him, and proclaimed in  his stead one of his relatives.” The scene of this commotion was the western '®  suburb of Cordova. Al-hakem, who had a body of troops encamped close to his",140,book_6,
"    CHAP. 111.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 103    palace, marched against the rebels, whom he defeated and dispersed. He then Exemplary |  entered the suburb, which he razed to the ground, not sparing even the mosques, ° the rebels.  and expelled the inhabitants. Some of them fled to Africa, and settled at Fez,   where they peopled a quarter of the city called after them Med{natu-l-andalusitn   (the town of the Andalusians) ; others went to Alexandria. Those who fled to the   latter city, being in considerable number, created some disturbances there, and  subsequently revolted against the authorities of the place; upon which ’Abdullah   Ibn Téhir,!? who was governor of Egypt for the Khalif Al-mamin, son of Hérin  Ar-rashid, attacked and defeated them, and transported the remainder to the island   of Akritis (Crete), which they conquered, and held until, after a considerable length   of time, the Franks® dispossessed them of it. During their occupation of Crete   the Andalusians were governed by kings of the posterity of Abi Hafss* ’Omar   Ibn Sho’ayb, surnamed Ibnu-l-ghalith, a native of Betrih (Pedroches), who was   their leader at the time of their attack on the island. The last of them was  *Abdu-l-’aziz.   Yahya Ibn Yahya, one of the principal conspirators, fled to Toledo; but having  some time after obtained a safe conduct from Al-hakem, he returned to Cordova,  and was pardoned. The same happened with Tahit, who not only obtained  forgiveness, but rose afterwards to the favour of his sovereign.   Taldt was the son of ’Abdi-l-jabbaér Al-ma’éferi.” He had made a pilgrimage to  Mekka, and visited Misr (Cairo), where he met the Imém Malik Ibn Ans, and  profited by his lessons: he then returned to Cordova. After the taking of the  suburb where the rebels had fortified themselves, Talut at first took refuge at the  house of a Jew; but after some time he went to one of his friends, Abi Bess4m,  the Katib, who, he trusted, would intercede for him, and obtain his pardon  from Al-hakem. Far from this, Abi Bess4m denounced him, and Télit was  accordingly summoned to the presence of his sovereign. Being admitted to the  hall of audience, Al-hakem reproached him in the harshest terms, and charged him  with his crime; saying, ‘‘ How camest thou to rebel against me? thou, a disciple  ‘of the Imam Malik, from whom thou must have heard, that the long rule of  “a bad king is preferable to civil war for one hour? By Allah! thou must have  ‘heard thy master say so.”—‘‘I did,” answered Télit, humbly. ‘‘ Well, then,”  said Al-hakem, “‘ return to thy dwelling; thou art forgiven.” He then asked him  where he had been concealed ; and Talit informed him that he had remained for a  whole year at the house of a Jew, whom he named, and had afterwards gone to his  friend the Katib, Abi Bess4m, who, instead of sheltering and interceding for him,  as he had expected, had been treacherous, and denounced him. Hearing this,  Al-hakem grew very angry, and not only deprived Abi Bessdm of his office, but",141,book_6,

Ever after this, Abi Bessém, who followed the profession of the law,  became an object of ridicule to his comrades, who used to say to him, ‘‘ Thou  ‘* camest here, no doubt, to proclaim the doctrines of thy friend Télit.”   After the defeat of his two uncles, who disputed the empire with him, and  the eldest of whom, named Suleymdn Abt Ayib, fell in an encounter with his  troops in 183 (a.p. 799),™ Al-hakem turned his attention towards repelling the  attacks of the Christians on his territory. During the civil wars in which Al-hakem  had been engaged, the Christians, profiting by the separation of the Moslem troops  from their frontiers, had often assailed the defenceless points of the Mohammedan  territory, reduced the castles, led the inhabitants into captivity, and committed all  manner of ravages and depredations. But, in order to check their progress and  chastise their insolence, Al-hakem determined upon sending yearly expeditions  against them, and dispatched army after army, under the command of his best  generals, to waste their territory, and put every thing before them to fire and  sword. We shall here mention a few only of the memorable wars undertaken  during his reign.   In the year 192 (beginning Nov. 5, a. p. 807), Ludhwik, son of Carl, King of  the Franks, collected his forces, and marched to Turiasonah (Tarazona),% which  he besieged. Al-hakem sent against him his eldest son ’Abdu-r-rahman, who  defeated him, God Almighty being pleased that the Moslems should vanquish  their enemies. But, as the Franks became every day bolder on account of the  wars which Al-hakem had to sustain against the rebels of Toledo,* and were  assailing his frontiers, it was thought expedient to chastise their insolence. Ac-  cordingly, in the year 196 (beginning Sept. 22, a.p. 811), the Amir marched  against them in person, and, having invaded their country, took many of their  towns and fortresses, laid their lands waste, and followed them every where with  slaughter, captivity, and plunder ; returning afterwards to Cordova with the trophies  of his victory.   Four years after this, in the year 200 (beginning August 10, a. p. 815), Al-hakem  dispatched his Wizir, ’Abdu-l-kerim Ibn [’Abdi-l-wahed Ibn] Mugheyth, against  the Franks. The Moslems plundered the country, and razed several fortresses ;  but they were met by the King of the Galicians at the head of considerable forces.  Both armies then encamped on the banks of a river, and skirmished for several  days, the advantage remaining at first with the Moslems. At last, after thirteen  days of incessant fighting, the river, swollen by the heavy rains, overflowed its  banks, and the Moslems, though victorious, were compelled to retreat from the  field of battle.",142,book_6,
"    CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 105    In the year 197 (beginning Sept. 11, a. p. 812,) a most dreadful famine prevailed ee  : famine.  in Andalus, which so much affected the lower classes of people that they died by  thousands. In allusion to this calamity, a poet of the court of Al-hakem, named  ’Abbas Ibn Nasih”’ Al-jezayri (from Algeziras), composed these two verses :  “‘ Time has brought on sterility and famine, but the calamity itself has  “‘ proved a benefit to Al-hakem:  “It has insured his rule, and delivered him of many a rebellious sub-  ** ject.”   Of this poet [’Abbds] historians relate a very curious anecdote. They say that as  he was once travelling in the Thagher (the province of Toledo), he met at  Guadalajara with a woman who was crying out at the top of her voice, ‘“‘ Come  “to our help, O Al-hakem! for thou hast so neglected us of late, that the enemy  “ of God has fallen upon us, and deprived us both of husband and father.” Having  inquired of her the particulars of her sad loss, the woman acquainted Abi-1-’abbas  how she and her family, as they were returning from the fields [to Guadalajara], fell  in with a party of Christians on horseback, who killed or took prisoners all those  who went with her. This furnished Al-’abbés with a theme for that elegant  kasstdah of his which begins thus:   ‘* T was passing through Guadalajara in all haste, when I heard a plaintive  “sound issue from a house.   ‘“‘T listened, and heard a woman say, ‘O Abi-l-’assi! towards thee I guide  “ my exhausted camel, to thee I run for assistance and protection.’ ”   On his return to court, ’Abbds entered the presence of Al-hakem, and recited  the above poem, in which he admirably described the fear and consternation of  the inhabitants of the districts through which he had passed, and the words uttered  by the wretched woman whilst imploring his help. No sooner had Al-hakem  heard it, than he issued immediate orders to prepare for war, and three days  after he marched to Guadalajara, taking with him the poet Abbas. Arrived there,  he inquired from what part of the enemy’s country the marauding party had come;  and being informed of it, he invaded that district, laid waste the land, took many  fortresses, destroyed the fields, burnt the houses of the inhabitants, and committed  all kinds of ravages, inflicting death on a great number of infidels. After this he  returned to Guadalajara, where he summoned the widow to his presence, and,  causing the captives taken in his expedition to be brought before him, he had them  all beheaded before her eyes. This done, Al-hakem turned towards ’Abbas,  and said to him, ‘ Ask the widow now whether Al-hakem’s help is effectual, or  not.” She, being a well-bred woman, replied, ‘‘ No doubt of that; the Amir has  alleviated our sorrow, he has afflicted our enemies, and bestowed his assistance   VOL.

May God reward him for it, and make him happy!”  Hearing this, Al-hakem could not refrain from showing all the gratification and joy  which he felt at the compliment, and said to the poet, ‘‘ See, O Al-’abbas! how we  “have run, though we were distant, to this woman’s call; and how, collecting our  “* victorious forces, we have by our appearance soothed the grief and satisfied the  “ revenge of the injured, alleviated the sorrow of the afflicted, and relieved those  ‘* who were in difficulties.’—‘* True, O Amir!” replied ’Abbds; ‘‘ may the Al-  “ mighty reward thee for all the good thou hast done to the Moslems!” After  which he kissed the hand of his sovereign, and retired.   Al-hakem had five Wizirs, who were also the generals of his armies: their  names were, Is’h4k Ibn Al-mundhir, Al-’abbés Ibn ’Abdillah, ’Abdu-l-kerim Ibn  ’Abdi-l-wahed Ibn Mugheyth, who was also his Hajib, Foteys Ibn Suleyman, and  Sa’id Ibn Hossin. When he ascended the throne the office of Kadi of Cordova  was held by Mos’ab Ibn Imran, after whose death he appointed ""Omar Ibn  Busheyr. Then came Al-farej Ibn Katdnah, then Besher Ibn Katten, ’Abdullah  Tbn Misa, Mohammed Ibn Telid, Hémid Ibn Mohammed Ibn Yahya. His Katibs  were, Foteys Ibn Suleyman, ’Ittdf Ibn Zeyd, Hejaj Ibn Al-’okayli.   Al-hakem died about the end of the year 206 (May, a.p. 822), after a reign  of six-and-twenty years. He was then fifty-two years old, having been born in 154  (beginning Dec. 23, a.p. 771) of a concubine of Hish4dm, named Khazraf. The  impression of his seal was ‘‘ In God Al-hakem trusts, and is secure.” He was tall  and thin, of a very dark complexion, and had an aquiline nose. He left twenty  male children, and twenty female.   More than one historian has recorded the fact that Al-hakem was the first  monarch of his family who surrounded his throne with a certain splendour and  magnificence. He increased the number of mamelukes until they amounted to  five thousand horse and one thousand foot. Ibnu Khaldiin and others say that  he was also the first who introduced the practice of issuing a regular pay to the  troops ; that he formed magazines of arms and provisions ; increased the number of  his slaves, eunuchs, and servants; had a body-guard of cavalry always stationed  at the gate of his palace, and surrounded his person with a guard of mamelukes,  the number of which has already been stated. These mamelukes were called  Al-haras (the guard), owing to their being all Christians, or “foreigners. They  occupied two large barracks, with stables for their horses ; and one thousand of their  number were continually mounting guard on both banks of the river, close to  his palace. Al-hakem kept, moreover, several spies, who acquainted him with the  state of public opinion, while he himself conducted the affairs of his government,  surrounding himself with theologians, doctors, and other learned and honest",144,book_6,
"    CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 107    individuals. In this way he was enabled to transmit to his posterity a powerful  and well organized empire.   There are not wanting authors, like Ibn Hazm, who assert that Al-hakem was a  tyrant and a shedder of blood; for which reason all the learned and pious men  in his dominions set their faces against him. He put to death the pious and  learned theologian Abi Bekr Zakariyyé Ibn Yahya Ibn Mattar Al-ghossani, who,  during his residence in the East, had attended the lectures of Sufyén At-thtri and  Malik Ibn Ans, the latter of whom quoted him in his writings. This worthy man,  with many other doctors and learned men, was put to death by Al-hakem. He  is by others accused of having seized male children, and caused them to be  castrated. But whether the charge be true, or not, God only knows. He is said,  however, to have shown repentance of this and other acts towards the close of  his reign, and to have thenceforth desisted from all violence or oppression. May  God have mercy on him!   Al-hakem had a favourite whom he much loved; his name was Zeydd Ibn  *Abdi-r-rahman.*” Being one day in company with him, Al-hakem flew into a  violent passion with one of his eunuchs for presenting to him a petition which  he did not like to see, and ordered that the slave should immediately have his hand  cut off. No sooner had Al-hakem issued the order, than Zeydéd, who happened to  be present at the time, said to him, ‘‘ May God prosper the Amir. I was told by  ‘* Malik Ibn Ans, who held it from Rifa’h Ibn Katham, that ‘ whoever will refrain  “ from anger, and moderate his passions, shall be secure against the wrath of God  ‘©on the day of judgment.’” This in some measure appeased the anger of Al-  hakem, who said, ‘‘ Did Malik Ibn Ans really say so? ’—“ Yes, he did,”’ answered  Zeyéd; upon which Al-hakem remitted the sentence, and pardoned the offence  of his slave.   That he honoured the learned, and always showed the greatest respect for the Resreceoe  laws, which he never infringed, choosing for the office of Kadi those people only  who enjoyed the reputation of being honest and worthy of their trust, may easily  be proved by extracts from the historians of the time. ‘‘ In this year,” says  one, ‘‘ Al-hakem appointed to the charge of Kddt-l-jam’ah (supreme judge),  “‘ vacant by the death of Mos’ab Ibn ""Imran, a learned and virtuous theologian  “of the name of Mohammed Ibn Bashir. He was the son of Sa’id, son of Bashir,  “son of Sharahil Al-ma’4feri, an excellent and highly esteemed man, who had  “ likewise been supreme judge of Andalus during the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahman I.,  “‘and had shown such impartiality and zeal in the discharge of that responsible  “* office that his justice had become proverbial.” *!_ Being at Beja, of which city he  was a native, when Al-hakem was advised to appoint him to the vacant office, Ibn",145,book_6,
"    108 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    Bashir was summoned to the capital. In obedience to the commands of the Sultan,  Ibn Bashir repaired to Cordova. As he was journeying thither, he happened to  halt for the night at the house of a friend of his, who was a very pious and devout  man. Not knowing why he had been sent for, the conversation naturally turned  upon that topic, when Ibn Bashir expressed his opinion that it was the intention of  Al-hakem to appoint him Katib ; ** but his friend said to him, ‘“‘ Better than that ; |  “T think he destines thee for the office of Kéddt-l-jam’ah, now vacant by the  “death of the person who held it.”—‘ Should such be the case,” replied Ibn  Bashir, ‘‘ I will choose thee for my consul.”—‘ Willingly,”’ said his friend; ‘‘ but  “ before I accept thy offer, let me hear how thou wilt answer the three questions  ‘which I am now going to ask thee: first, How dost thou like to live well, to  ‘dress handsomely, and to be well mounted? ”—‘ By Allah! I care not for  “eating, except to appease my hunger; nor for dress, as long as my nudity is  “ covered: as to carriage, I want no other than my feet,” was Ibn Bashir’s reply.  “So far,” continued his friend, ‘‘ my first question is answered. Now to the  “ second: How dost thou like to see a’handsome face, or to gaze at a heaving  ‘* bosom, or at any other of the charms of the fair,*> and to indulge thyself in their  ‘* company ?””—‘‘ Those are pleasures which I have never tasted, and therefore  ‘*T shall nowise be disappointed if I am to be deprived of them.”—‘ That is  “the second. Now, how dost thou like to be praised and extolled by thy fellow-  “ citizens, and how dost thou like to be appointed to the office, and to be superseded  “ afterwards ?”»—‘‘ By Allah!” answered Ibn Bashir, ‘“ it is very indifferent to  ‘“me whether people praise me or vilify me, and I will neither rejoice at my  “‘ appointment, nor exhibit sorrow at my removal.”—‘‘ Well said!” exclaimed his  friend; ‘‘ my three questions are answered to my satisfaction, and I accept thy  ‘* offer: hasten now to Cordova, where the office of K4di awaits thee.” Ibn Bashir  accordingly arrived in the capital, and was appointed to the vacant office, as his  friend had foretold.   Ibn Wadhah says, ‘‘ I was told by a man who saw the Kédi, Ibn Bashir, enter  “ the great mosque on the first Friday after his nomination, that he was dressed in  “a cloak dyed of a deep yellow,* and wore sandals * on his feet: his loose hair  “* fell profusely on his shoulders. In this garb he preached and prayed [with  “the people], and afterwards sat to administer justice; and yet if any one  “* neglected to pay him proper respect, or forgot any of the formalities due to  ‘* his office, he invariably found him (in haughtiness of manner) more distant  “ than the Pleiades.** Upon one occasion a man came up to him, and seeing him  ‘« dressed like a gay youth, his hair scattered and uncombed, his deep-yellow cloak,  “* perceiving traces of kohol and tooth-powder*’ on his face, and of hinna on his",146,book_6,

I ask you who is the Kadi, and you point out to me  ‘a flute-player.’ °° However, as all assured him that such was the truth, the man  “came forward, and made his excuses, and approaching nearer to Ibn Bashir,  “ explained to him his case, and found him more just and impartial than he could  ‘ever have imagined. The business for which he had come being at an end, the  “man began to upbraid the Kadi in an amicable way for wearing his hair so long  “and untidy, and dressing in coarse raw silk, of a deep-yellow colour. Ibn Bashir  ‘* answered in the following words: ‘ I was told by Malik Ibn Ans, that Mohammed  “ Tbn Munkadir wore his hair as I do; and that Hish4m Ibn ’Orwah, a theologian  “* of Medina, used a deep-yellow cloak, like mine; and, lastly, that Al-kasim Ibn  ‘* Mohammed always dressed in coarse silken cloth, like this.’”   The same author (Ibn Wadhéh) further relates that Yahya Ibn Yahya [the  traditionist], being once asked what he thought of the turban, answered, ‘‘ That  ** the turban was the usual head-dress for men in the East, and that in ancient times  ‘« great importance was attached to it.” They then said to him, ‘ If thou use one,  “* people will not follow thy fashion.” To which he replied, ‘‘ Mohammed Ibn  ‘* Bashir dressed in silken cloth, and people did not imitate him; and yet, was Ibn  “« Bashir deserving that men should oppose him? Were I to put on a turban, people  “‘ would desert me as they did Ibn Bashir, and I should be without followers.”   One of the first acts of Ibn Bashir, after his appointment to the office of Kadi,  was to issue sentence against the Amir Al-hakem in a law-suit pending between  him and a citizen of Cordova, respecting the possession of a mill close to the bridge.  The suitor having fully proved his right, Ibn Bashir decided that Al-hakem was  not entitled to the property; upon which the Sultan summoned the party to his  presence, and, having asked him to name his price for it, gave him an order upon  his treasury. One of Al-hakem’s courtiers, named Musa Ibn Sema’h,® once came  up to him, to complain of Ibn Bashir, who, he said, had exceeded his authority, and  shown partiality against him. Al-hakem said to him, ‘I shall soon ascertain  ‘“‘ whether what thou tellest me be true or not. Go to him immediately, and ask  “‘ to be admitted to his presence. If he grant thy request, I believe thee, and he  ‘ shall be punished, and deprived of his office: if he does not, notwithstanding thy  ‘* importunities, my esteem for him shall increase tenfold; for I am sure he is not  ‘“‘ tyrannical, and truth is his only pursuit.” Misa did as he was commanded,  and repaired to Ibn Bashir’s residence. Al-hakem, however, ordered some of his  Sclavonian guards to follow Misa thither, and report to him what should take place",147,book_6,

Shortly after, one of them returned, and told Al-hakem how,  on the arrival of Misa at the house of Ibn Bashir, he had been received by a  porter ; who, after acquainting the Kadi with his presence, returned with a message  from him thus conceived: ‘‘ The Kadi begs me to say, that if thou hast any legal  “business with him, thou hadst better go to court at the hours he administers  “justice.” Hearing this, Al-hakem smiled and said, ‘‘ I well knew Ibn Bashir  ‘* to be an upright judge, having no partiality towards any one.”   Ibn Bashir held twice the office of Kadi, having been once deposed by Al-hakem,  who, however, soon after re-instated him in his office. After his removal, Ibn Bashir  quitted Cordova, and repaired to his native city. They relate that some time before  this took place, one of his comrades wrote, upbraiding him for his excessive  severity, and saying, ‘‘ If thou follow thy present course, I greatly fear thy re-  “ moval ;” and that Ibn Bashir answered him in these words: ‘‘ Would to God  “that I saw myself with my mule Ash-shakré on the road to Beja!” Shortly  after this, the Amir Al-hakem being greatly offended with him for calling witnesses  in a case in which one of his favourites was concerned, he was deprived of his  office,” and accordingly took the road to Beja, his native city. Ibn Bashir had  not proceeded long on his journey before one of the rakkds (runners) of the Amir  overtook him, and bade him return to Cordova. The word rakkds, used in the  West, is synonymous with As-s4’i. Al-hakem again intrusted that office to Ibn  Bashir, who, at first, would not accept it; but he was at last prevailed upon by  Al-hakem to resume his old functions. That Sultén, moreover, assigned him a  pension on his treasury, and gave him one of his slave girls.   Among the remarkable acts of justice of this Ibn Bashir, the following is one.  Sa’id Al-khayr, son of the Amir ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ad-ddkhel, having a law-suit  pending with another party, appointed a person to appear in his name at court,  and to represent him in all ways. The agent accordingly produced a deed signed  by several witnesses, all of whom were already dead, with the single exception  of the Amir Al-hakem, and another person living in Cordova. The latter witness  appeared in court, and gave his testimony in favour of Sa’id Al-khayr; but the  adverse party having insisted upon the appearance of another witness, Ibn Bashir  declared his application just, and complied with the request. Sa’id accordingly  repaired to the royal palace, and, presenting the deed to Al-hakem, showed him his  own testimony attached to it. The deed had been drawn before Al-hakem succeeded  to the throne and during his father’s lifetime; and therefore Sa’id, fearing that  its validity might otherwise be brought into question, requested him to affix a  note to it, stating it to have been signed with his own hand. Al-hakem had  the greatest esteem for his uncle, Sa’id Al-khayr, and wished justice to be done",148,book_6,
"    CHAP, I11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 111    unto him; he therefore said to him, ‘‘O uncle! we are not by our station called  ‘* upon to appear as a witness ; for certainly we have been invested in this world  “with a power and glory which no one can deny: we fear, moreover, that if  “‘ we comply with the Kadi’s request, and appear at his court, perchance we shall  “‘ sustain such an injury in our character and station as can only be followed by  “the loss of our kingdom. Go therefore to court, and try to persuade the Kadi  ‘‘ of thy right. If thou do not succeed, and he should decide against thee, appeal  “to me from his sentence, and I will instantly give thee redress.” Sa’id Al-  khayr refused, and said, ‘God be praised! What right has the Kadi to dispute  ‘* thy testimony, he being a creature of thine, and appointed to this office by thee ?  “No, I adjure thee by our religion to put thy signature on that paper, and to state,  ‘* besides, what thou well knowest to be the truth, without concealing any thing.”  “ Willingly,” replied Al-hakem, ‘‘ for thou hast addressed me in a way that leaves  “me no alternative but to comply with thy request: we would rather choose to  “be freed from the obligation; but if thou insist upon it we must needs grant  “ thy request, and write down such corroborating testimony as will leave no doubt  ‘“‘ whatever, and will induce the K4di to decide in thy favour.” Having then  summoned to his presence two of the most eminent lawyers of his capital, he wrote  down on a piece of paper his testimony, sealed it with his seal, and presented it to  them, saying, ‘‘ Here is my testimony under my own signature and seal; go with it  “to court, and show it to the K4di when he is about to examine the witnesses.”  The lawyers did as they were commanded, and delivered the paper to the Kédi,  who said to them, ‘I have heard of you, you are both men of integrity and justice.”  Shortly after, Sa’id’s agent made his appearance, and presented to him a new  affidavit,"") saying, ‘‘O Kadi! I hear thou hast received the Amir’s testimony ;  ‘* what sayest thou to it?” Ibn Bashir took the paper, and, after perusing its con-  tents attentively, said to the agent, ‘‘ This is the testimony; but I want to see the  “ attestant himself.” On hearing this, the agent’s amazement was complete; he  repaired immediately to his master Sa’id Al-khayr, and acquainted him with the  circumstance. Sa’id rode to the royal palace, and entering the presence of Al-  hakem, addressed him in these words: ‘‘ Our empire has disappeared, and our  “glory is vanished, since thou allowest this Kadi of thine to hold thy testimony  “in contempt. God has intrusted to thee the government of his servants, and  “made thee the arbiter of their lives and property; and an insult of this kind  “‘ should not be borne by one like thee.”” He then began to abuse the Kadi,  and tried to persuade Al-hakem to have him seized and put to death. But Al-  hakem said to him, ‘‘ Why am I to consider myself injured by such a proceeding ?  “O uncle! the Kadi is a pious and honest man, who does that which he con-",149,book_6,

He was originally  from Beja, then the abode of the Egyptian Arabs. Ibn Harith, citing an author  named Ahmed Ibn Khiéled, says that he made his first studies in Cordova; he then  became secretary to one of the sons of ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Merwén, of the royal  family of Umeyyah. Having quitted his service, he left Andalus on a pilgrimage,  and met Malik Ibn Ans, from whom he received instruction. After spending some  time at Cairo, wholly intent upon the acquisition of learning, he returned to his  native city (Beja), and devoted himself to the cultivation of an estate he had  inherited from his father. Of his virtues and praiseworthy deeds the historians  of his time make ample mention ; and a detailed account of his life and writings  may be found in the biographical work of Ibn ’Ayddh, entitled Al-muddrik, to  which we refer our readers, as the copy of it which we possess is in Africa among  our books.

Some Accession of  time before his death, Al-hakem, having summoned to his presence his Wizirs, vain Th  his courtiers, the generals of his armies, and the chiefs of the Arabian tribes,   exacted from them the oath of allegiance to his eldest son ’Abdu-r-rahman, whom   he appointed his successor. In case of death, he was to be succeeded by another of   his sons, called Al-mugheyrah. ’Abdu-r-rahman was then thirty years old.   Soon after his accession to the throne, ’Abdu-r-rahman invaded Galicia, where he Invasion of  remained for a considerable time, wasting the country, and annihilating its Christian Galicia  inhabitants. Owing to these and other victories which ’Abdu-r-rahmdn had  gained over the Christians and others during his father’s lifetime, his subjects  bestowed upon him the surname of Al-modhaffer (the victorious).   In the year 208 (beginning May 15, a.p. 823) he dispatched an expedition of Alava.  against the country of Alava and the Castles, under the command of his Hajib,  ’Abdu-l-kerim Ibn ’Abdi-l-wahed. This general ravaged the country, and destroyed  many towns that lay in his way; he likewise reduced by force of arms several of  the enemy’s fortresses, the inhabitants of some of which obtained security and  peace on condition of releasing all their Moslem captives and paying the customary  annual tribute.

After this, Ludheric, King of the  Galicians, (Alfonso II. of Leon,) having made an incursion into the district of  Medinah-Salim (Medinaceli) in the Thagher, Fortin Ibn Misa? marched against  him, gave him battle, and defeated him with a severe loss in slain and prisoners.  After this, Forttin proceeded to a fortress which the people of Alava had constructed  on that frontier for the purpose of annoying the Moslems, and, having laid siege to  it, took it and razed it to the ground.   After this,* ’Abdu-r-rahman in person led his army against the Galicians, whom  he defeated, subjugating their country, and taking a number of their castles. After  a long campaign, and several incursions made into the enemy’s territory, he  returned [to Cordova] with captives and plunder.   In the year 226 (beginning Oct. 30, a. p. 840) ’Abdu-r-rahmdn sent his army to  the country of the Franks, under the command of Misa Ibn Misa, governor of  Tuteylah (Tudela). Having penetrated into the country of Seritaniyah (Cerdagne),  Misa was met by the enemy, and a battle ensued, in which the Moslems fought  with desperation, until it pleased the Almighty to put their foes to flight. On  this occasion Misa’s conduct was worthy of great praise.   In the year 229 (beginning Sept. 29, a. p. 843) he sent his son Mohammed to  Pamplona in command of his army. Near that city Mohammed engaged the  infidels, and put to death their Lord, Garcia,* one of the greatest princes of the  Christians.   In the year 231 (beginning Sept. 6, a.p. 845) an army was dispatched to  Galicia. On this occasion, after subduing the country through which they pro-  ceeded, the Moslems arrived before the city of Leon, which they besieged, battering  its walls with war-engines, until the inhabitants deserted the city; upon which the  Moslems entered it, plundered whatever they found, and set fire to it. They then  attempted to demolish the walls, but could not accomplish their purpose, owing to  their solidity and strength, they being seventeen cubits in thickness: the Moslems,  however, succeeded in opening a great breach, and then departed. Some time  afterwards ’Abdu-r-rahman sent his forces to the country round Barcelona. His  Hajib, ’Abdu-l-kerim, who went in command of the expedition, after ravaging the  districts in the neighbourhood of that city, passed the defiles known by the name of  Al-bort (Porte), and penetrated into the country of the Franks, which he scoured  in every direction, slaying the inhabitants or taking them prisoners. He also  besieged Jerundah (Gerona), the great city [of those parts], and, after wasting the  neighbouring districts, returned [to Cordova].

"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 115    Constantinople, a city situated beyond the country of the Franks, sent presents to Greek ambas-  *Abdu-r-rahman, at the same time soliciting his friendship. The Greek, who had in Cordova.  of late been greatly harassed by the armies of Al-mamiun and Al-mu’tassem, asked  *Abdu-r-rahman to join forces with him against their common enemies of the house  of ’Abbés. To this end he tempted ’Abdu-r-rahman with the conquest of the  empire which his ancestors [of the house of Umeyyah] had possessed in the East ;  and in a letter which he addressed to him he entered more fully on the subject, and  explained his views and intentions. ’Abdu-r-rahman sent him a valuable present  in return by one of the most distinguished men of his court, named Yahya  Al-ghazzaél, who was renowned for his wisdom and his talents for poetry, and who  succeeded in forming an alliance between the two sovereigns. Thus did ’Abdu-r-  rahman’s renown grow even above that of the Beni Abbias.   Ibnu Hayyén relates, that, on his arrival at Constantinople, the King of the Rim  (the Emperor of Greece) showed great astonishment at his youthful appearance,  and was very much pleased with him: he invited him to partake of a repast with  him, but this Al-ghazzal refused on the plea that his religion forbade him to drink  spirituous liquors. As he was, upon a certain day, sitting in company with the  king, the wife of the latter came out [from the royal apartments] dressed in all her  finery,—a rising sun in beauty. Al-ghazzdl was so surprised that he could not  take his eyes from her; and although the king was talking to him at the time,  Al-ghazz4l paid no attention to what he said. The king, finding Al-ghazzal’s  behaviour very rude, directed his interpreter to ask him what he was about.  Al-ghazzal said to him, “Tell thy master that I am so captivated by the charms  ‘‘ of this queen, that I am prevented from listening to his conversation. Say to  “him that I never saw in all the course of my life a handsomer woman than she  “is.” He then began to describe one by one all her charms, and to paint his  amazement at her incomparable beauty, and concluded by saying that she had  captivated him with her black eyes. When the interpreter repeated his words to  the king, Yahya rose still higher in his favour, and the queen was delighted with  his words.   The above is not the only service on which Al-ghazzdl was employed by his  master, ’Abdu-r-rahman. Abt-l-khattdb Ibn Dih’yah relates, in his work entitled  Al-muttrib, that he was also sent [on an embassy] to the land of the Majus.®  Al-ghazzal was then very near his fiftieth year; but, though his hair was gray, he  had still all the appearance of youth and strength. The queen, whose name was  Tiida, having asked him one day what his age was, he answered in jest, ‘‘ Twenty.”  —‘ And how does it happen,” replied the queen, ‘that thou hast gray hair?”  Al-ghazz4l then ‘said, ‘‘ There is nothing extraordinary in that.

This Yahya Al-ghazzal was the son of Hakem; he belonged to the tribe of Bekr  Ibn Wayil, and was a native of Jaen: he was surnamed Al-ghazzal (the gazelle),  from his great beauty.’ Ibnu Hayydan, in his Muktabis, calls him the physician,  the poet, and the ’A’lim, or learned man, of Andalus. He was witty, and much  inclined to. satire. Having upon one occasion indulged his satirical propensities  against Ibn Nafi’, surnamed Zary4b, a favourite of ’Abdu-r-rahman, of whom  mention will occur hereafter, he was banished the kingdom. He then visited ‘Irak,  where he arrived shortly after the death of Abi Nowds. He lived to the age  of ninety-four, and died in the year 250 (beginning Feb. 12, a.p. 864), under  the reign of Mohammed, the son and successor. of ’Abdu-r-rahman, having known  five sovereigns of the house of Merwan; namely, ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ad-dakhel,  Hisham, Al-hakem, ’Abdu-r-rahman II., and his son Mohammed.   In the days of ’Abdu-r-rahman the Majiis (Northmen) made their appearance  upon the coasts of Andalus, and took possession of Seville. ’Abdu-r-rahman  having sent an army from Cordova against them, they left their ships, and engaged  the Moslem forces, which they defeated after a severe contest ; but on the arrival of  new re-inforcements from Cordova, the Moslems again attacked them, put them to  flight, and plundered and burnt some of their vessels. After this the Majis  proceeded to Shidhtinah (Sidonia), where they stayed for two days, collecting  plunder in the neighbourhood; but when they heard of the arrival of ’Abdu-r-  rahmdan’s fleet at Seville, they again took to their ships, and sailed towards the  coast of Liblah [Niebla], which they overran, carrying some of the inhabitants    - into captivity. Thence they went [by land] to Beja, and lastly to Lisbon, whence    Arrivals from  the East.    they put to sea, nothing more being afterwards known of them. This event ® took  place in the year 230 (beginning Sept. 17, a. p. 844), and Andalus was delivered  from their ravages. ’Abdu-r-rahmén visited the places which they had entered,  repaired the devastations they had committed, and, by increasing the garrisons,  secured the country against any future invasion of those barbarians.   During the reign of this Sultén several illustrious men left the East to settle in  Andalus. Among the rest was ’Ali Ibn Nafi’, surnamed Zary4b,® a celebrated  musician and singer, who had been a mauli of the Khalif Mahdi, and a pupil of  Ibrahim Al-maussili. He came from ‘Irak in the year 206 (beginning June 5,  A.D. 821), and was so well received by the Amir ’Abdu-r-rahman, that, according  to Ibnu Khaldin, that Sultan rode out to meet him on the day of his entrance into  Cordova, and honoured him extremely, distinguishing him above all his courtiers,  and granting him several favours. Zarydb settled in Andalus, and taught vocal",154,book_6,
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 117    music to the people of that country, founding a school of his own. He left several  children, the eldest of whom, named ’Abdu-r-rahman, inherited his talents, and  diffused his science among the people of Andalus.   We have already '° stated that owing to his master’s jealousy Zaryéb was obliged peeve  to quit Baghdad. He then repaired to Western Africa, where his talents soon singer.  acquired him as great a reputation as he had enjoyed in the East. Having there  heard of the magnificence displayed at the court of Al-hakem, and of the great  favours which that Sultan conferred on all those whom he took under his pro-  tection, he resolved upon writing to him a letter, in which he related to him his  adventure and dispute with Is’hék, and how that musician had given him his choice  [between exile and bitter enmity]. He likewise acquainted him with his inventions  in the art which he said his master had unduly appropriated to himself, and  concluded by asking his leave to come to Cordova and devote himself to his service.  Al-hakem was delighted at the offer, and sent a messenger to apprise Zaryab that  he might come whenever he pleased ; that he wished very much for his arrival, and  that he would not fail to reward his services as they deserved. The bearer of the  message was a Jewish musician, of the name of Mansir, who was attached in that  capacity to the Sultan’s household. Upon the receipt of this message, Zaryab  embarked with his family and children, and, sailing across the Bahru-z-zokdk (the  Straits of Gibraltar), landed at Algesiras. But when he had spent a few days  only at that port, the news came of the death of Al-hakem; and Zarydb decided  upon returning to Africa: but the Jewish musician, Manstir, who was with  him at the time, dissuaded him from his undertaking, and prevailed upon him to  offer his services to Al-hakem’s son and successor, ’Abdu-r-rahman. The Jew  therefore addressed a letter to the Amir, acquainting him with Zarydb’s case ; and  *Abdu-r-rahmén was so pleased, that he immediately answered, expressing his  satisfaction at his arrival, and requesting him not to delay his departure. He  then wrote to the governors of the districts and towns on his way to Cordova,  to treat him with every honour and respect, and furnish him with an escort and  provisions for his journey. When Zarydb approached the capital, the Sultdn sent  one of his chief eunuchs to meet him with mules and. provisions for himself His reception.  and family. On his arrival at Cordova, which happened at night, owing to the  women who came with him, Zaryaéb was lodged in a splendid mansion, where he  received every day whatever provisions he wanted for his maintenance and that  of his family, besides a khil’ah or dress of honour, which the Amir sent him.   Three days after this, Zaryab was summoned to the royal presence ; and ’Abdu-r-  rahman was so pleased at the interview, that he immediately assigned him a pension  of two hundred dinars per month on his treasury, and to each of his four sons,",155,book_6,
"    118 ‘ HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    *Abdu-r-rahmén, Ja’far, Obeydullah, and Yahya, twenty dinars per month. He  ordered besides that three thousand dinars yearly should be paid to him by way of  gratuity’ at certain festivals: namely, one thousand dinars at each of the two  ""Ids,"" five hundred at nauruz (new year’s day), and five hundred at mahrajdn  (midsummer), and that he should be provided annually with three hundred mudd of  grain; namely, two-thirds of barley, and another third of corn: and lastly, he gave  him several houses, as well as part of the produce of certain duties raised in  Cordova and the neighbouring gardens, besides lands; all which united brought  him in a clear revenue of forty thousand dinars.  He becomes a ‘When all Zaryab’s requests had been granted according to the Amir’s promise,  ag and the latter saw that he had captivated the heart of the musician by his excessive  liberality, he began to admit him to his privacy, and to invite him to evening  parties, to drink palm-wine and sing to music. So delighted was ’Abdu-r-rahman  with Zaryab’s performance [on the first occasion], that he would listen to no other  singer of the many who attended his court, and that he conceived an unbounded  ’ affection for him, going so far as to closet himself with him, and make him sit by  his side, as if he were his equal, and allowing him to treat him with the greatest  freedom. On such occasions, after listening to his songs for some time, ’Abdu-r-  rahmén would ask him to tell him stories ; and Zaryab, who was deeply read and well  informed, and who was, moreover, gifted with a prodigious memory, would entertain  him with anecdotes of Kings and Khalifs, and the remarkable sayings of the wise,  of which he possessed an inexhaustible store, only to be compared in extent with a  boundless sea. Every day the Amir became more attached to him, and more  astonished at what he related, until he would have him at his meals, and honoured  him by allowing him to dine with him and with those among his sons who were  then grown up. He then ordered his Katib or secretary to draw up a deed, [which  he signed,] by which he granted him all the pensions and gifts above mentioned ;  and when in the course of time his attachment for him became still stronger,  he caused a private door to be made, by which Zarydb might enter his apartment  {unperceived].   They relate that Zaryab used to say that the Jinn taught him music every night,  and that, whenever he was thus awakened, he called his two slave girls, Ghazzalan  and Hindah, made them take their lutes, whilst he also took his, and that they  passed the night conversing, playing music, and writing verses, after which they  hastily retired to rest. In like manner it is related of Ibréhim Al-maussili, in his  admirable work on melody entitled Al-makhirt,"" that the Jinn held conversations  with him; but God only is all-knowing.   Improves the Before Zarydb’s time the lute was, according to the old fashion, composed of    Inte,",156,book_6,
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 119    four strings only, which answered to the four elementary principles of the body,  and expressed the four natural sounds. Zarydb, however, added to it another  red string, which he placed in the middle, by which addition the instrument  was considerably improved, and a more harmonious sound than before pro-  duced. The arrangement stood thus: the treble or first string, which was dyed  of a bright yellow, supplied in the lute the place of the bile in the human  body: the next string to it, which was red, supplied the place of the blood; it  was twice as thick as the treble, on which account he called it muthanna, i. e.  double: the third was left undyed, and was consequently white, being intended as a  representative of the phlegm in the human body; in size it was double the  muthanna or second string, for which reason it was called muthallath or triple:  the fourth, which was black, was intended to occupy in the instrument the same  place as the black humours in the body of man; it was also called bam, and was  the largest of all; in thickness it was double the third string. These four strings  answered completely to the four natural sounds, harmony resulting from the balance  of their opposite properties. The bam, being hot and dry, was opposed to the  muthanna, which was hot and damp, and thus a balance was produced; the zeyr,  being hot and dry, matched the muthallath, which was hot and damp; so that  every nature met with its opposite property, until it was balanced, and the equili-  brium was established, as in the body of man, by the counteraction of the contrary  elements of which it is composed. One thing, however, was wanting, which was  the soul, which co-exists with the blood; wherefore Zarydb added by the side of  the string representing the blood a fifth one, which he placed in the middle, that is  to say, under the muthallath and above the muthanna, thus supplying the place of  the soul in the human body, and improving the four notes of the lute.   The above was not the only improvement devised by Zaryab in this department  of music: he also introduced the use of eagles’ talons instead of the wooden  plectra which were formerly in use, and this he did on account of the soft down  which covers the claw of that bird, its cleanness and lightness applied to the  fingers, and the greater durability of the strings when touched by this method,—  a consideration not to be neglected by a man who, like Zaryab, made so frequent a  use of his instrument.   Music, however, was not the only accomplishment of Zaryib. He was likewise  learned in astronomy, in geography or the division of the earth into seven climates,  the various productions peculiar to each of them, their temperature, their inter-  vening seas, the order and population of the several countries. He was deeply  versed in every branch of art connected with music ; and was, moreover, gifted with  such a prodigious memory that he knew by heart upwards of one thousand songs",157,book_6,
"    120 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    with their appropriate airs ; a greater number even than that recorded by Batlomius  (Ptolemy), who [first] established rules on the science of music, and wrote upon it.  Zaryd4b, moreover, was gifted with so much penetration and wit ; he had so deep an  acquaintance with the various branches of polite literature; he possessed in so  eminent a degree the charms of conversation, and the talents requisite to entertain  an audience; he could repeat such a number of entertaining stories; he was so  acute and ingenious in guessing at the wants of his royal master,—that there never  was either before or after him a man of his profession who was more generally  beloved and admired. Kings and great people took him for a pattern of manners  and education, and his name became for ever celebrated among the inhabitants  of Andalus. We shall here give an instance of his immense popularity. At the  time Zarydb entered Andalus it was the fashion among the people of that country,  both men and women, to wear the hair over the upper part of the forehead,  and hanging down between the temples and the eye; but when they observed  that Zary4b, and his sons, and his wives, all wore their hair parted in the middle,  and not covering the forehead, the extremities being placed behind the ears and  falling over the temples, just in the manner used now by eunuchs and concubines,  they all relinquished the old fashion, and adopted that which he had introduced.   He taught the people of Andalus to extract the murtak from the murddsang “ or  litharge, to take away the fetid smell of the arm-pits, and for the other purposes  for which that substance is employed. Before his time the kings of Andalus used  to have their clothes washed in water of roses and other garden flowers, the con-  sequence of which was that they never looked quite clean. He taught them  the use of salt [mixed with the above], through which the linen was made clear  and white. When the experiment had been tried, every one approved of it, and  praised Zaryab for the invention. He was the first who gathered and ate the  vegetable called hilyaun, and by the people of Andalus asfaraj (asparagus), which  was unknown to the inhabitants of that country before his arrival. A dish called  at-tafdyd, made of force-meat balls and small triangular pieces of paste, fried in oil  of coriander-seed, was also of his invention; and to this day (says the author  from whom this account is borrowed) a fried dish, greatly resembling the one  above described, bears still in Andalus the name of takalliyah Zarydb (the fried  dish of Zary4b). He likewise taught the people of Andalus to use vessels of  crystal instead of gold and silver; to sleep on a soft couch of prepared leather  in preference to cotton blankets; to dine from small leathern trays rather than  from wooden tables, owing to the greater cleanliness of the former, it being easier  to rub out the dirt from leather than from wood. Change of clothing according  to the different seasons of the year was another of the improvements intro-",158,book_6,
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 121    duced by Zary4b. Before his time the inhabitants of Andalus began to leave off  coloured or winter clothes, and to put on white or summer ones, on the day of  mahrajdn (midsummer), which the people of that country call ’ansarah,’® and which  falls on the 24th day of the solar month called Junoh (June) by the Christians.  They kept on white or summer clothing until the first day of the solar month of  Oktubir (October), that is to say, for a little more than three months ; the remainder  of the year they wore coloured or winter clothing. Zarydb, however, was of opinion  that in the season intervening between summer and winter, and which they called  rabi’ (spring), they should wear jubbas'® of coloured silk, or made of the stuffs  called mulham and muharr ; and waistcoats of light materials without any lining,  owing to their proximity to white or summer clothes, which the people used on  account of their lightness and their similarity to the mihshah, or usual cloak of  the lower classes. In the same manner he imagined that it would be convenient  towards the end of summer and the beginning of autumn to put on a mihshah, like  those of Meru [in Persia], and clothes of only one colour, and other similar articles  of light-coloured dress, thickly lined and wadded, to be worn chiefly in the morning  when the cold began to be sharp. On the approach of winter, however, people  were to leave off the above articles of dress, to put on warmer clothing of different  colours, lined, whenever the weather required it, with various kinds of fur.   The method which he employed with his disciples was this: whenever a youth  came to him for the purpose of taking lessons in vocal music, he made him sit  down on the round cushion called masirah, and bade him exert the full power of  his voice. If his voice was weak, he made him tie a turban round his waist,—  a practice which is well known to increase the voice, as it thus meets with no  impediment on its passage from the chest to the mouth. If the youth stammered,  or could not well open his mouth, or if he had the habit of clenching his teeth  whenever he spoke, he bade him put inside his mouth a small piece of wood three  inches in width, which he was to keep there day and night until his jaws were  well expanded.

Yahya, therefore, quitted Andalus at the age of twenty-  eight, and arrived at Medina, then the residence of that illustrious divine, under  whose guidance he immediately placed himself. They relate that whilst he was  one day attending his lessons together with other pupils, an elephant happened  to pass before the door of the house in which they were, and there was a cry,  “‘ Here is the elephant!” when all those present rushed out to see it, with the  exception of Yahya, who kept his seat. When Malik saw this, he said to him,  ‘“« Why dost thou not go out like the rest? surely there are no elephants in thy  “‘ country !”—‘‘ I came not from Andalus to the East,” replied Yahya, ‘“‘ to look at  “ elephants ; I came to see thee, who hast not thy like in my native country, and  “to profit by thy learning and thy experience.” Malik was very much struck by  this answer, and is reported to have exclaimed, ‘‘ This man is the wise man of  Andalus!” an expression which is said to have given rise to that saying so common  among the people of that country, ‘‘ Yahya is the ’A’lim (learned man) of Andalus ;  *Is4 Ibn Dinér is its Faquih (theologian) ; and ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Habib, its Ulema  (doctor).” Others give this differently, and call Yahya the Muhadith” (traditionist)  of Andalus.   Tbn Abi-l-fayddh relates a very curious anecdote of this Yahya. He says, the  Amir ’Abdu-r-rahman IT., having once assembled the chief theologians of Cordova  in the hall of his palace with a view to consult them upon a case of conscience,  stated that he had been guilty of entering his harem on one of the nights of  Ramadhdn, but that he had since most sincerely repented of what he had done, and  wished to know how he could atone for his guilt, or what penance they would  impose upon him. Yahya, who was one of those convoked, said, ‘‘ Let two  “consecutive months of fasting be thy penance, O Amir!” When the other  theologians heard Yahya utter this decision, they made no observation whatever ;  but as they were going out of the palace one of them said to him, ‘‘ Does not the  “‘ sect of Malik leave an option in similar cases? ”—‘‘ Certainly it does,” replied  Yahya, ‘‘ but had we left the Amir that gate to escape through, we should have  “* shown him the way to sin every day by infringing the law one day and repenting  “the next; and therefore we have thought it best at once to impose on him the  “ severest chastisement, that he may not wilfully sin again.” Accordingly he would  remit nothing of his penance, which ’Abdu-r-rahmén kept most scrupulously,  fasting all the time as he was prescribed. As we have stated elsewhere, Yahya  took part in the revolt of the western suburb of Cordova against the Amir Al-  hakem ; he contrived, however, to escape the vengeance of the Sultén, and fled to  Toledo, where he lived for some time in concealment, until Al-hakem, hearing",160,book_6,

He left a son  named ’Isé, who imitated him in learning and virtues, and who was the father  of a numerous progeny well known in Cordova as the Beni Yahya. To this number  belonged Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Yahya Al-leythi, who left Cordova for  the East in 313 (beginning March 28, a.p. 925), and after passing many years at  Cairo and Mekka, at both which places he met with many eminent divines, returned  to his native city, where he enjoyed great reputation. The Sultan ’Abdu-r-rahmdn  An-nésir appointed him to be Kadi of Elvira and Bejennah ; after which he named  him to the office of Kadi-l-kodé, or supreme judge at Cordova, in 326 (beginning  Nov. 7, a. D. 937).   In the month of Ramadhan of the year 238 (a. p. 853) died, at Cordova, the Desh of |  celebrated theologian Abi Merwén ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Habib, the author of I> Habib.  numerous works on all branches of science, but chiefly on traditional sayings,  jurisprudence, and the ritual of Malik Ibn Ans, whose disciple he had been. The  principal of these is his Al-wddhehatu ft madhhebi Mdlik (clear demonstrations  on the sect of Malik), a book which has always been, and must continue to be,  in the hands of every true believer. He wrote also on rhetoric, grammar, and  history ; and some say that although he was only fifty-three years old when he  died, he left nearly one thousand works on different subjects.   We have elsewhere alluded to the introduction of the rite of Mélik Ibn Ans and in introdeniog  the rejection of that of Al-auza’i in Andalus, upon which event various opinions are {r¢,¢¢t f  entertained by the authors who have treated on the subject; but we shall here  transcribe the words of the Hafedh Ibn Hazm relative to that occurrence. ‘‘ There  ‘are two religious sects, which, from the very period of their onset, were sur-   ‘* rounded with power and splendour, and spread rapidly among the people,—we  ‘* mean the sect of Abii Hanjifah and the sect of Malik Ibn Ans ; the former, because  ‘‘ when Abii Yusuf was appointed Kadi, he was intrusted with full powers to name  “ all the Kadis in the countries subject to the rule of Isl4m, from the most remote  ‘* provinces in the East to the frontiers of Eastern Africa, and therefore he only  ‘“‘ appointed those among his friends and disciples who professed his doctrines.  “‘ The same happened with Yahya Al-leythi among us; for that eminent theologian  “having gained the favour of the Sultén, who approved of his doctrines, he was  ‘* consulted upon every occasion ; and no Kadi was appointed without his consent,  “with this singularity, that Yahya himself would never accept office; so that  “in a very short time the administration of justice was completely in the hands  “ of the friends and disciples of Yahya, or those who, like him, professed the sect  “ of Malik.

God only knows the truth of the case!   *Abdu-r-rahmdn died in the month of Rabi-l-akhar of the year 238 (June 22,  A.D. 852), after a reign of thirty-one years.'° He was born at Toledo in the month  of Sha’bén of the year 176 (Nov. or Dec. a.p. 792); his mother’s name was  Halawah. He is commonly designated under the surname of Al-ausatt (the middle  one), to distinguish him from his great-grandfather, Abdu-r-rahmén Ad-dakhel  [the first], as well as from his great-grandson ’Abdu-r-rahmdn An-ndsir lidini-  Ilah [the third]. Owing to his success in war and his numerous victories over  the infidels, he was called by his subjects Abi-l-motref, (the victorious). He  was well versed on all points of Mohammedan law, and learned in the philo-  sophical sciences.” His reign was one of peace and splendour. Under his wise  administration the revenue of Andalus was considerably increased. Ibnu Sa’id  says, that before his time the amount of taxes had never exceeded six hundred  thousand dinars, but that, soon after his accession, they were increased to one  million. However, there are various and contradictory opinions as to the amount  of the revenue possessed by the Sultans of Andalus, and we ourselves have else-  where given a different statement.”   *Abdu-r-rahmén expended large sums in building palaces,* and laying out  pleasure-gardens, which he supplied with water from the distant mountains,  collecting what remained [after irrigation] in large cisterns.* He constructed  every where bridges, and caused mosques to be erected in the principal towns  of his dominions; his subjects imitating every where his passion for building.  He likewise added two porches to the great mosque of Cordova, but died without  completing the work, which was finished by his son Mohammed. Alluding to  this, a poet of his court, named Abi-l-mothanna, once said,—   “‘ Thou hast built to God the best of houses, one whose description no  “ mortal can attempt :   “To it the pilgrims resort from all parts of the world, as if it were the  “sacred temple of Mekka.   ‘Indeed its mihrdb, when examined all round, will be found to contain  “rokn (angles) as well as makdm (standing place).” *   Another poet has said, with still greater elegance,—   “The mosque which he has consecrated to God is without equal in the  “* world.",162,book_6,
"    CHAP. IV.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 125    ‘* Neither the mosque of ’Abdu-r-rahmén, nor that erected at Mekka by the  “* best of messengers, Mohammed, [can be compared to it.]   “* Indeed, its red and green columns shine like so many blocks of ruby and  ‘* emerald.  - “ O thou, the firm believer in God, mayest thou live and prosper! may  ‘* power and success for ever be thy lot!” *   *Abdu-r-rahman is reported to have introduced some new regulations respecting  royalty, one of which was, that he always veiled himself whenever he appeared  in public.” He left two hundred children, one hundred and fifty of which were  males, and the rest females. He used a seal on which was engraved the following |  pious motto: ‘‘ The servant of the merciful (’Abdu-r-rahmdn) rests contented on  the decrees of God.” This gave afterwards occasion to the two following verses of  a poet :   “The seal of the Amir shows him to be superior in wisdom to any of his  ‘* predecessors, since the inscription on it is—   “The servant of the merciful awaits in conformity and satisfaction the  “ decrees of his master.” ”   ’Abdu-r-rahman was the first who invented this motto, which the Sultdns of  his posterity preserved: he was endowed with great penetration and wit. Among  his remarkable sayings the following is one: ‘‘ Authority and honour are eagerly  “sought by people who know not their worth; hence the first thing they meet  ‘“‘ with is disappointment.”   He was very fond of women, and especially of a mistress of his named Tardb,® to His passion for  whom he was passionately attached. She it was, who being angry with him, owing  to some offence she had received at his hands, was never appeased until he caused  the door of her apartment to be blocked up with bags of money. On another  occasion he made her a present of a dress worth one hundred thousand dinars ;  and, on his being remonstrated with, and told that such a jewel ought never to  have been taken out of the royal treasure, he replied with this verse,—   ‘“« She who wears it is still of a higher value and greater estimation, more  ‘‘ adorned by jewels, and of a nobler origin.”  The following two verses were also composed by ’Abdu-r-rahm4n in honour of  this mistress :  ‘« When the sun rises every day to give us light, it reminds me of Tarib.  “‘ T am the happiest of mortals, since I am successful in love and prosperous  “in war.” 3!   Having once departed on an expedition to Galicia, and being a long time absent,   he wrote to her the following lines :",163,book_6,
"    His adventure  with Tardb,    126 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    “‘ The enemy called me away from thy side, and I flew to the battle like the  “ arrow shot from the bow.   “ How many deserts did I cross! and yet one obstacle after another came  “ to obstruct my path.   “Wherever I go I am tormented by the poison of absence ; the stones even  “ are melted through compassion [at my grief].   “ God is working [through me] the triumph of the true faith, which I am  “< spreading in spite of the worshippers of the crucified.   ‘« Against the infidels I now march, and my invincible host covers the  “ mountains and the plains.”   The story of the money-bags, as related by a contemporary historian, runs thus :  “ Tardb, fancying that she had been slighted by ’Abdu-r-rahmén, confined herself  “to her room, and refused to come out to the Amir, who, being desperately in  ‘love with her, was very much grieved at her resolution, and made all possible  “endeavours to make up the quarrel. Seeing, however, that all his entreaties  ‘were in vain, ’Abdu-r-rahman dispatched one of his chief eunuchs with orders  “ to compel her to appear before him; but this attack she also resisted by shutting  “the door of her outer apartment in the face of the eunuch, and declaring that  “* she would not stir out of her room, though it were to avoid death. The eunuch  ‘* then returned, and having informed ’Abdu-r-rahméan of the occurrence, as well as  “* of the girl’s determination, asked his permission to break the door open; but,  ‘instead of adopting such a violent measure, the Amir caused the door of her  ‘‘ apartment to be blocked up with bags of dirhems, after which he repaired thither  ‘in person, and tried by kind words to soothe her anger, promising, if she would  “come to a reconciliation, to present her with all the treasure heaped up before  ‘‘her door. To this Tartib consented, and opened her door accordingly, causing  ‘the money-bags to be carried into her room: she then threw herself down on  “ her knees, and kissed ’Abdu-r-rahman’s feet. The money she kept ; and although  “it amounted to such a sum as it would have been wearisome to count, no  ‘* portion of it ever returned to the royal treasure.”   *Abdu-r-rahman also loved tenderly two concubines of his, whose names were  Mudathirah and Ashifé, both of whom he had liberated and married. As to his  mistress Kalam, she was an excellent scholar, who wrote a very good hand, recited  poetry, knew many historical facts by heart, and had considerable learning in  various branches of literature. She was likewise a proficient in music and singing,  which ’Abdu-r-rahmén loved above all other recreations, as would appear from the  manner in which he treated the musician Zaryéb. The histories of the time abound  with anecdotes concerning this prince, which we omit here for the sake of brevity.",164,book_6,
"    CHAP, Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 127    After the death of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, his son Mohammed succeeded him. The first ores  act of his reign was to send forth an army under the command of Misa Ibn Misa,  governor of Tudela, which ravaged the territory of Alava and the Castles, and  took some fortresses. He also dispatched another army to the districts of Bar-  celona and more remote regions beyond that city, which wasted the land, took  some of the fortresses belonging to the former district, and then returned.* In His ware with  the mean while the rebels of Toledo, having sought and obtained the assistance of  the Kings of Galicia and Biscay, Mohammed went out in person against them, and,  having met them near the Wada-salit (Guadacelete),* made them fall into ap With the rebels  ambush which he had prepared, and slew twenty thousand Toledans and twenty  thousand infidels.   In the year 245 (beginning April 7, a. p. 859) the ships of the Majis appeared  again on the coast of Andalus, where they were met by Mohammed’s fleet, which  took from them two ships and sank some others, although in this encounter a  great many Moslems fell martyrs for the faith.**   In the year 247 (beginning March 16, a. p. 861) Mohammed caused an invasion  to be made into the territory of Banbilinah (Pamplona), which country was then  governed by a chieftain named Garsiah Ibn Unekoh,* (Garcia, son of Ifigo,) who  had for an ally Ordhin Ibn Adefunsh (Ordofio I). After ravaging the districts  round Pamplona, taking several fortresses, and subduing the whole country, the  Moslems returned, bringing Fortin, one of the sons of Garcia, a prisoner to  Cordova, where he remained twenty years in captivity.   In the year 251 (beginning Feb. 2, a.p. 865) Mohammed dispatched his son  Al-mundhir with an army to the territory of Alava and the Castles, which he  wasted, committing all manner of ravages and depredations. The Christian king,  Ludherik * (Alfonso III.), having attempted to stop the progress of the Moslems,  was defeated with great loss in killed and prisoners ; indeed, the victory gained on  this occasion was most splendid.   In the same year (a. H. 251) Mohammed in person led an army against the  inhabitants of Galicia, whose country he traversed and wasted in every direction ;  and two years after, in 253 (beginning Jan. 10, a.p. 867), he also caused an  incursion to be made into the territory of the infidels.**   In the year 254 (beginning Dec. 31, a. p. 867) the city of Merida was destroyed  and deserted by its inhabitants; no vestige whatever remaining of that once opulent  city. The cause of its destruction was the repeated insurrections of which the  inhabitants had been guilty during the reign of this Sultan, as well as that of  his father and predecessor.** A certain writer pretends to have heard in the East  the following verses, predicting the fate of Merida, many years before that wealthy",165,book_6,

The  author of the verses is not known.  ‘Woe to Merida! the rebellious city which rears its presumptuous head  “ against the lords of the age!  “ Though its inhabitants [now] enjoy every luxury and comfort, it will soon  ‘* be as dreary as a desert.  “* Woe, woe to Merida! the day that the Sultan shall appear with his forces  ‘ before her walls !’’*°   In the year 263 (beginning Sept. 23, a. p. 876) Mohammed again sent his son,  Al-mundhir, to the theatre of war, and in the ensuing year (a.H. 264) to the  territory of Pamplona, which he wasted. In 268 (beginning July 31, a.p. 881),  having ordered him to attack the enemy, Al-mundhir invaded the Christian  territory, and returned [to Cordova] victorious, after taking several castles, and  collecting considerable spoil.’   In the same year (a. H. 268) a dreadful earthquake was felt in Cordova, accom-  panied by violent gusts of wind, which threw down houses, towers, and minarets.  It began at the hour of al-maghreb (setting sun), and when the people were at  prayers. It was attended with thunder and lightning, and, to complete the awful  scene, large dense clouds overhung the city, and enveloped it in darkness. So  loud and terrific were the claps of thunder, and so often repeated, that the people  collected in the great mosque were seized with irrepressible fear; six of them dying  on the spot, whilst the rest of the assembly began to fly in all directions, leaving  their prayers unfinished. The Imém alone, and a few devout men, remained at  their post, intent upon their devotions as before. Mean while the mountains were  rent asunder, the castles and palaces were levelled with the dust ; the birds left their  nests in the branches of the trees, and the wild beasts forsook their dens; the  inhabitants, fearing they might be buried under the crumbling roofs, fled to the  open country, and there knelt down to invoke the mercy of the Almighty. It  was a scene of unparalleled confusion and heart-rending calamity.   After a reign of thirty-five years, the Amir Mohammed died in the month of  Safar *? of the year 273 (July or August, a. p. 886). He was born in 207 (beginning  May 26, a. p. 822). His mother’s name was Kahtaz.   Mohammed was a lover of science, which he himself cultivated with success.  When Baki Ibn Mokhlid returned to Cordova with the work of Ibn Abi Sheybah,""  and began to expound the doctrines of that theologian, a great number of doctors  raised their voices against him, condemned his opinions as dangerous and contrary.  to the spirit of the established religion, and went so far as to create such dis-  turbances whenever he offered to lecture on the subject, that Baki could not be",166,book_6,
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 129    heard in public. When the Amir Mohammed was informed of this he summoned  Baki as well as his adversaries to his presence, and had the book entirely read to  him, part by part, from beginning to end, that he might estimate its contents and  decide upon its merits. No sooner was the reading completed than he sent for his  chief librarian, and said to him, ‘“ Take that book, and have it transcribed for our  “own use; its merits are such that we will not be deprived of it for a single  “moment.” He then addressed Baki in these words: ‘‘I see thy learning, and  “‘ approve of thy doctrines ;”’ after which he issued orders that Baki should not  be molested or opposed in the free delivery of his opinions. The histories of  Andalus abound with anecdotes relating to this Baki, whose name has gone down to  posterity as that of a man of matchless piety and immense learning. We shall  here transcribe the words of an author.   Baki Ibn Mokhlid Ibn Yezid, surnamed Abi ’Abdi-r-rahman Al-kortobi, the  author of the Tefstr“ and Mesnad, was one of the most eminent traditionists of his  time. When still young he left Andalus for the East, and visited the principal  cities of Asia and Africa in search of learning. He went to Mekka, Medina, Cairo,  Damascus, Baghdéd, Kifah, Basrah, &c., where he failed not to see and converse  with the most eminent theologians, putting down in writing whatever he heard,  until the number of his masters is said to have amounted to two hundred and  thirty-four. He was exceedingly austere in his living, and exemplary in his  conduct. Al-kusheyri relates of him the following anecdote. ‘‘ A woman came once  “‘ to Baki to say how her son had been taken prisoner by the Franks, and that she  “could not sleep at night for love of him. ‘I possess a small house,’ said she,  ‘« “which it is my intention to sell, and with its produce to proceed to the country  ‘where he is kept a prisoner, to obtain, if possible, his liberation; for my rest  ‘* is disturbed, and my joy is embittered for the love of him. I want thy advice on  “this emergency.’—‘ Willingly,’ said Baki; ‘leave me for a moment, and I will  “ reflect upon what is to be done.’ The woman retired, and Baki began to pray  “ fervently for the accomplishment of the mother’s wish and the speedy liberation  ‘of her son. Some time after this the woman made her appearance together with  ‘her son, and spoke thus to Baki: ‘May God have mercy on thee! thy pious  “« interference has been the means of liberating my son.’ She then bade her son  ‘* tell him how he had obtained his liberty, upon which the youth said, ‘I was the  ‘* king’s slave, and used to go out daily with my brother slaves to certain works on  ‘‘ which we were employed. One day as we were proceeding all together to that  ‘* spot, I felt all of a sudden as if my fetters were being knocked off ; I looked down  “to my feet, when lo! I saw the heavy irons fall down broken on each side.   VOL. II. 8",167,book_6,
"    130 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    “« Seeing this, the inspector who was with us came up to me, and charged me with  “ knocking off my irons, and trying to escape; but I assured him upon my oath  “‘ that I had entertained no such design, and that my fetters had fallen off suddenly  ‘‘ without my being aware of it, or knowing how it could be accomplished. He  “then sent for the smith, and commanded him again to rivet the irons on my  ‘feet, and to strengthen them with additional nails, which was done; but no  ‘sooner did I rise on my feet than the fetters fell again. The Christians then  ‘‘ consulted their priests on the miraculous occurrence, and one of them came to  “‘ me and inquired whether I had a father. I said, ‘I have no father, but I have  “a mother.’—‘ Well, then,’ said the priest to the Christians, ‘ God, no doubt, has  “ listened to her prayers ; set him at liberty:’ which they immediately did.’”  ere Some time before his death, Mohammed had appointed his son Al-mundhir,  throne. surnamed Abi-l-hakem, to be his successor in the empire. Accordingly, no sooner  had the Amir breathed his last than messengers were dispatched to his son, who  was then absent with the army, apprising him of his father’s death, and requesting  him to repair to Cordova. Al-mundhir did so, and was publicly sworn on Sunday  the third of Rabi’-l-awal (August 7, a. p. 886,) at the hour of noon.*® The reign of  Al-mundhir, however, was of short duration, and mostly spent in war with the  rebel Omar Ibn Hafstin, a man of Christian origin, who rose during the lifetime of  his father, and whose craftiness and perfidy are sufficiently demonstrated in the  histories of that time. Upon one occasion Al-mundhir besieged him in one of his  strongholds, and so pressed him on all sides, that the rebel could not escape.  Seeing himself completely surrounded, and having no hope of deliverance, Omar  had recourse to the following stratagem. He sent a messenger to Al-mundhir,  offering to surrender, and to reside at Cordova, on condition that his life should be  spared, and that the Sultén would pledge his word not to molest him or deprive him  of his property. Al-mundhir granted his request ; and causing the necessary letters  of forgiveness and safe conduct to be issued to him and to his followers, received  them in his tent, and treated them with the greatest kindness. ’Omar then humbly  asked for a certain number of beasts of burden to carry his baggage to Cordova; -  which was also granted, one hundred mules being put at his disposal, besides  ten companies of cavalry to escort his family to that capital. Mean while several  K4dis and theologians, who had attended the expedition, seeing the war at an end,  took advantage of the convoy, and returned to Cordova; but Omar, who meditated  treason, followed them at some distance with a band of desperate outlaws, like  the hawk hovering over his prey; and when he saw the opportunity, he pounced  upon the convoy, slew the guards, released his family and treasures, and again",168,book_6,

With this man Al-mundhir had to fight many a pitched   battle; but, after defeating him in several partial encounters, Al-mundhir fell a   victim to his intrepidity, and was killed in a skirmish near Yobaster towards }t Killed in  the middle of Safar of the year 275 (July, a. p. 888), after a reign of two years Onur Tb  all but fifteen days. He was then forty-six years old, having been born in 229  (beginning Sept. 29, a. p. 843). His mother’s name was Athl.   Al-mundhir was a wise and enlightened sovereign: it was a common saying in  his time,—‘‘ Al-mundhir has rendered Andalus a country of abundance and peace.”  Such were his ardour and abilities in the field, that he came off victorious in almost  every encounter. The people of Toledo having sent him the customary tribute  at the commencement of his reign, he returned it, saying, ‘‘ You may keep it for the  expenses of the war, for I shall soon be upon you, if God be pleased.”   Al-mundhir was succeeded by his brother, “Abdullah Ibn Mohammed. According Snetecded by  to Ibnu Khaldiin, the revenue of Andalus, before the time of Abdullah, amounted ‘Abdullah.  to three hundred thousand dinars; one-third of which went to pay the army, one  hundred thousand to the salaries of governors and public officers, the remainder  to the coffers of the Khalif. During the reign of ’Abdullah the above sum was  considerably increased, and the overplus was spent by him in the civil wars  and rebellions with which his reign was troubled, as he had to contend with  enemies *” in every corner of his empire.   Abdullah was a very pious man; he regularly attended the mosque, and never  made use of wine or other intoxicating liquors: he was eloquent and witty. Ibnu  Hayy4n has preserved us several of his verses composed extempore ; among which  are the following.   It was the custom of ’Abdullah’s Wizirs, whenever they were consulted upon the  affairs of the state, to present to him their written answer in a wooden case.** One  of his Wizirs, named An-nadhr“*? Ibn Salamah, having once been consulted upon  certain business, sent up his written opinion in the manner above described.

On his assuming the command, ’Abdu-r-rahmdn found the country  disturbed by numerous rebels, and distracted by the civil wars and private feuds of  its powerful lords. He, however, succeeded in extinguishing the fire of discord,  putting down rebellion, and subjecting the whole of Andalus to his authority. He  had reigned five-and-twenty years when this was accomplished, and yet he reigned  [afterwards] twenty-five years more, during which time the empire of the Beni  Umeyyah in Andalus reached the highest degree of power and splendour. He was  the first sovereign of his family who assumed the titles of Khalif and Amfru-l-  miumentn (commander of the faithful), and who surrounded his court with a  magnificence and splendour which equalled, if it did not exceed, all the pomp and  state displayed by the powerful sovereigns of the house of ""Abbas. ’Abdu-r-rahman  waged incessant war with the Christians: at first, he himself led his armies to the  field, but having in the year 323 (beginning Dec. 10, a.p. 934) lost the battle  of Al-handik, on which occasion God was pleased to afflict the Moslems with a  most severe defeat, he abstained thenceforward from commanding his armies in  person, although he invariably sent his troops every season ® to invade the Christian  territory.

The Christian nations beyond the Pyrenees extended to him the hand of submission,  and their kings sent him valuable presents, to conciliate his favour. Even the  Kings of Rome, Constantinople, and other distant parts, sent him ambassadors  asking for peace and suspension of hostilities, and offering to subscribe to any  conditions that he should dictate. The Kings of Galicia, Kashtdlah (Castile),  Pamplona, and other northern nations bordering on ’Abdu-r-rahmén’s territory,  repaired to his court,‘ kissed his hand in token of obedience, and solicited his  friendship and good-will.   According to Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi [Abi ""Amru Ahmed] the accession of ’Abdu-r-  rahmén took place at the beginning of Rabi’-l-awal of the year 300 (Oct. or Nov.  A.D. 912); for in a work which that author wrote, entitled Al-’ikd (the necklace),  he commemorates the above event in the following verses :   ‘* A new moon has begun; and the empire has received fresh strength and  “ vigour.   ‘*O thou [who rulest] by the grace of God, tell me, if I am deficient  “ fin praise], who can pretend to surpass thee?   “For if the month of fasting (Ramadhan) be followed by its fitr, this day  “ is like a festival to the whole age.” ®   By the first of the above verses the poet means that ’Abdu-r-rahmaén ascended  the throne at the beginning of the moon of Rabi’-l-awal.   ’Abdu-r-rahmén assumed the surname of An-ndsir lidin-illah (the defender of the  religion of God), by which he is generally mentioned by the historians of his age.   One of the first acts of his administration was to ameliorate the condition of  his subjects by suppressing many illegal taxes which had been imposed under the  preceding reign. The fact is recorded by Ibnu Khaldin, who tells us that no  sooner had ’Abdu-r-rahmdn ascended the throne, than he abolished all taxes  contrary to the spirit of the Sunnah or body of traditional law, and by causing  justice to be equally and fairly administered, by encouraging agriculture and trade,  laid the foundations of national prosperity.   ’Abdu-r-rahmén was indefatigable in his exertions to humble the pride of the  Christians, whom he defeated and slaughtered on several occasions. In the year  308 (beginning May 22, a.p. 920), for instance, he invaded Galicia at the head of  a considerable army, and ravaged that country. The King Ordhin Ibn Adefiinsh  (Ordofio II., son of Alfonso), assisted by the King of the Franks and the King  of the Basques,® advanced to defend his dominions, but in vain: ’Abdu-r-rahmén  defeated them both, wasted their territories, reduced their strongholds, and demo-  lished several of their fortresses.",172,book_6,
"    cHap. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 135    Again, in the year 312 (beginning April 8, a.p. 924), he invaded the land of Invasion of  Banbilinah (Navarre), penetrated far into the theatre of war, wasted the country; Nevare.  took and razed many fortresses, set fire to the towns, and put the inhabitants to  the sword; and although the enemy fled to the mountains, and occupied the passes  with a view to attack him on his retreat, they were unable to make the least  impression upon him.   After this, ’Abdu-r-rahman had to contend with some of his own subjects,” who  had revolted against him and sought the assistance of the Christians. After  defeating the rebels in several encounters, An-ndsir turned his victorious arms  against the people of Alava, who had favoured the revolt, and took thirty of their  fortresses.   In the year 322 (Dec. 21, a.p. 933), An-ndsir made an incursion into the  mountainous districts [of Navarre], whence he marched on Pamplona. Queen  Tiitah (Theuda ?),® dreading his vengeance, came out to meet him, and put herself  under his power ; upon which An-ndsir invested her son Garcia with the sovereignty  of the land. This being done, An-ndsir turned towards Alava, and, scouring the  plains, subdued and razed its fortresses.   Some time after this,9 ’Abdu-r-rahmdn invaded Galicia, where Ordhin Ibn  Adefiinsh (Ordofio ITI.) reigned at the time. Not daring to meet him in the field,  the Christian king shut himself up within the walls of Oshmah (Osma) ; but  An-ndsir besieged him in that fortress, took and demolished Burghosh (Burgos) and  several other strong places, and defeated the Christian forces in many encounters ;  after which he returned victorious to Cordova.   In the year 325 (beginning Nov. 18, a.p. 936), hearing that Tutah (Theuda), Thewla Queen  Queen of Banbilinah (Pamplona), had infringed the treaty which subsisted between  the two, An-ndsir invaded her kingdom, subdued the greater part of it, and com-  pelled her to ask for peace ; after which he returned triumphant to Cordova.   In the year 327 (beginning Oct. 28, a.p. 938), ’Abdu-r-rahmdn undertook an Bettie of  expedition against the Galicians, which ended in the disastrous battle of Al-handik,  in which the Moslems were defeated, numbers of them falling under the swords  of their enemies. Since the reign of his grandfather ’Abdullah,’® the Christians  of Galicia had held possession of the city of Samirah (Zamora), on the northern  side of the river Diroh (Duero), which they had fortified with the utmost care,  and in which they had placed a numerous and well-appointed garrison. From  this place the Christians were making continual incursions into the Moslem terri-  tory, leading the defenceless inhabitants of the opposite banks into captivity, and  committing all manner of excesses and depredations. There was still another  cause for the expedition. A rebellious chieftain, named Umeyyah Ibn Is‘hék,    Of Alava.",173,book_6,
"    Defeat of the  Moslems,    136 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vi.    had taken refuge at the court of the Christian king; and being a shrewd and  intelligent man, well versed in military affairs, he gave the enemy the best advice,  and often conducted their armies into the very heart of the Moslem territory.  This Umeyyah was the brother of Ahmed Ibn Ishak, one of ’Abdu-r-rahman’s  Wizirs, whom that Sult4n caused to be put to death for some civil offence of  which he had been guilty. At the time of his brother’s execution, Umeyyah was  governor of a frontier fortress called Shantareyn (Santarem). No sooner did  he receive intelligence of his brother’s fate, than he fled with a handful of followers  to the court of Ramiro, King of the Galicians, whose service he entered, guiding  his armies to the defenceless points of the Mohammedan frontier, or to the pesses  and fords at which he could best assail the territories of Isl4m. However, whilst  Umeyyah, who had all the time retained possession of Santarem, was one day  enjoying the amusements of the chase, one of his own slaves, who had remained  in charge of the fortress, rose and took command of the place, shut the gates  against Umeyyah, and sent a messenger to ’Abdu-r-rahman, apprising him of  what had occurred. Umeyyah, in the mean while, fled to the court of his ally,  the King of Galicia, who received him with the greatest kindness, and appointed  him his Wizir. This was the motive of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn’s expedition.   As the historian Al-mes’tidi has preserved us an account of this war, we shall  here abridge his narrative. ‘ ’Abdu-r-rahmdn,” says he, “‘ having led his army  ‘‘ against Zamora, the capital of Galicia, which he besieged, Radmir (Ramiro II.),  ‘ King of the Galicians, hastened to its relief, and encamped in the neighbourhood.  ‘‘?Abdu-r-rahmén’s forces amounted to one hundred thousand men; other authors  ‘‘ make their number still more considerable. A contest soon ensued between  “the two armies, in which the Moslems came off victorious, this being in the  ‘month of Shawwél, 327 (July or August, a. p. 939), three days after the eclipse  “of the sun which happened in the same month.’? The garrison of Zamora,  *“‘ having made a sally, were repulsed by the besiegers, who pursued them sword  ‘in hand beyond the moat within the walls of the city. But, as the Moslems  ‘“‘ were preparing to follow up the advantage, the Christians fell suddenly upon  ‘ them, and killed fifty thousand of their number.”   The same writer says, in another part of his work, ‘‘The city of Zamora was  ‘enclosed by seven walls of wonderful structure, the work of one of the early  “kings (of Galicia]. The space between the walls was occupied by ditches '* and  “wide moats filled with water. The Moslems succeeded in forcing their way  “ through the first two enclosures, but when they came to the third, they were  ‘* furiously assailed on all sides by the Christians, who put to death every Moslem  “ they could overtake. Upwards of forty thousand men, others say fifty thousand,",174,book_6,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 137    ‘were drowned in the moats. This was doubtless one of the most signal defeats  ‘* ever inflicted upon our brethren of Andalus, either by the Galicians or by the  ‘* Basques ; and the victory would have been still more complete, had King Ramiro  ‘ pursued the remnant of ’Abdu-r-rahmén’s army, which, panic-struck as it was,  “‘ he would have had no difficulty in annihilating. But by alarming Ramiro with  ‘* the fear of an ambush, and alluring him with the rich spoil left by the Moslems  ‘in their camp, Umeyyah Ibn Is’hak prevented him from following up the victory.  ‘* Some time after, Umeyyah applied to ’Abdu-r-rahmén for a safe conduct, and,  “ having obtained it, fled the court of Ramiro, and arrived ‘at Cordova, where he  “* was graciously received by the Khalif.” '   “ Burning to revenge this disaster, An-nésir continued to send yearly expe- ATPe by ""Ab.  ‘* ditions under the command of his generals, who invariably came off victorious, @4-t-rahm4n.  ‘* gaining many battles, in which the Galicians lost twice as many men as those  “« who had fallen on the side of the Moslems at the battle of Al-handik. In short,   “at the moment we write (a. H. 330) the Moslems have regained their superiority  ‘“‘ over Ramiro, the King of the Galicians.”   Thus far Al-mes’idi. Other writers have preserved details of this battle, the  year in which it was fought being well known among the people of Andalus as  ’A'mu-l-handik (the year [of the battle] of Al-handik). We have already said, that  ever after this defeat An-nasir abstained from leading his armies in person, but that  he persevered in the laudable purpose of waging war with the infidels, by directing  the governors of the districts on the frontiers of his empire to make incursions into  the Christian territory.   On the death of Garcia, son of Sancho, King of the Basques, his mother Tiitah  (Theuda) succeeded him as regent and guardian of his son. Having shortly after  infringed the treaty subsisting between her and the Khalif, it was decided to chastise  her for her bad faith. Accordingly, in the year 325 (beginning Nov. 18, a. p. 936)   An-nasir invaded her dominions, wasted all the territory round Pamplona, and  compelled the faithless queen to implore peace.

Accordingly, in the year 336  (beginning July 22, a. p. 947) an embassy arrived in Cordova with presents from  Constantine, the Emperor of Constantinople. The day in which the ambassadors  made their entrance into the capital was a day of festival, and great crowds of  people collected by order of ’Abdu-r-rahmadn to meet them.   Ibnu Khaldtin says that the Khalif’s troops received new arms for the occasion,  and were completely equipped; the royal apartments were decorated with the   VOL. II. T",175,book_6,

The Wizirs, and the officers attending on the royal person,  were all drawn out, keeping their proper places in the utmost order. The ambas-  sadors were then introduced to the presence of the Khalif, and were struck with  astonishment at the splendour and magnificence displayed before them. They  approached the throne, and delivered their credentials into the hands of the Khalif,  who commanded the learned of his court to address the assembly in speeches in  which they should commemorate the superiority of Islam [over every other religion]  and the power of the Khalifate, and return thanks to God for the mercies he had  dispensed [to the true believers], through the manifestation and support of the true  religion, and the humiliation and discomfiture of its enemies. But when the  learned men who were present prepared to execute his commands, all failed in their  attempt ; and they were so overpowered by dread of the august assembly, that they  fixed their eyes on the ground, and kept silence. If any speaker rose to address  the assembly, he stammered, and was soon reduced to silence by the terror that this  most imposing scene produced in his mind. Seeing this, An-ndsir intrusted the task  to Abi ’Ali Al-kali, a learned man lately come from ’Irdk,"" and one of the literary  characters attached to the suite of his son Al-hakem, the heir-apparent to the  throne. Knowing his high literary reputation, An-ndsir chose him in preference  to any other; but he likewise failed, through want of the necessary resolution.  Then rose Mundhir Ibn Sa’id, a native of Fahsu-l-balitt, who, though not ac-  customed to speak extempore, and not in the least prepared for the occasion, made  a most able speech, wherein he developed and explained admirably the subject  given to him, and delivered extempore on the same subject a long poem, with  which the assembly was extremely delighted: the astonishment he produced by  such an extraordinary performance was so great, that a murmur of approbation  ran through the assembly, notwithstanding the solemnity of the occasion; and  An-ndsir appointed him on the spot to the office of Kddt-l-jam’dh (chief justice),  in which he greatly distinguished himself by his profound knowledge and eloquence.  As the harangue which Mundhir delivered on this solemn occasion is given at large  by Ibnu Hayy4n and other historians, we need not quote it here.   On the departure of the Greek ambassadors, Hisham fbn Hudheyl accompanied  them, with a magnificent present, and with instructions to conclude an alliance, and  strengthen the friendship between the two monarchs. At the expiration of two  years Hisham returned to Cordova, having faithfully executed the commission  intrusted to him. Hishdm came attended by ambassadors from Constantine.",176,book_6,
"         CHAP, V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 139    After this arrived another embassy from a King of the Sclavonians, whose name an  was Dhiiku,'® as well as from the King of the Alaman (the Emperor of Germany),  and from a King of the Franks beyond the Jebdl Al-bort (Pyrenees), named Ukoh  (Hugo), besides a similar one from another King of the eastern confines of France,  called Kaldoh.""? These ambassadors were received by An-ndsir in great pomp and  state, and he ordered that the officers of his household and others should go out  to meet them. On the return home of the Sclavonian ambassadors, ’Abdu-r-  rabmaén sent along with them Rabi’, the Bishop,'® who reached the court of  Hoto (Otho), and returned after an absence of two years.   In the year 344 (beginning April 26, a.p. 955) Ordhtin (Ordofio II.) also sent   1 an embassy to ask for a continuation of the peace ; which was granted to him: and  in 345’ (beginning April 14, a. p. 956) he again sent to request that Ferdeland,  Count of Castile (Ferran Gonzalez), should also be comprised in the treaty ; to  which An-ndsir also consented.   | Garcia, son of Sancho,” had succeeded to the kingdom of Galicia after the death  of his father Sancho, son of Fruela; but the Galicians having risen against him,  under the command of the above Ferdeland, Count of Castile, this chief, who was  one of the greatest men in the country, declined that dignity in favour of Ordoio,  son of Ramiro” (Ordofio IV.), who was accordingly placed on the throne in his  stead. But as Garcia, son of Sancho, was the grandson™ of Theuda, Queen of  Navarre, this princess took his part, and presented herself to An-nésir in the year  347 (beginning March 24, a.p. 958), imploring the continuance of peace with herself  and her son Sancho, son of King Ramiro ;* and requesting at the same time that  he would assist her grandson Sancho, son of Garcia, to reconquer his kingdom,  and to take the field against his enemies. For this purpose, Theuda and the two  ' princes ™ repaired to the court of An-ndsir, by whom they were received in state ;  -and not only did the Khalif grant the queen and her son the peace which they  asked, but he also sent an army to replace Garcia™ on the throne of Galicia; which  was speedily accomplished, after depriving Ordojfio of it, and causing the Galicians  to swear allegiance to him. Seeing this, Theuda dispatched an embassy to thank  An-nésir, and likewise sent her letters to all the provinces [inhabited by the  Christians], acquainting the people with that event, and with the treacherous  conduct of Ferdeland, the Count of Castile. ‘The inhabitants believed her state-  ment, and reprobated the conduct of that chieftain; and An-ndsir, moreover,   ceased not to protect and assist him [Sancho] till he died.

"    Reception of  the Greek  ambassadors.    140 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooxK v1.    this another embassy arrived, sent by the King of Riimah (Rome), also soliciting  An-nasir’s friendship. The above narrative is borrowed from Ibnu Khaldiin, some-  what abridged: we shall now proceed to extract passages from other writers.   Ibnu Hayyan and others state that the empire of An-ndsir arrived at the  highest summit of glory and splendour; that the Greeks and Christians came to  him from all parts, courting his friendship, soliciting peace, and sending him  immense treasures. ‘‘ No nation,” continues Ibnu Hayyén, ‘‘ heard of him that  ‘* did not send him ambassadors. The Kings of the Greeks, those of the Franks,  “ and Majts (Northmen), all sent ambassadors to his court, who invariably returned  “* satisfied and contented. Among the embassies dispatched by infidel kings to  ‘**Abdu-r-rahman, the most celebrated was that of the ruler of Constantinah the  ‘* Great (Constantinople), who made him a most splendid present, and courted his  “ friendship.” We have already stated, on the authority of Ibnu Khaldin, that  the ambassadors of the Greek monarch arrived in the year 336 (beginning July 22,  A.D. 947); Ibnu Hayyén places their arrival in the month of Safar of the year  338 (August, 4. D. 949): which of the two dates is the right one, God only knows.  We shall here transcribe the passage of Ibnu Hayydn relating to the arrival and  reception of the Greek ambassadors in Cordova.   “No sooner,” says that diligent historian, ‘‘ was the Khalif An-ndsir informed  “ of the landing of the ambassadors sent by the Emperor of Greece at Bejénnah *  “ (Pechina), than he began to make preparations for their reception, intending  ‘to receive them with due honour and attention, and with the greatest possible  ‘* display. Accordingly he issued orders that Yahya Ibn Mohammed Ibn Leyth *  “‘ and other distinguished people of his court should immediately proceed to that  ‘* place (Pechina), and should wait upon the ambassadors, taking care that they  ‘* should be provided with every necessary for their journey to the capital. When  “they approached Cordova, several generals, followed by their respective bodies  “« of troops fully armed and equipped as in time of war, went out to meet them ; and  ‘‘ when they came still nearer, two of ’Abdu-r-rahmén’s chief eunuchs went out  “to them, with orders from their master to treat them with the utmost attention  “and respect, thereby intimating how much he desired to honour them; for the  “‘eunuchs of those days were amongst the highest functionaries at court, being  “ exclusively employed in the service of the Khalif or in that of his harem, and  ‘* being, moreover, intrusted with the custody of the royal palace. The ambassadors  “and their suite were lodged in a country-house called Munyah Nasr, which  “belonged to the Amir Al-hakem, the presumptive heir to the throne, and was  ‘situated in the suburb on the opposite (eastern) bank of the Guadalquivir.  “* Here no one, whether noble or plebeian, was allowed to visit them or hold any",178,book_6,

A guard of sixteen men was moreover stationed at the  ‘* gate of the palace, who relieved each other four by four, day and night. ’Abdu-r-  ‘‘ rahman then left the palace of Az-zahré, where he was living at the time, and  ‘removed to his palace in Cordova, previous to the reception of the Greek  ‘* ambassadors. Having appointed Saturday, the eleventh of the month of Rabi’-1-  ‘* awal of the above-mentioned year (338), and fixed upon the vaulted hall in his  ‘* palace of Az-zahra as the place where he would receive their credentials, orders  ‘* were issued to the high functionaries of the state_and to the commanders of the  “ forces to prepare for the forthcoming ceremony. [ The hall was beautifully deco-  ‘* rated for the occasion, and a throne glittering with gold and sparkling with gems,  ‘* was raised in the middle of it. To the right of the throne stood five of the  ‘* Khalif’s sons in the following order: next to him his eldest son Al-hakem, the  ‘* presumptive heir to the empire; next to Al-hakem, ’Abdullah ;* then ’Abdu-l-  “’aziz Al-asbagh ; and lastly, Merw4n. To the left of the Khalif stood his sons  * Al-mundhir, ’Abdu-l-jabbaér, and Suleyman ; ’Abdu-l-malek, being ill at the time,  ‘* was not present at the ceremony. Next to them were the Wizirs, each at his post  “to the right or left of the throne. Then came the Hajibs or chamberlains, the  ‘* sons of the Wizirs, the freed slaves of the Khalif, and the W4kils or officers of his  ‘household. The court of the palace had been previously strewn with the richest  “* carpets and most costly rugs; silk awnings of the most gorgeous description had  “ every where been thrown over the doors and arches. Presently the ambassadors  ‘‘ entered the hall, and were struck with astonishment and awe at sight of the  ‘* magnificence displayed before them, and the power of the Sult4n before whom  ‘“‘ they stood. They then advanced a few steps, and presented the letter of their  ‘¢ master, Constantine, son of Leo, Lord of Constantinah the Great (Constan-  “tinople). The letter was written in Greek upon sky-blue paper,*' and the  “ characters were of gold: within the letter was an enclosure, the ground of which  “* was also sky-blue, like the first-mentioned, but the characters were of silver ; it  ‘« was likewise written in Greek, and contained a list and description of the presents  ‘‘ which the Lord of Constantinah sent to the Khalif. Upon the letter was a seal  “* of gold, of the weight of four mithkdls, on one side of which was a likeness of the  ‘* Messiah, and, on the other, those of the King Constantine and his son. The letter  ‘“‘ was enclosed in a bag of silver cloth, over which was a case of gold with a  “* portrait of King Constantine admirably executed on stained glass.

For this purpose he instructed his son and heir  “ Al-hakem to select from among the poets of his court, accustomed to extempore  “ speaking, those who could best accomplish that difficult task.   ‘* Accordingly, Al-hakem commanded a dependent of his, named the Faquih  ‘Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr Al-kasinidni, to prepare for the occasion, and to  “compose an eloquent harangue to be pronounced before the Khalif on that  “day. Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr was perhaps the person best qualified for the task, being  ‘* a man of immense rhetorical learning and taste, and deeply learned in the Arabic  “ language; he therefore prepared to execute the commands of Al-hakem, and  ‘on the appointed day repaired to the hall of audience. Scarcely, however, had  ‘he begun to address the assembly, when the sight of the imposing ceremony,  “‘the dead silence kept by all present, the splendour and magnificence which  “‘ surrounded the throne of the Khalif, made such impression on him, that his  “voice faltered, his tongue clove to his mouth, and he could not articulate a  “single word, and fell senseless on the ground. The task of addressing the  “assembly was next intrusted to Abi ’Ali Isma’il Ibnu-l-kdsim Al-kéli Al-  ‘“‘ baghdddi, the author of the Amdli (dictations) and <An-nuwddir (novelties),  ‘then a guest of the Khalif, having lately arrived from ’Ir4k, who was reputed  “to be a prince in the science of rhetoric, and an ocean of language. ‘Get up,’  “ said one of the assembly to him, ‘ and raise the fallen man.’ Abi-l-kéli rose,  “and began addressing the assembly in a clear and intelligible voice: he thanked  ‘‘ and praised God as he deserves, invoked his blessing on the Prophet Mohammed,  “put, all of a sudden, he stopped for want of a word which did not occur to  ‘‘ him, and thus put an end to his peroration.”   Such is the account which Ibnu Hayyén gives of this occurrence. Ibnu Khaldin  says that it was Abi Ali who received in the first instance instructions to address  the assembly, and who went to the palace prepared with an harangue: this assertion  is corroborated by the author of the Mattmah [Ibn Khékén] ; but, as Ibnu Hayy4n  derived his information from men who were present at the ceremony, we hesitate  not to give the preference to his version. Be this as it may, it appears certain",180,book_6,

At the head of it was  Abdullah, one of the Khalif’s sons, who, from his ascetic habits and secluded life,  had received the epithet of Az-zahid [the austere]. Intelligence of his wicked designs  having been conveyed to his father in time, he ordered him into his presence, and  had him executed, together with the principal conspirators, on the day of ’Idu-]- Bxecution of  adhdhi (festival of the victims) of the year 339 (May 13, a.p. 951). It is said that dulab.  a celebrated theologian, named Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr,** had instigated this unfortunate  youth to the attempt on his father’s life, and that when that individual heard  that the conspiracy had been discovered, he destroyed himself. Others say that  Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr was innocent of the crime imputed to him; but God only knows:  the fact is, that he ended his days in prison on the same day in which ’Abdullah  was executed.   Andalus was not the only country where the arms of ’Abdu-r-rahmén were Conaests in  successful ; his armies subdued also a considerable portion of Africa, and established  in that country the rule of the Beni Umeyyah. The causes which led to that  glorious event are variously stated by the historians; but the appearance of the  Fatimites in that country, the inveterate hatred which the race of Umeyyah enter-  tained against them, and the mighty consideration of not allowing countries  bordering upon Andalus to fall into the hands of those conquerors, are given as  the real motives which induced the Khalif ’Abdu-r-rahmén to send his fleets and  armies to the assistance of the Beni Idris, the Beni Sdleh, and other princes  “attacked, and which led ultimately to the establishment of his rule over the greater  portion of Eastern and Western Africa.   In a. #. 305 (beginning June 23, a. p. 917), Abdullah, the Shiite, after reducing  the whole of Eastern Africa under his sway, sent his general Mossdélah Ibn  Habits Al-mekndsi against Yahya Ibn Idris, Sultan of Fez, whom he defeated,  and afterwards besieged in his capital. Although Mossdlah was then unable to  reduce Fez, he returned to Maghreb [Western Africa} in a.u. 309 (beginning",181,book_6,
"    144 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK v1.    May 11, a. p. 921), took that city, and put Yahya Ibn Idris to death. A relative  of the deceased, named Al-hasan, but who was better known under the surname  of Al-hojjam,** succeeded some time after in expelling from Fez the governor  appointed by Mossdlah, and seating himself on the throne of his ancestors. His  reign, however, was not of long duration: Musa Ibn Abi-l-’4fiyyah, who was  governor of Western Africa for the Fatimites, attacked him in 311 (April 20, a. pv.  923), took his capital from him, and put him to death. Again, in 34] (May 28,  A.D. 952), the dynasty of the Beni Idris regained possession of a great portion  of their former dominions, with the exception of Fez, which remained in the hands  of a general named Maystr the Shiite.   Subsequently to this, Abu-l-’aysh Ahmed, a prince of the family of Idris, seeing  his dominions invaded by the Fatimites, swore vassalage to An-ndsir, and sent  to implore his assistance. An-ndsir, however, would not send him any troops  unless the Idrisite gave him as hostages the ports of Tangiers and Ceuta. Abi-l-  ’aysh having refused to comply with his demand, An-ndsir dispatched a fleet, which  ravaged the coast, and compelled that sovereign to accept the terms offered to  him. Once master of those two important fortresses, An-ndsir extended his sway  over the surrounding country, until his power was firmly established in Western  Africa, and his rule was obeyed from Tihart to Sijilmésah. From every part  of that wide-spread region princes and lords came to the court of An-ndsir to  kiss his hand, in token of obedience and vassalage, and to implore his powerful  aid and protection. The princes of the Zendtah and other Berber tribes, the Beni  Idris, and other powerful families which held sway in Western Africa, hastened to  court his friendship, and offered to hold their respective dominions in his name.   “Tn the year 305 (beginning June 23, a.p. 917),” says the historian whose  words we transcribe, ‘‘ several members of the royal family of Sa’id Ibn Saleh,  “ King of Noktr, who had been put to death by the Shiites of Africa, took refuge  ‘in Malaga, Bejénnah, and other sea-ports in the south of Andalus. No sooner  “* was the Khalif ’Abdu-r-rahman informed of their arrival, than he sent them  ‘“‘ splendid robes and costly presents, and issued orders that they should every  ‘“‘ where be treated with the respect due to their rank, giving them their choice  “‘ between going to Cordova or any other part of his dominions, or remaining  ‘“ where they were. With the exception, however, of one or two who accepted  “the Khalif’s invitation, and visited him in his capital, the remainder preferred  “ fixing their residence in Malaga, owing to the proximity of that port to their  “« lost dominions, in which they hoped to be re-instated. ’Abdu-r-rahmdén promised  “to aid them against the Shiites of Africa whenever the opportunity should  “arrive. Accordingly, in the year 306 (beginning June 13, a.p. 918), an",182,book_6,
"    CHAP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 145    ‘* expedition was fitted out in Malaga, and after a short contest Saleh Ibn Sa’id  ‘was seated on the throne of his father. When the letters announcing this  ‘victory arrived at Cordova, ’Abdu-r-rahmdn caused them to be publicly read  ‘in all the mosques of Andalus; and he immediately sent re-inforcements,  ‘as well as provisions, military stores, and money, to maintain the new king  ‘in his conquest.” :   In the year 332 (beginning Sept. 3, a.p. 943), Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn  Abi ’Isa, the Idrisite, Kadi-l-jam’4h or supreme judge of Fez, arrived in Andalus  for the purpose of joining in the war against the infidels. We have already alluded,  in another part of this work, to the hospitable manner in which he was entertained  by the Khalif.* There came also to Cordova during this reign two other members  of the royal family of Idris, whose names were Hasan, son of Al-kdsim, better  known under the surname of Janin (Kantin ?), and ""Isa Ibn Hantin Ibn Mohammed  Ibn Al-kdsim. They made their entry into Cordova on Monday the 12th of  Shawwé4l of the year 333°7 (May 27, a.p. 945). They were kindly received and  hospitably entertained by ’Abdu-r-rahmaén until the month of Safar of the ensuing  year (Sept. or Oct. a.p. 945), when both returned loaded with presents to their  native country.   “On Saturday the 9th of Rejeb of the year 341 (Nov. 28, a.p. 952),” says  the historian Ibnu Hayy4n, ‘‘ Hasan, son of Ahmed Al-fédhel, son of Ibréhim,  “son of Mohammed, and Mohammed, son of ’Isa, son of Ahmed, son of Ibréhim,  “* poth descendants of ’Ali Ibn Abi Télib, arrived in Cordova; and on Wednesday,  “the 26th of Rabi’-l-akhar of the ensuing year (Sept. 7, a.p. 953), ’Isa, Abi-l-  “’aysh,°® Yahya Ibn Hasan, and Hasan Ibn Mohammed, also belonging to the  “ royal family of Idris. They fixed their dwelling in Cordova, and left a numerous  “ posterity. Yahya died in 349 (beginning March 2, a.p. 960), and Hasan in  “ the following year: both were buried in the cemetery called Makbaru-r-rabadh  ‘(of the suburb) at Cordova; the chief Kadi of that capital, Mundhir Ibn  “* Sa’id Al-bolitti, reading the funeral service over their bodies, by the command  ‘of ’Abdu-r-rahmén. As to Abi-l-’aysh, it is well known that he met with his  “‘ death in an encounter with the Christians of the north.”   ’Abdu-r-rahmén died at Az-zahr4 on the second or third day of the month of Death of ’Ab-  Ramadhén® of the year 350 (October, a.p. 961), of a paralytic fit, at the age  of seventy-three. He was born in the year 277 (beginning April 24, a.p. 890),  and was only twenty years old when his father Mohammed was put to death.  His mother’s name was Moznah. In addition to the honourable appellation of  An-nésir lidin-illah (the defender of the true faith), ’Abdu-r-rahm4n received from  his subjects the surname of Abi-I-motref (the victorious).

"    Revenue of  Andalus under  his reign.    Buildings  erected by him.    146 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (BooK v1.    medan empire more prosperous, or the true religion more triumphant, than under  his reign. The infidels of Andalus were driven back to the mountainous districts  of the north, where they insured their safety only by paying tribute to the  Commander of the Faithful. Commerce and agriculture flourished ; the sciences  and arts received a new impulse, and the revenue was increased ten-fold. Not-  withstanding the costly magnificence with which ’Abdu-r-rahmdan surrounded his  person,—the unusual number of troops which he constantly kept in his pay,—the  multitude of eunuchs, Sclavonians, and other servants employed about his palace,—  the bounteous gifts which he distributed to the learned, and the splendid buildings  which he caused to be erected in various parts of his extensive dominions, in Africa  as well as in Andalus,—it is said, that when he died he left in the coffers of the  treasury the enormous sum of five millions of din4rs.   The amount of the revenue under this reign has been estimated by several  contemporary writers at six millions two hundred and forty-five thousand dinars ;  namely, five millions four hundred and eighty thousand arising from the land-tax  levied in the towns and districts, and seven hundred and sixty-five thousand being  the amount of indirect taxation, and duties imposed upon goods. As to the sums  which entered the royal coffers, being the fifth of the spoil taken from the infidels,  they were beyond calculation, and cannot be estimated, as no precise account of  them was kept in the treasury books.   Of this immense sum one-third went to pay the troops and the public officers ;  another third was destined for the Khalif’s own use, and the remainder was spent  in public buildings. Many, indeed, were the works of public utility which this  just and enlightened monarch caused to be erected in various parts of his extensive  dominions. As to his capital, Cordova, he is well known to have embellished  it and widened its precincts, so that it equalled, if it did not surpass, in size and  splendour the proud metropolis of the Beni ’Abbdés. His addition to the great  mosque of Cordova, and the construction of the palace of Az-zahré in the vicinity of  that capital, are two splendid erections, which will transmit the name of ’Abdu-r-  rahmén to posterity. Of both those buildings we have elsewhere given as accurate  a description as it was in our power; and therefore we need not now return to  the subject.   It is said that after the death of ’Abdu-r-rahman a paper was found in his  own hand-writing in which those days which he had spent in happiness and  without any cause of sorrow were carefully noted down, and on numbering them  they were found to amount only to fourteen. O man of understanding! wonder  and observe the small portion of real happiness the world affords, even in the  most enviable position! The Khalif An-ndsir, whose prosperity in mundane affairs",184,book_6,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 147    and whose widely-spread empire became proverbial, had only fourteen days of  undisturbed enjoyment during a reign of fifty years, seven months, and three  days. Praise be given to him, the Lord of eternal glory and everlasting empire!  There is no God but He! the Almighty, the giver of empire to whomsoever he  pleases !   As above stated, “Abdu-r-rahmdn was the first sovereign of the house of  Umeyyah in Andalus who assumed the title of Améru-l-miimenin (commander  of the faithful). The authors of the time say that when ’Abdu-r-rahmdn saw the  state of weakness and abjectness to which the Khalifate had been reduced, and  perceived that the Turkish freedmen in the service of the Beni “Abbas had usurped  all authority and power in the state,—when he heard that the Khalif Al-muktadir  had been put to death, in the year 317 (beginning Feb. 13, a.p. 929), by one  of his maulis, called Minis Al-modhaffer,** he no longer hesitated to assume the Atumes the |  insignia ‘of the Khalifate, and call himself Amfru-l-mimenin.   *Abdu-r-rahman has been described by the historians of the age as the mildest Characieriod  and most enlightened sovereign that ever ruled a country. His meekness, his min.  generosity, and his love of justice became proverbial: none of his ancestors ever  surpassed him in courage in the field, zeal for religion, and other virtues which  constitute an able and beloved monarch: he was fond of science, and the patron  of the learned, with whom he loved to converse, spending those hours which he stole  from, the arduous labours of the administration in literary meetings, to which all  the eminent poets and learned men of his court were admitted. The histories of  the time are filled with anecdotes, which show his love of justice, and his respect  for the learned; but we shall only transcribe the following as a proof of what  has been said of this good Khalif.   Wishing once to buy a house in Cordova for one of his concubines named ae  Hadhiyyah, whom he loved passionately, he fixed upon a very suitable residence  belonging to the children of Zakariyyé, the brother of Najdah. The house was  situated close to [the street of] the sawyers, in the eastern suburb, and separate  from every other building except a bagnio, with a very extensive reservoir of water,  which adjoined it on one side. It happened, however, that the children of Zaka-  riyya, the brother of Najdah, were at that time orphans under the tutorship of the  Kadi Mundhir. Having previously sent people to value the house, and the price  suiting him, An-ndsir dispatched a man to the executor of the father’s will, with  orders to treat in his own name, and purchase the house for him. Upon appli-  cation, the executor stated that he could not proceed further in the matter without  consulting the K4di himself as tutor of the children, without whose authority the  sale, he was well aware, could not be effected. Accordingly the Khalif sent to the",185,book_6,
"    148 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    Kédi Mundhir to treat about the purchase of the house, but Mundhir answered  thus to the messenger: ‘Tell the Commander of the Faithful, thy master and  ‘“‘ mine, that the property of an orphan cannot be sold except for three reasons ;  ‘* necessity, impending ruin, or the offer of more advantageous terms than those on  ‘which it was at first obtained. As to the first, my wards are not in want, and  ‘“‘ therefore they need not sell their property; neither is ruin to be apprehended  “at present, the house being in good condition, and wanting no repair; as to an  ‘ advantageous sale, that is the very thing I and my wards desire: and if the  “Commander of the Faithful chooses to give them such a sum.as may make  ‘their advantage quite manifest, I have no objection whatever to authorize the  ‘‘ executors to sell the property; if not, I shall never give my consent to the  ‘* transaction.” On the receipt of this answer, the Khalif immediately perceived  that the refusal to sell the house was merely intended to make him more anxious  for its acquisition, and he therefore desisted from any further negotiation. Mundhir,  on the other hand, feared lest the Khalif should take a resolution that might be  prejudicial to his wards: he ordered the executor to pull down the house, which  was done according to his instructions, and made him sell the ground and materials  to the agent of the Khalif, for a price higher even than the valuation made by the  officers of the Sultén. ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, however, having been informed of the  transaction, and how the house had been pulled down previous to the sale, sum-  moned the executor to his presence, and asked him whether the charge brought  against him was true, and what reasons he had for acting thus. The executor  acknowledged the fact; but gave as an excuse that he had been instructed to do so  by the K4di Mundhir. Upon this, ’Abdu-r-rahmdn sent for the Kadi, and, when    he was introduced to his presence, spoke to him thus: ‘‘Is it true that thou  “ orderedst the house of the brother of Najdah to be pulled down? ”—* I did,”  was Mundhir’s answer. ‘‘ And what was thy reason for doing so?” —‘“I was’    “ guided by those words of the Almighty, (may his name be exalted!) ‘ As to  ‘* the vessel, [it belonged] to certain poor men who did their business on the sea ;  ‘‘and I was minded to render it unserviceable, because there was a king behind  ‘them who took every sound ship by force.’”*! ’Abdu-r-rahman said nothing  further, and from that moment treated Mundhir, if possible, with greater deference  and respect than before.   Account of ‘This Mundhir Al-bohitti was the most learned theologian of his day. He was   bolatel. deeply versed in all branches of law and literature, and was besides renowned  for his probity and his justice. He was born, as before said, at a small town close  to Cordova, called Fahssu-l-bolitt (the field of the oak-trees), in the year 265  (beginning Sept. 2, a.p. 878). He filled the office of Kadi-l-jam’éh (supreme",186,book_6,
"    cHapP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 149    judge) of Andalus during the whole of An-ndsir’s reign, after whose death he was  confirmed in it by his son and successor Al-hakem. He died in 355 (beginning  Dec. 27, a.p. 965), and left many splendid works on the Sunnah, or body of  traditional law, on religious duties, and against the opinions of philosophers. He  was likewise an excellent poet; and the works of Al-fath,** Ibnu Sa’id, Ibnu  Hayy4n, and others, are filled with extracts from his poems.   Many other illustrious characters graced the court of An-ndsir, or flourished  under this reign, whose names only would fill a whole volume; as Ahmed Ibn  *Abdi-r-rabbihi, the author of the ""Ikd (necklaces) ; Khalaf Ibn ’Abbdés Az-zahréwi,  the celebrated physician ; ’Abdullah Ibn Ytinas Al-morédi; Abi Bekr Az-zubeydi ;  Mohammed Al-khoshani; Ibrahim Ibn Ahmed Ash-sheybdni:* but, brevity being  the chief object of our narrative, we shall pass them over in silence, keeping for  some other time the mention which they so justly deserve. We cannot, however,  refrain from mentioning here one of the most distinguished, namely, Késim Ibn rete Ton  Asbagh Ibn Mohammed Ibn Yuisuf Abii Mohammed; he was a native of Baena,  a town belonging to the jurisdiction of Cordova. One of his ancestors had been .  a freedman of the Khalif Al-walid, son of ’Abdu-l-malek. After taking lessons  at Cordova from Baki Ibn Mokhlid, Mohammed Ibn Wadhdhéh, Mutref Ibn Kays,  Asbagh Ibn Khalil, Ibn Meysarah, and others, Kasim departed for the East in  company with Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn Aymen,“ and with Mohammed  Ibn Zakariyy4 Ibn ’Abdi-l-’ala. This was in the year 274 (beginning May 27,  A.D. 887). In the course of his travels Késim visited Mekka, Kiifah, and Basrah,  where he attended the lectures of the most eminent professors and theologians  of the time, such as Al-mubarrad, Ibn Koteybah, and others. He afterwards  went to Cairwdn, and returned to Andalus, leaving behind him his two travelling  companions. Késim was deeply versed in the science of traditions, as well as in  history ; he shone above all in grammar, poetry, and law, being often consulted  upon difficult points. He made a collection of all the traditional stories contained  in the Sunan of Abi Datid. The cause of his writing that work was as follows:  “« Having arrived in ‘Irak with his friend Mohammed Ibn Aymen in the year 276  ‘* (beginning May 5, a.p. 889), they found that Abdi David, in search of whom  “« they had come, ‘had died shortly before their arrival in that country. Hearing  “ this, both friends conceived at the same time the idea of writing a work on the  “* Sunan, following the chapters of the book of Abi Déid, in which they might  ‘‘ introduce such traditional sayings of the Prophet and his companions as each  “of them had learned from his different masters. This idea being carried into  ‘execution, each produced an excellent work, which is well known now, and  “very much esteemed by students.” Subsequently to this, Kasim Ibn Asbagh",187,book_6,
"    150 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK v1.    published an abridgment of his own work, which he entitled Al-mujtani bi-s-sunan  (a selection from the Sunan). He began it in the month of Moharram, 324  (Dec. a. pv. 935), and dedicated it to the Amir Al-hakem, the son and successor  of An-nasir, whose preceptor he was. It is divided into four parts, and contains  two thousand four hundred and seventy traditional allegations.   Kasim Ibn Asbagh was born on Monday the twelfth day of the month of Dhi-1-  hajjah, 247 (Feb. a. p. 862).   Mis Hajib and Misa Ibn Mohammed Ibn Jodeyr was An-nésir’s H4jib: his Wizirs were  *Abdu-l-malek Ibn Jeh’war, ’Abdullah Ibn Ya’la, and Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek  Ibn Shoheyd. The latter made his sovereign a present so remarkable for the  invaluable articles, costly rarities, &c., of which it was composed, that it became  proverbial ; it being a common saying among the people of Andalus, when they  wished to extol the beauty and value of an object, Ahsan min hadyati-bn-Shoheyd  (handsomer even than the present of Ibn Shoheyd). As Ibnu Hayydn, Ibnu Khal-  din, and other historians have preserved a list of the articles, &c., composing this  present, we shall here transcribe their narrative, and will begin with Ibnu Khaldin,  who introduces it in his account of the Beni Umeyyah, as a proof of the great  power and unmatched splendour and riches of that dynasty when they ruled over  Andalus. That diligent historian has also noted the date of the day in which  the present was made, namely, on the twenty-second day of Jumada-l-awal of the  year 327 (March 16, a. pv. 939). Here follow his words :   Present made ‘* So_ magnificent was the present which Ibn Shoheyd made on this occasion to  “the Khalif An-ndsir that it became famous for its magnitude all over the Mo-  ‘‘ hammedan world ; and that even now the memory of it subsists among the people  ‘‘ of this country. No Sultdn of Andalus, it is generally agreed, ever received  ‘a similar one; and it is added, that An-nésir and his courtiers were so struck  “« by its magnificence, that they unanimously declared that such a trait of generosity  ‘ stood unparalleled in history. Together with the present, Ibn Shoheyd sent an  ‘« elegant epistle or dedication, in which he expressed his gratitude for the honours  “ conferred on him by An-ndsir, and thanked that Khalif for his favours. The  “ epistle itself was a model of eloquence, and people eagerly transcribed it or  “* procured copies of it. An-ndsir was so much pleased both with the letter and  “the present, that he exalted Ibn Shoheyd in honour and dignity over his: fellow  “‘ Wizirs, and doubled his salary, which he raised to forty thousand dinars of  “« Andalus, besides one hundred thousand dinars as a gratuity in the great festivals  ‘of the year.   ‘He also doubled his functions as well as his salary, for which reason he was  “* called Dhi-l-wizdrateyn (the holder of the double Wizirate) ; Ibn Shoheyd being",188,book_6,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 151    ‘‘ the first functionary of Andalus on whom that title was conferred, in imitation,  ‘‘no doubt, of Sa’id Ibn Mokhlid, Wizir of the Beni ’Abbés at Baghdad, [who  “* was so called]. To all these honours An-nésir added another distinction, namely,  “‘ that his seat in the council-room should be raised higher than those of the  ‘‘ other Wizirs, and that his name should be the first in the list of the government  “* pensioners: in short, his authority and influence at court became immense. The  “* following is the list of the articles, &c., of which the present was composed :   “Five hundred thousand mithk4ls of coined gold ;** four hundred pounds of  “ virgin gold, worth, in exchange, forty-five thousand dinars ; and silver bullion to  “‘ the amount of two hundred bidr.“© (Ibnu-l-faradhi mentions only five hundred  thousand dinérs.)   “‘ Twelve pounds of Indian aloes, capable of bearing an impression like wax ; one  “‘ hundred and eighty pounds of aloe-wood, of the best quality ;7 and one hundred  ‘‘of another sort, resembling the muntaki.”*® (However, Ibnu-l-faradhi, who  refers to the letter, and to the list of the articles, &c., sent by Ibn Shoheyd, says  four hundred pounds of the best aloe,*® in which there was a piece weighing  one hundred and twenty pounds.)   “* One hundred ounces of pure musk,® of the best quality.” (Ibnu-l-faradhi,  quoting the above document, says two hundred and twelve.)   “ Five hundred ounces of pale amber, of the species which preserves its quality  ‘‘ without previous preparation. Of this, one piece was to be seen of wonderful  ‘‘ dimensions, perfect in shape, and weighing one hundred ounces.” (Ibnu-l-  faradhi says one hundred ounces in all, and one piece of the weight of forty  ounces.)   ‘Three hundred ounces of the purest camphor, of the best quality; thirty  “ pieces of silk cloth, of various colours and patterns, printed and embroidered  ‘‘ with gold, and suitable only for the Khalif’s dress; ten pelisses, lined with  “the most costly martens’*! fur, from Khorassdn.”   Ibnu-l-faradhi’s account differs materially from this. He says, ‘‘ Of robes of  “‘ various colours, intended for the Khalif’s own use, partly white, and partly of  “* other colours, thirty ; five cloaks or outer garments, of the same kind and shape as  “* those used by the Faquirs of the Sha’ybi sect,°? and destined also for the Khalif’s  “own use; ten pelisses of the best martens’ fur, seven of which were white, and  ‘© came from Khorassdn, and the remainder of various colours [came from other  “‘ countries]; six square “Irdkian dresses, also fit for the Khalif; forty-eight  “« milhdf (cloaks) 5° worked in flowers, for daily use; and one hundred more, of  “the same manufacture, to sleep in at night.”   The reader must have observed that with the exception of the thirty pieces of",189,book_6,
"    152 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN {Book v1.    silk cloth, not one of the above articles of dress is mentioned by Ibnu Khaldin ;  but we do not hesitate to adopt the account of Ibnu-l-faradhi, which, from the  fact of that author having derived his information from the list -itself as well as  from the keeper of the presents, is unquestionably entitled to more credit.   ‘‘Ten heavy chests containing one hundred sable skins.” (In this statement  both authors agree.)   “ Six ’Irékian tents, and forty-eight horse-cloths made of silk worked with  ‘“‘ gold, manufactured at Baghd4d; four thousand pounds weight of spun silk ;  “and one thousand more of raw silk, of various colours, for spinning ; thirty pieces  “ of the stuff called kaziun** for saddles.” (Ibnu-l-faradhi agrees with the above  account; but he observes that the manufactured silk did not make part of the  present, but went directly into the hands of the Sdhibu-t-tirdsz, or master of the  royal robes, who received it from Ibn Shoheyd, and entered it in the books of  the wardrobe.)   ‘“‘ Thirty woollen carpets of different colours and patterns, each measuring twenty  “cubits in length; one hundred rugs, intended for kneeling on at prayer time,  “ of the finest texture and choicest patterns.” (Ibnu-l-faradhi adds, ‘ made in the  same way as the carpets.’)   ‘ Fifteen silk cushions of the stuff called nukha, having the face of it shorn.”  (This, Ibnu-l-faradhi observes, was also a stuff for carpets of the finest quality,  and such as was only used by very rich people.)   ‘Of arms and weapons there were, eight hundred suits of armour for horses,  ‘to adorn them in processions and public exhibitions.” (Ibnu-l-faradhi says only  one hundred; but he adds that they were of the most extraordinary workman-  ship, and highly finished.)   “* One thousand shields manufactured at Sult4niyyah; one hundred thousand  ‘* arrows of the best kind.   ‘* Fifteen select Arabian steeds of the choicest qualities, and destined for the  “ Khalif’s own riding.” (Ibnu-l-faradhi says one hundred more, fit for military  incursions, and trained for war.) ‘‘ Twenty mules for the Khalif’s own riding,  “* fully caparisoned and bridled, and having the seats of the saddles covered with  “a species of ‘Irdkian velvet, called ghaffdrt.” (Ibnu-l-faradhi says one hundred  steeds, namely, fifteen barbs for the Khalif’s own riding; five more of the same  class, but chosen among the rest for their superior qualities, most splendidly  harnessed and bridled, and having the seats of the saddles covered with ’Irékian  velvet, also for the Khalif’s own riding; the remaining eighty were suitable for  servants and attendants. Besides the mules above mentioned, Ibnu-l-faradhi  counts five ambling mules remarkable for their swiftness and easy pace.)",190,book_6,

The latter were provided, besides, with  ‘all their jewels, ornaments, and musical instruments.” (In this both authors  agree.)   “Ten kintars (hundred weights) of lump sugar, of dazzling whiteness, and  ‘‘ without a speck in it.”   ‘« And lastly,” says Ibnu Khaldiin, “ he presented his sovereign with a valuable  ‘« villa, and the lands attached to it, in the sowing of which many thousands of  “‘ mudd of grain had been expended by the giver. The stone only for the several  “* buildings erected on the estate had cost eighty thousand dindrs in one year.  “« There were besides twenty thousand trees of the finest and most durable wood,  “‘ very straight, and in the best condition, the actual value of which was fifty  “‘ thousand dinars.”   So far Ibnu Khaldiin ; but Ibnu-l-faradhi, who, as we have stated elsewhere, saw  and transcribed the epistle which Ibn Shoheyd sent along with the present, has  preserved some details which we think worthy of insertion in our present narrative.  He says, after mentioning the male and female slaves,—‘‘ For a long time before,  “Ibn Shoheyd, who accompanied or commanded almost every expedition sent  “* against the Christians, had destined a certain portion of his share in the spoil to  ‘‘ purchase handsome captives of both sexes, as he himself informs us in his epistle,  ‘‘ where he says that he bought them with the produce of victory, and through the  “* favour dispensed to him by the Amir.”   The epistle ended thus, according to Ibnu-l-faradhi: ‘‘ And when I heard that my  “illustrious master (may God grant him his help!) had deigned to cast his eye  “‘ over the estate in the Kanbaniyyah,’” I immediately directed the Sultan’s agent,  “‘Tbn Bakiyyah, to purchase it from the owner; and I did not rest until I heard  “ that he had completely succeeded, and that the deeds were already drawn in the  “ Khalif’s name. The same thing was done with respect to another estate in the  “ vicinity of Jaen, called Sheyrah.°® When I heard that it had been described to  “the Khalif, who was pleased to inquire about it, I never ceased importuning  “the owner of it until he sold it to me, with all its buildings, plantations, fields,  “‘ woods, and waters; the whole being duly transferred to Ibn Bakiyyah, who,  “T hope, will reap the next harvest thousands of mudd of every kind of grain.  ‘When, moreover, I ascertained that it was the Khalif’s wish to build upon the  “latter estate, I immediately gave all my attention to forestall his wishes, and  “thought of the many spots which his gracious majesty had been pleased to visit,  “‘in order to perpetuate his memory in their buildings.

His  ancestor Shoheyd had been present at the conquest of that country by Térik Ibn  Zeyéd. His father ’Abdu-l-malek had served in the armies of ’Abdullah, and  gained great reputation by his courage and his talents; and by him Ahmed was  early trained to arms, and acquired that superiority in military affairs which made  him the scourge of the infidels and the idol of the Moslems. He was so successful  in his expeditions against the Galicians and Franks, that he amassed considerable  riches, and was enabled to present the Khalif An-ndsir with a gift such as no  subject ever before presented to his master.   Ibn Bessdm relates of him, that he had once a Christian page so exquisitely  handsome that no human eyes ever saw the like of him before. This page he once  introduced to An-ndsir, who no sooner cast his eyes on him than he said to Ibn  Shoheyd, ‘‘ Where and how didst thou acquire such an inestimable jewel?” ‘It  came to me,” answered Ibn Shoheyd, ‘‘ by the blessing of God.” ‘‘ By the Lord!”  replied An-ndsir, ‘‘ were any one to make me a present of the stars, or let me  choose between the moon and this page, I should not hesitate for an instant :”  upon which, Ibn Shoheyd, having prepared a suitable present, sent it to ’Abdu-r-  rahmén along with his page, to whom he said on parting, ‘‘Go, my son; thou  “ must form part of the present I destine for the Commander of the Faithful.  “« Were it not for the love I bear him, I would sooner have parted with my soul  ‘* than with thee.”   The same author [Ibn Bessdm] relates another curious anecdote respecting  An-nésir, which he pretends to have received from a man who held it from another,  who had it from the Khalif’s own lips.

Having then inquired who had taught the starling, and dis-  patched him on such an errand, he was informed that the bird belonged to his wife  Marjanah, the mother of Al-hakem Al-mustanser-billah, the presumptive heir to the  throne, who, having previously trained the bird to repeat the verses, had sent him  on at the time when An-ndsir was going to be bled; upon which the Khalif made  Marjanah a present of upwards of thirty thousand dinars.

On the day after the death of ’Abdu-r-rahman, his son Al-hakem, surnamed Abi-l-  *4ssin and Al-mustanser-billah (he who implores the help of God), ascended the  throne. It was on a Thursday.' Immediately after his accession, Al-hakem sur-  rounded his person with all the pomp and magnificence of the empire, and sent  down his letters to the provinces, apprising the people of his elevation, and calling  upon them to swear allegiance to him. On the same day he began to give his  attention to the regulation of his empire and the strengthening of his power, to  the inspection of the royal palaces, and the review and equipment of the troops.  The Sclavonians of the palace were the first to take the oath of allegiance to  him: first came the eunuchs of the palace, as Ja’far, the master of the horse and  of the royal robes, and other superior officers generally employed in the household  of the greatest Khalifs, who were ordered to proceed immediately to swear in all the  Sclavonians under their orders; then followed the remaining officers of the royal  household, who were inferior in rank to the above-mentioned, whether katibs,  servants, mukaddams (captains), or ’arffs (officers), all of whom tendered their  respective oaths. .   The people of the palace having been all sworn in, Al-hakem commanded his  chief Wizir, Ja’far Ibn ’Othman, to proceed immediately to the residence of his  own brother, Abi Merw4n ’Obeydullah,? who kept aloof [from the ceremony],  and bring him, without accepting of any excuse, to his presence, for the purpose  of exacting from him the customary oath of allegiance.

All the brothers of  Al-hakem, who were then eight in number, arrived at the palace at night, and were  lodged [according to their rank] in the two wings of the palace. The ensuing  morning they took their station in the eastern and western halls, whilst the Khalif  sat on his throne under the central gilded pavilion, one of those in the southern  part of the palace opening upon the marble terrace. The ceremony having  commenced, the royal brothers came first: they approached the throne, and  inaugurated Al-hakem, reading the formula of inauguration, and taking the cus-  tomary oath, with all its sanctions and restrictions. Then came the turn of the  Wizirs, and of the sons of the Wizirs, and of their brothers, who were quickly  followed by the Shortah or body-guard, and by the servants of the palace. This  done, the brothers of the Khalif, the Wizirs, and the nobles, took their respective  seats to the right and left of the throne, with the single exception of ""Isa Ibn  Foteys, who stood in one corner of the hall, that he might swear in the people  as they entered. The neighbouring apartments were as usual filled with public  functionaries and courtiers who had a right to be present at such ceremonies.  In the hall where the Khalif sat, stood the great eunuchs of the palace, in  lines beginning at the right and left sides of the throne, and extending to the end  of the apartment, each man keeping his own place according to his rank or dignity.  They were all ‘dressed in white tunics, the inner garments‘ being of mourning ;  and they were armed with swords. Next to them were the servant eunuchs,  covered with mail, and having glittering swords in their hands; these were drawn  up in two lines over the terrace. On the adjoining parapets were the eunuchs of  the guard, with spears in their hands, and the Sclavonian eunuchs, dressed in white,  and armed with swords. These were followed by other Sclavonian eunuchs of  inferior rank ; and after these latter came the archers of the guard, with their bows  and quivers. Next to the Sclavonian eunuchs were the black slaves, splendidly  arrayed, and covered with glittering arms ; they wore white tunics, Sicilian helmets  on their heads, and held in their hands shields of various colours ; their weapons,  moreover, were ornamented with gold. They were drawn up in two lines [from  the terrace] to the last parapet. At the gate of As-suddah (Bdbu-s-suddah) were  the chief door-keepers, and outside of it the horse-guard of black slaves, ex-  tending in lines to the gate of the domes (Bdbu-l-akbd).

The ceremony being over, the Khalif granted the people  leave to retire, with the exception of his brothers, the Wizirs, and the officers of the  household, who were directed to stay at the palace of Az-zahra until the body of  An-ndsir should be carried to the palace of Cordova, there to be interred in the  cemetery of the Khialifs.   {pen Al-hakem made no alteration in the administration as left by his father An-nésir.   ; He confirmed every one of the Wizirs named by his father, and appointed for his  Hajib Ja’far Al-asklabi (the Sclavonian), who is said to have presented him on the  day of his nomination with sundry precious objects, a list of which is given by Ibnu  Hayyén in his Muktabis. The present consisted of one hundred Frank mamelukes,  mounted on swift horses, and armed and equipped for war with swords, spears,  shields, targets, and Indian caps; upwards of three hundred and twenty coats of  mail, of different kinds ; three hundred steel helmets ; fifty Indian helmets of wood ;  some European helmets not of wood, called At-teshtanah ; three hundred European  javelins ; one hundred shields of Sultd4niyyah ; ten suits of armour, of solid silver,  inlaid with gold; and twenty buffaloes’ horns, gilt.   This wars with « No sooner was the death of An-ndsir divulged,” says the historian Ibnu  Khaldiin, ‘‘ than the Galicians began to make attacks upon the Moslem frontiers.  “In order to check their progress, Al-hakem put himself at the head of his army,  “and invaded the dominions of Ferdeland Ibn Ghondisalb [Ferran Gonzalez],  “‘ besieged Shant Eshtiban (San Estevan de Gormé4z), which he took by force of  “ arms, and afterwards destroyed, returning victorious [to Cordova]; upon which  “ the Galicians desisted from their projects, and sought to make their peace with  ‘* the Moslems.”   After this, Al-hakem dispatched his mauli Ghélib to make war on the Galicians.  Having arrived at Medinah Sélim (Medinaceli), which was the focus of the war,  Ghalib was opposed by a considerable army of the Christians; but he fought with  them, putting them to flight, and causing them great loss. After which the  Moslems penetrated into the dominions of Ferdeland, which they overran and  wasted.   Sancho, the son of Ramiro, King of the Basques (Navarre), having broken the  treaties by which he was bound [to preserve peace], Al-hakem sent against him  At-tojibi [Yahya Ibn Mohammed],° the governor of Saragossa, with a large body of  troops. Seeing ‘this, the King of the Basques implored the help of his neighbour,  the King of the Galicians, who hastened to his assistance; but At-tojibi, having  met and defeated their united forces near Kiriah (Coria), ravaged the districts  round that city, and returned home victorious.",196,book_6,
"    CHAP.

He likewise sent Hudheyl Ibn Hisham and his mauli Ghalib into the  dominions of the Komes (Count) of Castile, which they ravaged.   Great indeed were the victories gained oyer the Christians during the reign of  Al-hakem, and repeated the incursions made by the generals of his frontiers into  the enemy’s territory. We may give as an example the conquest by Ghalib of the  town of Kalherah, in the country of Al-bashkans (Basques), which place Al-hakem  caused ta be peopled by Moslems, as well as the taking of Kottiébiah® by the  Ké4yid (governor) of Oshkah (Huesca); on which occasion the Moslems gained  considerable spoil in money, arms, provisions, and military stores, exclusive of the  sheep, cattle, and mares which they caught in the adjoining plains, of the grain and  fruits of all kinds which they reaped, and of the innumerable captives, of both sexes,  which they made,   In the year 354 (beginning Jan. 6, a.p. 965) Ghalib made an incursion into  Alabah (Alava), accompanied by Yahya Ibn Mohammed At-tojibi and Kasim Ibn  Motref Ibn Dhi-n-nitin. The three generals scoured the country, and rebuilt Hisn-  Ghorméj’ (San Estevan de Gormaz), which had been destroyed on a former occasion  by the Christians.   In the same year (a. H. 354) the ships of the Majis (Northmen) appeared on Ecatieal co  the coast of the ocean. Having landed close to Lisbon, they overran and ravaged Northmen.  the neighbouring country ; but the inhabitants, having risen to arms, fought with  them, and drove them to their ships. No sooner was the intelligence of their  disembarkation brought to Cordova, than Al-hakem in person repaired to the  districts invaded, and provided for the defence of the coast, ordering his Kdyidu-l-  bahr (admiral of the sea), named ’Abdu-r-rahman [Ibn] Romdhis,® to fit out the  fleet and attack them: but it was not necessary; for news soon arrived of their  having been defeated every where by the inhabitants of that coast, and their having  put to sea in great haste and confusion.   After this, happened the arrival in Cordova of Ordhiin Ibn Adefonsh (Ordofig IV.), Ordena IN.  King of the Galicians. As before related, An-ndsir had supported his cousin  Sancho, son of Ramiro, and assisted him in reconquering his kingdom, which  Ordofio had usurped, compelling the Christians to return under his sway; upon  which Ordofio had sought and obtained the assistance of his father-in-law Ferdeland  (Ferran Gonzalez), Count of Castile.

"    160 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book vi.    Sancho the same protection which his father An-ndsir had so graciously granted  to him, he resolved upon appearing at court, and placing himself under Al-hakem’s  protection. The Khalif received him with all the pomp and state before exhibited  on similar occasions, ordering his troops out on the day of his arrival, and com-  manding the officers of his household to go out to meet him some distance from the  capital, as may be read in the work of Ibnu Hayy4én, who has preserved an  account of this and the preceding arrivals, and of the interview which the Christian  king had with Al-hakem. That historian says, that the Khalif bade him sit down,  promised him his assistance against his enemies, put on him a khil’ah or dress of  honour, and wrote a deed with his own hand, by which he engaged to aid him  against his cousin Sancho, on condition that he should acknowledge himself the  vassal of Isl4m, and forsake the alliance of the Count of Castile. Ordofio swore to  fulfil the stipulated conditions by placing his right hand on the deed, and gave his  son Garcia as an hostage. He was then dismissed with presents and horses for  himself and followers, being escorted by the principal Christians who lived in  Cordova under the protection of the Khalif, that they might the better establish his  authority over his subjects, and reseat him on his throne. His son Garcia remained  in Cordova according to the stipulation. The following particulars are borrowed  from Ibnu Hayyén.   Towards the end of Safar of the year 351 (March, a.p. 962), the Khalif  Al-hakem sent out two of his maulis, named Mohammed and Zeyéd, sons of  Aflah An-ndsiri, with a portion of his guard, to meet Ghdlib An-nasiri, governor  of Medinah Sélim (Medinaceli), who was then escorting to Cordova King Ordhin  Ibn Adefonsh (Ordofio IV.) This Ordhiin, assisted by some small bands of  Galicians, who followed his banners, had been trying for some time to excite  dissension in the state, and had disputed the throne with a cousin of his, son of  his uncle, Sancho Ibn Radmir (Sancho the Fat), who had reigned before him.  Seeing that every attempt to seize on the throne had failed, the accursed Christian  bethought him of repairing to the court of Al-hakem, without either previously  asking his leave, or making any stipulation. The cause of that sudden resolution  was his having heard that Al-hakem was preparing an expedition to march that  very year against him ;® and not being in a condition to resist him, he decided  upon parrying, if possible, the blow aimed against him, and throwing himself upon  the mercy of the Khalif, hoping to be able to incline him to his favour.  Accordingly, although he had no safe conduct or security whatever from the  Khalif, he placed himself at the head of twenty of his followers, and crossed the  Mohammedan frontier.

No sooner was Al-hakem informed of their arrival than he sent forward the two Preparations   “sons of Aflah with an army to meet them. Having come up with Ordofio’s retinue, Khalif for his  the generals of the Khalif encamped for a whole day, after which they struck their reception.  tents and proceeded to Cordova. At their approach Al-hakem sent out Hishém  Al-mus‘hafi with a numerous army completely armed and equipped [as for war].  They advanced straight to the gate of Cordova, and passed close by the gate of the  palace. On his arrival at that piece of ground between the Bdbu-s-suddah and the  Bdbu-l-jendn (the gate of the gardens), Ordhin inquired of one of his escort  where the tomb of An-nasir lidin-illah (’Abdu-r-rahman III.) was; and this being  pointed out to him opposite the place where he stood within the raudhah or  cemetery attached to the royal palace, he immediately dismounted, took off his  cap,"" and having approached the spot pointed out to him, he went upon his knees  and prayed fervently for a length of time. After this he put on his cap, and  continued his march towards the dwelling assigned to him by the Khalif, which  was the palace called An-nd’urah (of the water-wheel). Preparatory to the reception  of his guest the Khalif had caused the palace to be strewn with every variety  of carpet and cushion, and provided with every description of furniture: his com-  mands were fulfilled in a manner that left nothing to wish for, the Christian king  and his suite being treated with the greatest attention and respect. In this manner  Ordofio spent the whole of Thursday and Friday. When Saturday came, Al-hakem  signified his wish to see the Christian, and accordingly every necessary preparation  was made for the forthcoming ceremony. The troops were fully equipped and  armed as in time of war; the Sclavonian guard was splendidly attired for the  occasion; the Ulemas, theologians, Kétibs, and poets were ordered to appear  in the audience-hall, whilst the Wizirs and other high functionaries of the state  received orders to be each at his post at the appointed hour.   When the day came, Al-hakem appeared seated on the royal throne in the eastern He is intro-  hall of his palace of Az-zahré, which opened into the terrace, having on each Segue  side his brothers, nephews, and other relatives, as well as the Wizirs, Kédis, civil  magistrates, and distinguished theologians, and other high functionaries, all sitting  in rows according to their rank or station. Among them was the supreme judge  of Andalus, Mundhir Ibn Sa’id Al-bolitti. Presently Ordofio made his appearance  in the hall, being introduced by Mohammed Ibnu-l-kdsim Ibn Tamis.!? The upper  part of his dress consisted of a tunic of white brocade, of Christian manufacture,   VOL. II. Y",199,book_6,

Ordofio came from his dwelling [in Cordova]  to the city of Az-zahra attended by a select party of the chief Christian residents  in Cordova, as Walid Ibn Khayrtn, who was the judge of the Christians in  Cordova, ’Obeydullah, son of Kasim Al-matrén (bishop)'® of Toledo, and others.  When close to the palace, Ordofo and his suite entered into a passage formed on  each side by bodies of infantry placed in such admirable order that the eyes  were dazzled at their uniformity, and so thickly set that the mind was bewildered  at their numbers. Such was, moreover, the brightness of their armour and  weapons, and the variety and richness of their uniforms, that the Christians were  actually stupified at what they saw, and repeatedly crossed themselves in utter  amazement at the imposing scene; they looked on with their heads down, their  eyelids contracted, and their eyes half-closed [through astonishment] until they  arrived at the outer gate of the palace of Az-zahrd, called Bdbu-l-akabd or ‘ the  gate of the domes,’ where all those who had gone out to meet Ordofio dismounted.  The Christian king and the counts of his suite continued on horseback until they  came to the interior gate called Bédbu-s-suddah, when all received orders to  dismount, and to proceed on foot, with the exception of Ordofio and Mohammed  Ibn Tamis, who passed mounted under the gateway. These two alighted at the  gate of the central southern pavilion’® in the building called Déru-l-jandal (the  house of the stones) upon a raised platform, the steps of which were covered with  silver cloth. In that very spot Ordofio’s rival and enemy, Sancho, the son of  Ramiro, had alighted when he came to visit Abdu-r-rahman An-ndsir lidin-illah.  Ordofio sat himself on the platform, and his suite sat before him [waiting for  Al-hakem’s pleasure]. Presently one of the Khalif’s officers made his appearance,  bringing the permission for Ordoiio to proceed; which he did on foot, followed  by his suite. In this way he advanced towards the terrace. Arrived in front  of the eastern hall, where Al-hakem was, Ordofio stopped, uncovered his head,  took off his bornis,7 and remained for some time in an attitude of astonishment  and respect, under the impression.that he was now approaching the radiant throne  of the Khalif. Being motioned to proceed, he moved on slowly between the two  lines [of soldiers] drawn up along the length of the terrace, which he traversed,  until he came to the door of the pavilion where Al-hakem sat. When he had  arrived before the throne, he threw himself on the floor, and remained for some  time in the most humble position ; he then stood up, advanced a few paces, again  prostrated himself, and repeated this ceremony several times, until he arrived at  a proper distance from the Khalif, when he stretched out his hand, and Al-hakem  gave him his. After this he went backwards, without turning away his face, to a",200,book_6,

Such among his counts and followers, moreover, as had been allowed to  enter the royal presence, advanced from behind him with repeated prostrations,  and approached the throne of the Khalif, who gave them his hand to kiss; after  which they all walked backwards, and placed themselves at each side of their king.  Among them came Walid Ibn Khayriin, who, as before stated, was the Kadi or  judge of the Christians living in Cordova, and who acted as interpreter for King  Ordofio on the occasion.   Al-hakem kept silence for a while in order to allow Ordofo time to sit down  and ‘compose himself; and when he perceived that the Christian had somewhat  recovered [from his fright] he broke silence and said, ‘‘ Welcome to our court,  “OQ Ordofio! may thy hopes be realized and thy wishes fulfilled! Thou wilt  ‘find in us the best advice and the most cordial reception, much beyond thy  “‘ expectations.” When these words were translated to Ordofo by his interpreter,  his countenance expanded and brightened up with joy; he came down from the  raised couch on which he sat, and humbly kissing the earth before the Khalif,  exclaimed, “I am the slave of the Commander of the Faithful, my lord and erect  ‘* master; and I am come to implore his favour, to witness his majesty, and to  “‘ place myself and my people under his protection. May he be pleased to grant  “me his powerful patronage, and consent to receive me into the number of his  “slaves! I hope that I come to him with a just demand and with a pure inten-  tion.” The Khalif answered, ‘‘We look upon thee as one most deserving of  “ our consideration and esteem, and we are ready to grant thee that preference  ‘and advantage over the people of thy sect which may render thee happy and  ‘content. Let us therefore hear the true cause that brought thee to our court,  “that we may place thee within the pale of our authority.” No sooner was  the Khalif’s answer made known to King Ordojio than he again prostrated himself,  and remained for some time deeply absorbed in prayer. He then proceeded to  state his case thus: ‘‘I need not remind thee, O Khalif, that my cousin Sancho,  “son of my uncle Ordofio, came once to this city to implore against me the  “help of thy glorious father and predecessor, the Khalif An-ndsir, who hesitated  “ not to grant him the assistance he sought, as the most powerful Kings and  ‘« greatest Khalifs are wont to do to all those who seek them and rely on them.  “ Yet the appearance of Sancho at this court was a compulsory act; his subjects  ‘« detested his rule, and so offensive was his behaviour towards them that they  “chose me for their king, although, God knows, I had not the least wish to  “‘ become such, and had taken no steps whatever to arrive at the throne.

It then pleased thy pre-  ** decessor (may God have mercy on him !) to restore Sancho to his lost kingdom,  “and to grant him his powerful aid, without paying regard either to the offers of  “ vassalage I made to him or the rich presents which from time to time I sent to  “him.

I am come confidently to place myself, my people, my  “* castles, and such among my subjects as obey my rule, under the command of  “the Khalif, that he may decide between us two in his great wisdom.” The  Khalif replied,—‘‘ We have listened to thy words and understood their meaning, and  “ certainly we will soon show thee greater favour, and our benefits shall come down  “on thee more profusely even than those of my father ever did on thy enemy.  ‘True, thy cousin Sancho came to our court first, and put himself under the  ‘ protection of this our empire; but that is no reason why we should neglect  “thee on his account. We will therefore diminish none of our favours, and thou  ‘ shalt return to thy country happy and content; we will collect together for thee  “ the scattered portions of thy kingdom ; we will make thee Lord of all the districts  ‘‘ which once acknowledged thy sway and are now in the hands of thy cousin;  “we will give thee our letters patent declaring our decision upon thy right [to  “ the throne] and that of thy cousin ; we will, in short, deprive him of his usurped  “dominions, and favour and protect thee greatly beyond thy most sanguine  ‘‘ expectations. We take God to witness of the truth of our words.” Again did  Ordofio prostrate himself before the Khalif, expatiating in praise of his kindness  and generosity. He then rose to retire, walking backwards so as not to turn  his face from the Khalif. Having thus arrived where the eunuchs were waiting  for him, Ordofio was conducted to the western hall opening upon the terrace, where  he plainly exhibited on his countenance the reverential awe with which he had  been struck, and his utter astonishment at the magnificence and splendour dis-  played before him, as indicative of the power and strength of the Khalifate. In  passing through the hall, the eyes of Ordofio fell on the vacant throne of the  Commander of the Faithful: unable to repress his feelings, he advanced slowly  towards it, and, having prostrated himself before it, remained for some time in  the most humble position, as if the Khalif were sitting on it. He was next  conducted by the eunuchs to a pavilion in the northern extremity of the [western]  hall, where he was told to sit down on a raised cushion covered with gold brocade.

After this, at a signal made by Ja’far, a dress of honour, which the Khalif had  destined for Ordofio, was produced. It consisted of a tunic’® of gold tissue, and a  bornis of the same material, with a belt’? of the purest gold, set with pearls  and rubies of such magnitude and beauty that the eyes of the barbarian rested  complacently on them; and whilst Ja’far was dressing him, he fell down on his  knees and prayed aloud [for the Khalif’s preservation]. This being done, Ja’far  sent for every one of the Christians who came in Ordofio’s suite, and gave each  a dress according to his rank ; after which they all left the room with the greatest  humility, returning thanks for the signal favour they had just received. After  traversing the same halls and the open terrace through which he had come,  Ordofio, followed by the Christians of his suite, arrived at the central pavilion  where he had alighted, and where by the Khalif’s order a generous steed richly  caparisoned, and having the saddle and bridle ornamented with pure gold, was  prepared for him. Ordofio mounted, and, accompanied by Ibn Tamis, returned  to his dwelling in the palace of the Rissdfah,” which had been provided with every  article suitable to one of his rank,—furniture, beds, earthenware, &c. In this  palace Ordofio and the Christians of his suite stayed until the moment of their  departure, receiving daily the choicest provisions for their consumption, and being  otherwise provided with every comfort or luxury. For a long time after, the  people of Cordova talked of nothing else than the rejoicings of that day, and the  glorious manifestation of Islam. The orators and poets, who were present at  the ceremony, failed not, as was the custom on such occasions, to deliver extempore  speeches or poems allusive to the scene they had witnessed; but as it would take  us far from our subject to quote any of those compositions here, we shall omit  them for brevity sake.”   In the mean while his cousin Sancho, the son of Ramiro, seeing the tempest  gather over his head, sent a message to the Khalif, in his own name as well as  in that of the counts and bishops of Galicia and Zamora, offering his submission,  and imploring him to accept of it, and to continue to him the favours and protection  which his father, An-ndsir, had dispensed to them. Upon which Al-hakem  consented to grant his request, on condition that he would demolish all the fortresses",203,book_6,

This Ludherik was a powerful chieftain, whose states  bordered™ upon Galicia. Having first dispatched the great officers of his court  to meet the Christian princess, the Khalif received her in state, granted the peace  she requested on behalf of her son, and gave her a large sum of money to be  distributed among her attendants, besides a rich present for herself. The day  of her entrance into Cordova was a day of festival, great crowds of people flocking  to witness the imposing sight. She came mounted on a swift mule, the saddle  and bit of which were richly ornamented with gold, and the covering made of silk  cloth, also embroidered with gold. The audience being over, the princess bade  farewell to return to her country; but before her departure [for Castile] she had  another audience of the Khalif, who received her as graciously as before, and  made her suitable presents for her journey.   ppections After the death of Abi-l-’aysh, the Idrisite, who, as before related, was killed  in an encounter with the Christians of Andalus, his brother, Al-hasan Ibn Kantin,  whom he had appointed to govern during his absence, succeeded him in the  kingdom.* Al-hasan persevered in his allegiance to the Beni Umeyyah, and  caused the khotbah to be said in their name in all the mosques of his dominions.  Subsequently to this, Balkin Ibn Zeyri Ibn Mendd As-sanhdji, a Berber chieftain  residing in Eastern Africa, who had embraced the religious opinions of the  ’Obeydites, invaded also Western Africa, and completed the work begun by Jauhar,",204,book_6,
"    CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 167    by putting an end in that country to the rule of the Beni Umeyyah. This state of  things continued until Mu’izz Ibn Ismd’il, the Fatimite, having heard that the  power of the Cordovan Khalifate was daily waxing stronger, decided upon sending  into Western Africa his general, Jauhar, to stop the progress of their arms. Ya’la  Ibn Mohammed Al-yefereni, chief of the tribe of Yeferen, whom An-ndsir had  put in command of Tangiers, went out to meet the Shiite general, but was defeated  and slain. Jauhar then laid siege to Fez, which he reduced, putting to death  the governor appointed by An-nasir, after which he returned to Eastern Africa.  When this disastrous news reached Cordova, all good Moslems were greatly  afflicted ; for the appearance in the neighbouring country of a power so hostile  to the principles of the Sunnah or traditional law could not but deeply concern  all those who wished for the glorious manifestation of Isl4m in its full purity.  Accordingly, in the year 362 (Oct. 11, a.p. 972), Al-hakem sent his mauli,  Ghalib, to Africa, at the head of considerable forces, with instructions not to  return to Andalus until he had completely exterminated all his enemies. Ghalib’s  first step was to invest the impregnable fortress of Hajaru-n-nasr,” wherein Al-  hasan Ibn Kanin had shut himself up with his women and his treasures. Having  reduced it, and taken Al-hasan prisoner, Ghalib proceeded to Fez, which he  entered without opposition, re-establishing in that capital, as well as in all Western  Africa, the supremacy of the Beni Umeyyah. After this, Ghalib prepared to return  with his royal captive to Cordova. Having left Fez about the end of Ramadhdn,  363 (June, a.pv. 974), he proceeded to Ceuta, where he embarked with all his  suite. On his landing at Algesiras he dispatched a messenger to Al-hakem,  informing him of the victories he had gained, and of the princes of the house  of ’Ali who came [like so many prisoners] with him. Al-hakem had no sooner  heard the message than he issued orders that all the civil functionaries of his court,  all the Kadis and theologians, accompanied by their respective tabakdt (classes of  students), and strong detachments from every division of the army, should go  out to receive and greet the victor. The Khalif himself went out some distance  from the capital, attended by his courtiers, the principal officers of his household,  and his Sclavonian guard, mounted on milk-white steeds richly caparisoned and  covered with glittering mail. ‘The spectacle was truly grand and imposing,”  says that most judicious and entertaining of all historians, Ibnu Hayydn; ‘‘ Ghalib  ‘* rode a beautiful chestnut horse ; he was armed cap-d-pié in a suit of steel armour  “inlaid with pure gold. At his right was Al-hasan Ibn Kantin, who had no  ‘sooner perceived Al-hakem in the distance, than he dismounted and proceeded  ‘on foot to kiss the hand of the Khalif, who received him most graciously, and  ‘* pardoned him his offences, as well as those of the other [prisoners] who came",205,book_6,

He became  also a favourite of Al-hakem, who failed not to profit by his instruction. Al-kali,  however, was not the only person of eminence who left the East to settle in the  dominions of Al-hakem ; for the fame of his repeated successes both in Africa and  in Andalus, of his liberality to the learned, and of the tranquillity which prevailed  in the territories subject to Islam owing to his wise measures and to his zeal  for the administration of justice, induced numbers of illustrious Moslems to repair  to Andalus. We shall here mention a few.   Abdi Bekr Al-azrak, a descendant of Moslemah, son of the Khalif ’Abdu-]-malek  Ibn Merwan: having left Cairo, his native city, for Africa in the year 343  (beginning May 4, a. p. 954), he arrived at Cairwan, where the Shiites were then  all-powerful; but as he refused to embrace the cause of those sectarians, he was  persecuted and confined in a dungeon at Mehediyyah. He was afterwards released,  and crossed over to Andalus in 349 (March 2, 960), and arrived in Cordova,  where he settled, and was [afterwards]™ kindly treated by Al-hakem. Abt Bekr  was a learned and virtuous man. He was born in 329 at Cairo; he died at  Cordova in the month of Dhi-l-k’adah of the year 385 (Dec. a. pv. 995).   Thafar Al-baghdddi, the chief of the scribes of his time, came from Baghdad,  and settled in Cordova. He was one of the many excellent scribes who lived in  that capital about the same time, and whom Al-hakem kept in his pay, as  Al-’abbds Ibn ’Omar As-sikili (from Sicily), Yusuf Al-bolitti,® and their disciples.  Being one of the best for correctness and beauty of hand-writing, soon after his  arrival in Cordova the Khalif took him into his service, and employed him in  transcribing books, of which duty he acquitted himself in a most admirable  manner.   Ismé’il Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmdn Ibn ’Ali Al-korayshi, a descendant of ’Abd Ibn  Zam’ah, the brother of Sawddah, the mother of the believers and wife of the  Prophet. (May the favours of God be on her!) On the occupation of Egypt by  the ’Obeydites, he left Cairo, his native city, and went to Western Africa, whence  he crossed over to Andalus, and settled at Seville. He became celebrated for his  works on various subjects.   The Khalif Al-hakem surpassed every one of his predecessors in love of literature  and the sciences, which he himself cultivated with success and fostered in his",206,book_6,
"    CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 169    dominions ; indeed he is well known to have converted Andalus into a great market  whereto the literary productions of every clime were immediately brought for sale.  He would besides employ merchants and agents to collect books for him in distant His passion for  countries ; to which end he would remit to them large sums of money from his  treasury, until the number of books thus conveyed to Andalus exceeded all  calculation. He would likewise send presents of money to celebrated authors in  the East, with a view to encourage the publication of works, or to obtain the first  copies of them. In this manner, knowing that Abi-l-faraj, of Ispahén, who  belonged to the [royal] family of Umeyyah, had written a work entitled Kitdbu-l-  aghdnt (the book of songs), he sent him one thousand dinars of pure gold; upon  which the author forwarded him a copy of his work, even before it had appeared  in “Irék. He did the same thing with Abi Bekr Al-abhari Al-mdleki, who  published a commentary on the Mokhtassar® of Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakem ; and with  other illustrious authors of his days. Al-hakem, moreover, collected round him  and employed in his own palace the most skilful men of his time in the art of  transcribing, binding, or illuminating books; and such literary treasures were  amassed in Andalus as no sovereign ever possessed before or after him, if we except  the library which is said to have been collected by [the Sultan] An-ndsir, son of  Al-mustadhf-billah,? of the house of ’Abbds. This immense collection of books  remained in the palace of Cordova, until, during the siege of that capital by the  Berbers, the Hajib Wadheh, who was a freedman of Al-manstr Ibn Abi ’A’mir,  ordered them to be sold, the remainder being shortly after plundered and destroyed  on the taking of that city by the Berbers. So far Ibnu Khaldiin, whose narrative  we have abridged; but in order to give an idea of the number of books collected  by Al-hakem we shall here transcribe the words of Ibnu-l-abbér in his Tekmtlah  (complement): ‘‘ Abi Mohammed Ibn Hazm says, I was told by Talid, the eunuch,  “‘ who was the keeper of the library and repository of the sciences in the palace of  “the Beni Merwan, that the catalogue only of the books consisted of forty-four  “‘ volumes, each volume having twenty sheets of paper, which contained nothing  “ else but the titles and descriptions of the books.”   Another historian, after transcribing the above passage, says, ‘‘ Al-hakem was mite found-  “the most virtuous and liberal of men; and he treated all those who came to  “ his court with the utmost kindness. He amassed such a collection of books  “that it is impossible to estimate even approximatively either their value or their  “number, some writers stating that they amounted to four hundred thousand  “* volumes ; and that when they were removed [from the palace] six months were  “‘ expended in the operation.

The latter gave  “him permission to cite him [in his writings]; and Al-hakem did so, as well  “as a great number [of other doctors]. He caused works on all subjects to be  ‘ conveyed to Cordova from every country, however remote, lavishing his treasures  “in the acquisition of them, until the number of books thus collected was such  “that they could no longer be contained in his libraries. He was, moreover, so  “ fond of reading, that he preferred the pleasure of perusing his books to all the  “* enjoyments which royalty can afford; by which means he considerably increased  “‘ his learning, doubled his information, and improved his taste. In the knowledge  “ of history, biography, and genealogy, he was surpassed by no living author of  “his days. He wrote a voluminous history of Andalus, filled with precious  ‘‘ information; and so sound was the criticism which he displayed in it, that  ‘“‘ whatever he related [as borrowed from more ancient sources] might be con-  ‘* fidently believed to be a fact.”   “To give an idea of Al-hakem’s immense erudition,” says the historian Ibnu-l-  abbar, “it will only be necessary to record here a well-ascertained fact—though,  “* strange to say, neither Ibnu-l-faradhi nor Ibn Bashkiwdl have mentioned it in  “their works—namely: that not one book was to be found in Al-hakem’s library,  “whatever might be its contents, which the Khalif had not perused, writing on  “the fly-leaf, the name, surname, and patronymic of the author; that of the  “tribe or family to which he belonged; the year of his birth and death; after  ‘which followed such interesting anecdotes about the author or his work as  “ through his immense reading he had derived from other writers.”   \ ee We shall conclude our account of Al-hakem by mentioning a few only of the  at his court. most eminent authors who flourished under this reign, and who contributed by  their works to diffuse the rays of science throughout Andalus.   Abii ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn ’Abdin Al-’odhri, the celebrated physician,  was one of the most eminent men of Al-hakem’s court. In order to improve  his learning in medicine and botany, in both of which sciences he was already  very proficient, he travelled to Egypt, where he obtained for some time the  direction of an hospital. He then returned to Andalus, and was greatly dis-  tinguished by Al-hakem, who appointed him his chief physician.   Ibn Mufarraj [Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed]. This was a learned theologian,  who wrote for the use of the Khalif several treatises on the legal decisions of  Az-zahri [Mohammed Ibn Moslem] and on those of Al-basri [Abi Sa’id Al-hasan  Ibn Yesar]. The poet Ibn Mughith** made likewise for the Khalif’s own library  a collection of the verses of the Beni Umeyyah, similar in size and design to that",208,book_6,

Mohammed Ibn  Yusuf At-tdrikhi, better known by his surname of Al-warrdk (the paper-merchant),  wrote by the command of Al-hakem several works on the history and topography  of Africa.*”7_ Isa Ibn Mohammed Abi-l-asbagh became celebrated for his excellent  history of Elvira and the lives of eminent men, natives thereof. Abdi ’Amru  Ahmed Ibn Faraj,* a native of Jaen, compiled from the most authentic sources  a voluminous history of Andalus, dwelling principally on the commendable deeds  of the Sultans of the house of Merwdn (the Beni Umeyyah) ; and lastly, Ya’ish  Tbn Sa’id Ibn Mohammed Abi ’Othmén,* who had been a disciple of the celebrated  Kasim Ibn Asbagh, of Baena, was also the author of a general history of Andalus.  Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-l-m4lik Ibn Hishém Al-makiéwi, Yusuf Ibn Hardin Ar-rdmedi,  Abi-l-walid Yiinas Al-bathalidsi, Ahmed Ibn Sa’id Ibn Ibr4him Al-hamdani, were  all distinguished poets of Al-hakem’s court, and enjoyed the favour of that Khalif.  Mohammed Az-zubeydi, the author of the celebrated Kitdbu-I-’ayn, one of the  best Arabic dictionaries that exist, whom Al-hakem appointed preceptor to his  son Hisham; Ibnu-s-sid, who wrote a valuable treatise on the language, besides  another work on the same subject in the form of a dialogue, consisting of upwards  of one hundred volumes; Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi, who, besides his historical  cyclopedia, entitled Al-’ikd (the necklace), compesed many excellent works  which are to this day the delight of the lovers of literature; and several other  authors of note, whose names we omit for the sake of brevity, flourished under  this reign. :   Al-hakem was a just and enlightened ruler; he attended public worship every Charter of  Friday, and distributed alms to the poor. Being himself very strict in the observance  of religious duties, he caused all the precepts of the Sunnah to be enforced through-  out his dominions. Perceiving that the use of wine and other spirituous liquors  forbidden by law had become quite common in Andalus, owing to the tolerance  or negligence of former Sultans, he ordered that all the vines in his dominions  should be rooted up; but upon being told by one of his wisest counsellors that  many poor people would be ruined in consequence of the measure, and that,  moreover, if the people were inclined to sin they might import wine from the  Christian countries, or make it themselves with figs and other fruits possessing  inebriating qualities, he recalled the order, although he directed the Kadis and  other public officers to inflict summary punishment on all those who were convicted  of dealing in spirituous liquors, or of having used them at weddings and other  festivities.

He lavished, besides, countless treasures in the construction of mosques,  houses of reception for the poof, hospitals for the sick, and colleges for the youth ;  and he ornamented his capital, as well as other large cities in his dominions, with  baths, inns, markets, fountains, and other works of public utility.   His forbearance in the exercise of power, and his extreme attention towards  learned or pious people, has become proverbial, and we shall give a remarkable  instance of it in the words of an author named Abi-l-k4sim Ibn Mufarraj. ‘‘I was  “of a contrary opinion to that followed by the Faquih Abi Ibrahim on several  “* points of law and traditions, and yet I was in the habit of attending the lectures  “‘ which he delivered on those sciences at a mosque close to his house, of which  “he was Im4m. The mosque was called the mosque of Abd ’Othm4n, and it  *‘ stood to the north-west of the royal palace; the hour was between the two  ‘* prayers of noon and sun-set, and the concourse of Talbes [students] and others  ‘* on that day happened to be greater than usual. We were all listening in silence  “to what Abi Ibrahim had to say, when behold! in came one of the eunuchs  ‘* of the palace belonging to the class of the letter-bearers, who brought a message  ‘* from the Khalif Al-hakem. On entering the mosque the eunuch stooped, saluted  “ Abi Ibr4him, and addressed him thus: ‘O Faquih! the Commander of the  “Faithful (may God prolong his life!) wishes to see thee, and he is waiting for  ‘* thee; so make haste: make haste; quick, quick !’—‘I hear the Sultdn’s order,’  ‘* said Abi Ibrahim, ‘ and would willingly obey it, were it not that I am prevented  ‘and cannot [at present] use speed. Go back to thy master and mine, (may  “God pour his favours on him!) and tell him how thou hast found me in one  ‘‘ of the houses of God, (may his name be exalted!) surrounded by a number of  ‘* students, to whom I am recounting traditions respecting his uncle (the Prophet).  ‘* Tell him that these students are attentively listening to my words and profiting  “by my lesson, and that it behoves me not to interrupt the subject upon which  “T am lecturing to them until the sitting be at an end and the hour come for  “my dismissing them.

Bdbu-s-sand’ah (the gate of the fabric), which is the nearest  ‘« gate of the royal palace from here, is shut. If the Commander of the Faithful  ** will condescend to have it opened, in that case I may easily walk to his palace  ‘‘ without any injury to my person. I therefore desire thee to return to the Sultan  “and acquaint him with this my determination, in order that I may hear his  *« pleasure and act accordingly. Go! I see thou art a steady, well-meaning youth,  “and I wish thee all sorts of prosperity.’ The eunuch took his departure, and  ‘“‘ returned some time after, saying, ‘O Faquih! the Commander of the Faithful  “has granted thy request, and ordered the Bdbu-s-sand’ah to be opened for thy  ‘ reception ; he himself is waiting for thee close to it, and through it I left the  ‘‘ palace to come here. My instructions this time are to remain by thee, until  ‘ thou hast finished thy present occupation, and to remind thee of the object of  ** my visit.’—‘ I will do so shortly,’ was Abi Ibréhim’s reply. The eunuch then sat  ‘* down, and waited until Abi Ibréhim had finished his lecture, and had expounded  “‘ according to his daily practice without suppressing one sentence. The lecture  ‘ being over, Abi Ibrahim got up and went to his dwelling, where he washed and  “« dressed ; after which he repaired to the presence of Al-hakem, entered the palace  “by the gate of Sand’ah, dispatched the business for which he had been called,  ‘and went out by the same gate, which was immediately locked after his  “ departure.”   Abi-l-k4sim Ibn Mufarraj continues: ‘“‘I happened that very evening, after  “‘ quitting the mosque in which Abi Ibréhim had been lecturing, to pass by the  “« gate of Sand’ah, which by the order of the Khalif was continually kept shut,  “‘ and, to my great astonishment, I found it wide open, as the eunuch had stated,  ‘‘and filled with servants and porters bustling and moving to and fro under  “ the gate-way, and expecting the arrival of Abi Ibrahim.

On the death of Al-hakem, his son Hisham, surnamed Al-muyyed-billah (the Accession of  assisted by God), who was only nine years old at the time,’ succeeded to the   throne. A man, however, named Mohammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir, whom Al-hakem   had promoted from the rank of Kadi to that of Wizir to his son,? succeeded by   his intrigues in usurping all the authority of the state, and reigning, as it were,   in his name.   According to Ibnu Khaldiin, Mohammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir rose in favour with  Al-hakem. When that Khalif died and was succeeded by his youthful son  Hisham, it was Mohammed who accepted and fulfilled the commission of putting  to death Al-mugheyrah, the brother of Al-hakem, who aspired to the throne.  This Al-mugheyrah, who was the son of the Khalif An-ndsir, was at the head  of a considerable party in Cordova, who preferred him to his nephew Hisham on  account of his more mature age and greater experience in affairs of government ;  but with the assistance of Ja’far Ibn ’Othman Al-mus‘hafi, who had been Al-  hakem’s Hajib (chamberlain), of Ghalib, the governor of Medinaceli, and of the  Sclavonian eunuchs of the palace, whose chiefs at the time were Fayik and Jidhar,*  Mohammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir surprised Al-mugheyrah in his dwelling and put him  to death two days after the death of Al-hakem, when Hisham was proclaimed  without opposition.

"    Conspiracy in  favour of his  uncle Al-mu-  gheyrah de-  tected,    176 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    the person of Hish4m and usurping his authority. To this end he began to plot  against the great officers of the state, and to raise dissensions among them, setting  them against each other, and employing one to kill the other. As he himself  belonged to one of the tribes of Yemen, that of Ma’éfer, being the descendant  of one ’Abdu-l-malek, who entered Andalus with Tarik and took a prominent  part in the conquest of that country, he had no difficulty at all in attaching to  his interests the chiefs of the Yemenite faction, which was then all-powerful.  Through their means he rose gradually into importance and became completely  the master of Hisham; he forbade the Wizirs to approach the person of their  sovereign except on particular days, when they were allowed merely to salute  him and then depart. He moreover lavished his gifts on the army, honoured  and exalted the learned, and destroyed all those who opposed him. He was  wise, provident, brave, had great military talents, and unparalleled zeal for religion.  All those functionaries of the state who opposed him and resisted his authority,  he destroyed one by one, either by depriving them of the offices they held, or  by making them slay each other. All this he did under Hishdm’s own signature  and by his orders; and he contrived so well, that within a short time after his  elevation he rid himself in some way or other of all those who stood in his way.  His first attacks were directed against the Sclavonian eunuchs of the palace,  who formed part of the Khalif’s body-guard. Having instigated the Hajib Al-  mus hafi against them, this functionary expelled them all from the palace, although  their number exceeded eight hundred. He then contracted an alliance with Ghalib,  the mauli of the Khalif Al-hakem, whose daughter he married, and by courting  his friendship and showing great obsequiousness towards him, he succeeded in  obtaining his assistance against Al-mus‘hafi, whose influence in the state he  ultimately destroyed. Against Ghdlib he employed Ja’far Ibn Ali Ibn Hamdin,  Lord of Masilah, and general of the Shiites [of Africa], who had a considerable  body of Berbers and Zendtah at his command, the same individual who had  opposed the authority of Al-hakem at the beginning of that Khalif’s reign.* Ja’far  he slew with the assistance of ’Abdu-l-wadtid Ibn Jeh’war Ibn Dhi-n-niin, and  other grandees of the state, who were the chiefs of the Arabian party.   Ibn Bessém, copying Ibnu Hayydn, says, ‘‘ When the Khalifate of the Beni  ‘* Merwén in Andalus came to Al-hakem, the ninth Im4m of that family, an event  “ took place which produced the most serious consequences. Among other virtues  “ Al-hakem possessed that of paternal love in such a degree that it blinded his  ‘* prudence and induced him to appoint a son of his, who was then a child, to  “be his successor, in preference to any of his brothers or nephews, all men of  “ mature age, well versed in the management of affairs and in the command of",214,book_6,

Perhaps Al-  ‘“hakem foresaw this, and wished to avoid the troubles that might arise, and he  “‘ accordingly designated his son Hish4m for his successor. However this may be,  “no sooner had Al-hakem breathed his last, than two of his Sclavonian eunuchs,  “named Fayik and Jiidhar, foreseeing the troubles and calamities that might arise  “from such a measure, conceived the idea of having his brother, Al-mugheyrah,  ' yaised to the throne instead of the youthful Hisham. ‘ Methinks,’ said Féyik  ‘one day to Jiidhar, ‘ we shall never be able to carry our plans into execution  “as long as Ja’far Al-mus’hafi lives; he must die.’—‘ And are we to begin our  ‘‘ undertaking,’ answered Jiidhar, ‘ by assassinating an old man, who is our master  ‘‘and our protector?’—‘ By Allah! I see no other way,’ replied Fayik. They  ‘then sent a message to Ja’far, to announce to him the death of Al-hakem, and  “at the same time to communicate to him their plans respecting Al-mugheyrah,  “‘ requesting him to give his opinion and advice on the subject. Al-mus‘hafi’s  “* answer was thus conceived: ‘ It is for you two to act, and for me to follow ; your  ‘* offices as master of the household and governor of the palaces give you respec-  “ tively great authority.” Upon which the two eunuchs agreed to carry their project  ‘into execution. Al-mus’hafi, however, left the palace, and, having assembled the  ‘ troops and their officers, announced to them the death of Al-hakem, and informed  “them of the plans of Féyik and Jiidhar to place Al-mugheyrah on the vacant  “ throne, to the prejudice of Hishdm, the appointed heir. ‘If we remain faithful to  ‘* our master’s son,’ said Al-mus’hafi to them, ‘ the empire is in our hands; if, on  ‘‘ the contrary, we consent to have another sovereign, we shall lose all power and  ‘‘ authority in the state.’ The soldiers answered unanimously, ‘ Thy opinion is also  ‘“‘ ours.” Al-mus hafi then hastened to dispatch Mohammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir with  ‘“a body of troops to the residence of Al-mugheyrah, with instructions to put  ‘him to death. Ibn Abi ’A’mir found Al-mugheyrah in complete ignorance of  ‘‘ what had occurred; he told him of his brother's death, and how his nephew,  ‘Hisham, had been seated on the vacant throne. At the receipt of this intel-  ‘* ligence, Al-mugheyrah was thunderstruck; but soon after recovering, he said,  ‘««] hear and obey the orders [of my new master].’ Not knowing how to act,  ‘““Tbn Abi ’A’mir sent a written message to Al-mus/hafi, acquainting him with  ‘‘what had occurred, and asking for further instructions. The answer was,   VOL. II. 2a    Execution of  Al-mugheyrah.",215,book_6,

Mohammed was born in a.u. 327,  (A.D. 939). His mother’s name was Boreyhah, and she was the daughter of  Yahya Ibn Zakariyy4 Ibn Bartal At-temimi. All those writers who have treated  of him, such as Ibnu Hayyan, in the history he wrote of the ’A’mirite dynasty,’—  Al-fath, in his Mattmah,—Al-hijéri, in his Mas'hab,—and Ash-shekundi, in his  At-taraf,—agree that Al-manstir was originally from a town called Toresh [Torres ?],  in the neighbourhood of Algesiras. His ancestor, ’Abdu-l-malek, was one of those ©  noble Arabs who entered Andalus at the same time with Térik Ibn Zeydd. His  father, Abdullah, surnamed Abt Hafss, was born at Algesiras, but removed when  young to Cordova, where he learned [sacred] traditions from Mohammed Ibn  ’Omar Ibn Lubdbah, Ahmed Ibn Khdled, Mohammed Ibn Foteys,® and other  eminent theologians of his time; composing also various works on the subject.  *Abdullah left Andalus for the East, where he fulfilled all the duties of a pilgrim.  He was an honest and virtuous man, very religious, and he led a very austere life,  keeping aloof from kings and great men. He died in Africa as he was returning  from his pilgrimage; some say at Tripoli, others at a place called Arkddah.® The  year of his death is not stated, but it is generally believed that he died towards  the close of An-ndsir’s reign.   When still young, Al-mansiir travelled to Cordova, where he studied and settled.  Having established a shop or office close to the gate of the royal palace, he for  some time earned his livelihood by writing letters or petitions for such among  the servants of the royal household as stood in need of them. At last, one of  the Sultan’s wives, named Sobha,'° who was the mother of Hish4m, happening to  want a confidential secretary, one of the eunuchs of the palace, who was an intimate  friend of Al-mansiir, recommended him to that princess, who at first employed  him in writing several things she wanted, and afterwards appointed him her  secretary. Being a shrewd and intelligent man, Al-manstr had no difficulty in  gaining the favour of the princess, who introduced him to her husband, the Sultén  Al-hakem, requesting him to confer on her protégé some lucrative appointment.  Al-hakem then made him Kédi of a town; and as Al-mansir distinguished himself  in that capacity, he was shortly after promoted to the office of collector of tithes  and duties upon inheritances at Seville. He then returned to Cordova, where  he so contrived to gain the heart of Sobha, by the rich presents he made her, and",216,book_6,
"    CHAP. VII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 179    his attention to her service, that no man in Cordova enjoyed so much favour.  His next office was that of master of the mint, which he filled for some time. An  interesting anecdote has been preserved, showing his kindness and his excessive  liberality even towards strangers, which happened at the time he was at the head of  that establishment. Mohammed Ibn Aflah, one of Al-hakem’s pages, had once  occasion to go to the mint for the purpose of selling some silver ornaments which  he possessed. ‘‘I had spent at my daughter’s wedding,” said the page to the  author who preserved the anecdote, ‘“‘more money than I could well afford, so  ‘ that I was actually reduced to poverty, and had nothing left save a bit and bridle  ‘* ornamented [with silver],!' which I took to the mint, in order to obtain its value  ‘in money. Being introduced to Mohammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir, who was at that  ‘time master of the mint, and whom I found sitting behind piles of coined  ‘ dirhems, I made known to him my errand, and told him how I had been reduced  “‘to poverty by my daughter’s wedding. Having listened attentively to my  “account, he seemed greatly rejoiced; and having weighed bridle, iron, leather,  “and all, he gave me the weight in dirhems, with which he filled my cap. I  “could hardly believe my senses: such a trait of generosity on the part of  ‘* Mohammed towards a stranger, whom he had never seen, so far captivated  “‘my heart, that had he then asked me to enter into a conspiracy to deprive  ‘‘my master Al-hakem of the throne, by Allah! I really think I should have  ‘* accepted his proposition. I need not add, that, upon counting down the money,  “‘T found there was enough to pay my daughter’s dowry; which I did, and had  ‘besides a large sum left for my own private use.”   It was also during his occupation of that office that Al-mansir caused a palace of  silver to be wrought, which he presented to Sobha. It was carried to the dwelling  of that princess on the heads of several men; and she was so pleased with the  present that from that day forward she became his patron, and that she again  introduced him to the presence of her lord and master, Al-hakem, who spoke  to his courtiers about it, and exclaimed, ‘“ By Allah! this youth (meaning Al-  ‘* manstir) has won the hearts and affections of our women with his presents.” It is  also related that Al-hakem, who was greatly addicted to astrology and the science  of divination, fancied that Ibn Abi ’A’mir (Al-mansiir) was the man mentioned  in (the book of the] prophecies. He used to say to those among his courtiers  who followed the same pursuits, ‘‘Do you not observe the tawny colour of his  “‘hands?’? On another occasion he said, ‘ If he has a sabre-cut on the head, he  “is doubtless the man announced.” And so it was; for God Almighty decreed  that some time after the death of Al-hakem, Al-mansir should receive some such  wound in a scuffle with Ghalib, the governor of Medinaceli, as we shall hereafter",217,book_6,
"    180 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK v1.    relate. This conversation passed in Al-hakem’s lifetime, and before Mohammed Ibn  Abi ’A’mir had reached the summit of eminence at which he afterwards arrived.  Al-mansir in the mean time did not neglect to make himself agreeable to the Hajib  Ja’far Ibn ’Othmén Al-mus‘hafi, whose protection and good-will he also secured.  On the death of Al-hakem, his son Hisham Al-muyyed, who was then twelve  years old, succeeded him. The Rim (Christians) having collected their forces,  and made some hostile demonstration upon the frontiers, Al-mus’hafi, who still  retained the post of Hajib, sent Al-manstir with an army against them. God  Almighty permitted that the Christians should be defeated, and that Al-mansir  should return victorious from the expedition. This circumstance gained him the  ‘affections of the people; and as he was a shrewd and intelligent man, and very  liberal [to those who seemed disposed to serve him], he began gradually to open for  himself a path to power. To rid himself of the Sclavonian guard, he united himself  with Al-mus’hafi, against whom he afterwards employed Ghdlib, the governor of  Medinaceli, whose daughter Asmé he married ; the nuptial festivity being celebrated  with a pomp that surpassed any thing of the sort in Andalus. He next destroyed  Ghilib, by raising up against him an enemy in Ja’far, the African, the same prince  in whose praise the celebrated poet, Ibn Hani,’? composed one of his best kasstdas.  In like manner he employed against Ja’far another chieftain named ’Abdu-r-rahman  Ibn Mohammed Ibn Hishdém At-tojibi.% In short, such were his craftiness, fore-  sight, and courage, that the historian Ibnu Hayyan has filled one volume with nothing  but the enumeration of the well-planned expedients he put into practice, in order  to obtain the supreme power. Such is the abstract of Al-mansir’s origin and the  principal incidents of his life, as derived from the works of Ibnu Sa’id and other  historians ; but what follows will, perhaps, throw greater light on the career of  that celebrated usurper. ,  SAE By the murder of his uncle, who was dispatched in the manner above related,  mus‘haff.  Hishdm saw himself firmly seated on the throne of his ancestors, and (Ja’far]  Al-mus‘hafi had the entire control of affairs. Ja’far began his administration  by showing great zeal for the welfare of the people, as well as great humility  and forbearance in the exercise of his functions. He laid aside all unnecessary  pomp, and sat along with the Wizirs and other members of the council on a  seat similar to theirs. These, however, may be called his only good acts; for  soon after he began to distribute the offices of the state [among his friends and  relatives], and to retain the public treasures for himself. Mohammed Ibn Abi  ’A’mir, who was in character the very reverse of Al-mus‘hafi, observed a different  conduct. To the avarice and exclusiveness of that Hajib he opposed the most  unbounded liberality, and to his reserve and haughtiness of temper the most",218,book_6,
"    CHAP. VII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 181    agreeable and prepossessing manners, by which means he so captivated the affections  of the people, that Al-mus‘hafi bethought him of taking him for his partner in the  administration, and appointing him to the post of Wizir. The zeal and talents  with which Mohammed fulfilled the duties of his office, and his renewed attention  to Sobha, the mother of Hisham, soon procured him the favour of that princess,  and he accordingly rose in power and influence. By his courtly demeanour and  fascinating manners, he so gained the affections of Sobha, that he became the  most esteemed officer of the royal household; and an order from the Khalif  Hishém came down enjoining his Hajib Al-mus‘hafi to consult him upon the  most arduous affairs of the government, and not to do any thing without his  previous consent. In obedience to that command, Al-mus‘hafi admitted Mo-  hammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir to his privacy, and treated him as a kind father would  his own son, concealing nothing from him, and consulting him upon all business  submitted to his consideration. But whilst Al-mus‘hafi acted thus towards Mo-  hammed, and relied confidently on him, the latter was secretly betraying him,  and trying to destroy him in the princess’s favour,'* by always following a contrary  advice, and charging him with the result of such measures as were not agreeable  to the people.   Mohammed persevered in this path [of intrigue and deception] until he suc-  ceeded in working the ruin of Al-mus‘hafi, and opening for himself the way to  exclusive power, as we shall presently relate. Certain of Al-hakem’s officers ®  being an obstacle to his ambitious views, he exiled some, and put others to  death, until he had scattered and dispersed them all, intrusting their offices to  creatures of his own, or to people in whom he could confide. He did the same  with the Sclavonian guard, which he dissolved and scattered through the country,  putting to death the most influential among them, or those who appeared most  obnoxious to his views. But as the events which we have just rapidly sketched  have been fully related by many diligent historians of those times, we will proceed  to give a few particulars from the most authentic and approved writers.   According to Ibnu Hayydn, there existed between the Hajib Al-mus‘hafi and  Ghalib, the governor of Medinaceli, the Sheikh of the maulis, and the champion  of Andalus,’® a bitter enmity and great rivalship, which caused them always to  be at variance with each other. Ghdlib being a very influential man, Al-mus‘hafi  saw his power gradually diminish and his orders continually disobeyed [by Ghalib],  until having complained of him to his fellow Wizirs, he was advised to try  every means of conciliation and to make his peace with him. No sooner was  Al-manstir informed of Al-mus’hafi’s determination, than, fearing his reconciliation  with Ghalib, he applied himself to court the friendship of the latter, with a view    Intrigues of  Al-mansir.    His alliance  with Ghalib.",219,book_6,
"    182 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book v1.    to accomplish the ruin of Al-mushafi through his means. It happened soon  after, that Ghélib went out of Cordova to take the command of the army on  the frontiers, whilst Al-manstr also left that capital upon his second expedition  against the infidels. Having met together on their return from their respective  campaigns, the two generals held a conference together, and pledged themselves  to effect in common the ruin of Al-mus‘hafi. Al-manstir returned to Cordova  victorious and laden with spoil, by which his fame spread far and wide, and  his reputation as a general increased. An order then came down from the Khalif  Hish4m, removing Al-mus‘hafi from the office of Wali-l-medinah,” which he  held at the time, and giving it to Al-mansir, who was also invested with a khil’ah  or dress of honour by his sovereign’s hands ; all this being done without Al-mus‘hafi  being previously made aware of it. By obtaining the command of the shortah,  or police force, Al-manstir opened for himself the gate [to power]. His next  care was to put in practice all manner of stratagems against Al-mus‘hafi, to isolate  him [from his friends], and to curtail his influence, until he succeeded in leaving  but a small share of real power in his hands. All this he accomplished with  the help of Ghélib, who, as before related, had agreed to connive with him at  the destruction of Al-mushafi.   Meanwhile Al-mansiir filled the functions of his office (WAli-l-medinah) in so  satisfactory a manner that the citizens of Cordova had no reason to regret the loss  of their former governors and magistrates. The greatest tranquillity and order pre-  vailed [through the city], and justice was speedily administered to the delinquent.  He continued, moreover, to court the friendship of Ghalib, and to conciliate his  favour by every means in his power. Al-mus‘hafi, on the other hand, being made  aware of the plans which Al-manstir was forming for his destruction, wrote a  letter to Ghélib, asking for a reconciliation, and applying, at the same time, for  the hand of his daughter Asmé for his son ""Othman. Ghélib consented, and the  proposed marriage was about to be celebrated, when Al-mansir, who happened  to hear of it, stirred himself and wrote to Ghalib, cautioning him against Al-  mus‘hafi, reviving his envy and hatred of that personage, and telling him to guard  against some treacherous act of his. He did more: he persuaded the relatives  and clansmen of Ghélib to write to him on the subject, until that chieftain, yielding  to their solicitations, broke off all negotiations with Al-mus‘hafi, and gave Al-  mansir the hand of the very daughter [Asmé] whom he had promised to Othman.  This alliance was concluded in the month of Moharram of the year 367, on the  night of naurus (new year’s day), August, a.p. 977, the marriage being celebrated  with unusual pomp and magnificence: the bride was first conducted to the royal  palace, where the Khalif Hisham received her in state, accompanying her after-",220,book_6,
"    CHAP. vul.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 183    wards to the bridegroom’s dwelling. These marks of distinction increased the  power and influence of Al-manstir, and doubled the number of his followers and  adherents, until, compared with him, Ja’far became a mere cipher.    After this the Sultan [Hisham] appointed Ghdlib to the office of Hajib (cham- Ghélib is ap-    berlain), conjointly with Ja’far Almus‘hafi, who, despairing of ever being able  to supplant his rival, gave up all resistance, and ceased to oppose him in the  affairs of the administration. Al-manstr, on the contrary, opposed him secretly,  as well as in public, detaching all his partisans, and gaining them over to his party,  until Ja’far was actually deserted by all his friends, and had to go alone morning  and evening to the palace, enjoying none of the prerogatives and power of his  office, which was merely nominal; a deserved punishment for the murder of  Al-mugheyrah and his help to Hisham’s accession !   Subsequently to this, Al-manstir [Mohammed Ibn Abi Amir] instigated his    pointed Hajib.    Al-mus’hafi  falls into dis-    sovereign Hish4m against Al-mus‘hafi, his children, relatives, friends, and every srace.    thing appertaining to them. A close account was demanded from them of all sums  [belonging to the state] which had passed through their hands; and on the  slightest pretext they were fined heavy sums, and reduced to poverty. By this  means Al-manstir succeeded in ruining and destroying that powerful family. A  nephew of Al-mus‘hafi, named Hish4m, was the first to feel all the weight of  his vengeance. This youth had accompanied Al-mansir in his third expedition  against the Christians ; and as that general was returning to Cordova with a great  number of heads stored in bags, as trophies of his victory, he stole one of the  bags, and rode off to the capital, where he bethought him of presenting them to  his sovereign before the arrival of his general. No sooner was Al-mansir made  aware of the fact, than he had the youth seized and confined in a dungeon, where  he was afterwards put to death. As to Ja’far, he soon shared the fate of his  nephew ; for when Al-mansir had ruined him and reduced him to poverty, so  much so that he was compelled to sell him his house in the Riss4fah, which was  one of the most magnificent residences in Cordova, he persecuted him for two  consecutive years, keeping him sometimes in prison, and sometimes out of prison,—  sometimes residing at court, at other times exiled,—always fined in heavy sums  of money, until he annihilated him entirely and broke his spirit, when he was    cast into one of the dungeons of Az-zahr4, where he ended his days, according Is imprisoned    and put to    to some authorities, from the effects of poison administered to him; and, according death.    to others, from grief and disappointment.   Treating of this unfortunate Wizir, the author of the historical work entitled  Raudhatu-l-azhdr wa bahjatu-n-nafus wa nozhatu-l-abssdér (the flower-garden, the  delight of the mind, and the recreation of the eye),’® says, ‘‘ When, in pursuance of",221,book_6,
"    184 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK v1.    ‘* Al-manstr’s orders, Al-mus’hafi was arrested and confined in one of the dungeons  “ of Az-zahrd, those among his friends and relatives, who had accompanied him  ‘thither, took an affectionate leave of him, and, with tears in their eyes, gave  “him the embrace of separation. ‘Friends!’ said Al-mus‘hafi to them, ‘ this  ‘is the last time that you will see me alive; for the moment is come when  ‘a prayer must needs be fulfilled, which I have been expecting for upwards of  ‘forty years.’ His friends having expressed a wish to know what the prayer was,  “ Al-mushafi informed them how, during the reign of An-ndsir, he had been  ‘* instrumental in committing to prison a man, who remained long in confinement.  “© One night,’ said Al-mus‘hafi, ‘I dreamed that I heard a voice saying to me,  ‘“‘ Take such a one out of prison, and whatever prayer he may happen to make in  “thy behalf will be attended to. I did as I was commanded, and liberated the  “man. Having then made him come to my house, I acquainted him with my  ‘“‘ dream, and asked him to form a prayer; upon which he said, I ask God that  ‘“‘ whoever was concerned in my committal to prison may himself perish in the  “narrowest dungeon! After this, friends!’ added Al-mus‘hafi, ‘there can: be  “no doubt that the man’s prayer is about to be fulfilled, since I was one of  ‘* those who put him in prison, although I afterwards repented of the deed when  “it was too late.’”   However, Al-mus‘hafi, as before related, died in prison, when his body was  given up to his friends for interment ; for the following anecdote has been preserved  by one of the Kétibs of Al-manstir, named Mohammed Ibn Isma’il. ‘1 once  “* accompanied Mohammed Ibn Moslemah to Az-zahré4 for the purpose of delivering  “ the body of Ja’far Ibn Othman Al-mus‘hafi to his friends and relatives, according  ‘to the instructions given us by Al-manstir. ""We proceeded to the apartment  ‘‘ of the deceased, whom we found stretched on his bed, and covered with an  ‘old tattered cloak which one of the gaolers had thrown over him. The body  ‘* was then washed upon the back of a door, which had been torn from its hinges  “ from ore of the rooms; after which it was carried to the burial-place, followed  “by none save the Im4m of the mosque, who had been engaged to recite the  ‘* funeral prayer over him, and by such among his sons as happened to be in  “‘ Cordova at the time. The sight of such a scene made me reflect upon the  “‘inconstancy of fortune; I recollected having once seen Ja’far ride from his -  “‘ own dwelling to the royal palace, followed by a numerous suite of relatives and  ‘adherents. The streets and markets through which he passed were thronged  “with people of every description, who were desirous to see him or had some  ‘* petition to present to him.

Shortly after this, Al-manstir became the  “enemy of Ja’far, had him imprisoned, and made him follow him in all his  “‘ campaigns, treating him with the greatest contempt. I happened, in one of  “ our expeditions to Galicia, to pitch my tent close to that of Ja’far. I recollect  “‘ very well that Al-manstr had issued orders that no fires should be lighted  “that night in the camp, for fear the enemy should discover our position, and  “‘ defeat his plans of attack; and, by Allah! I saw Ja’far with a little brazier  “of charcoal, which he dexterously concealed under his clothes, blowing now  ‘and then into it, lest the fire should go out. I saw more; I saw ’Othman,  “the son of Ja’far, carrying to his tent, and actually bending under the weight  “ of it, a large trough full of flour kneeded with water, the only food which he  “and his father had to keep themselves from starvation. I then heard ’Othmén  “ repeat the following verses :  ‘I strove in vain for a change of my fortune; I saw it return as often  ‘ and faithfully as the free maiden to the appointed meeting.  ‘ By Allah! the days roll on, but I cease not to be tormented by the  ‘ agonizing thought of my evil fate.  ‘ Days [these are] which invariably bring round a succession of calamities,  ‘and from which all happiness and joy have taken their departure :  ‘ Nights, the wearisome hours of which no pastime beguiles ; and in which  ‘ my misfortune itself sees nothing [pleasant] to be angry at.  ‘ But what are days but clouds, which pour down their contents sometimes  ‘ to benefit and sometimes to injure the earth ?’” 9  Thus died Ja’far Ibn ’Othmén Al-mus‘hafi: as to Ghdlib An-nésiri,” he soon  shared a similar fate. Having accompanied Al-mansir in one of his campaigns,  both generals happened to ascend to the top of a castle for the purpose of recon-  noitring the neighbouring country. A dispute having arisen between Al-mansir ——  and Ghalib [as to the best plan to be adopted], the latter grew exceedingly angry, with Gnaiib.  and said to Al-mansir, ‘‘ Thou dog! it was thou who spoiledst the monarchy  ‘and dismantledst the fortresses [on the enemy’s frontier], with a view to the  ‘‘ usurpation of the royal power.” He then drew his sword and attacked Al-  manstir, whom he wounded on the head; and he would undoubtedly have killed  him, had not some officers, who were present, prevented him by seizing his arm.  Fearing lest he might renew the attack upon his person, Ibn Abi ’A’mir preci-  pitated himself from the top of the ramparts; but God permitted that he should  find something in the air which broke his fall, and prevented his destruction.  His followers then took him up and conveyed him to his tent, where they took  care of him until he was entirely recovered. Ghalib, moreover, went over to  VOL. I. 28",223,book_6,

Thus did Al-mansir rid himself of all those who  proved an obstacle to his ambition.   Some time after these events, some coolness was visible in the relations between  Hishém and Al-manstir, owing to the calumnies of ill-intentioned people. Being  aware that the mischief could proceed from no other than the servants of the  palace, Al-mansir directed his attacks to that quarter, and he scattered them,  or ruined them, leaving none in place except those in whom he could trust, or  those from whom he had nothing to fear. He then learned that some of the  women of the harem had secretly laid their hands on the treasures of the Khalif,  which were always kept within the palace; he ascertained that Sidah (the queen  mother) Sobha, the sister of Réyik,?! whose feelings towards him were changed,  had taken large sums of money out of the royal coffers, having upon one single  occasion abstracted no less than one hundred sealed jars containing gold and  silver, which by her commands had been removed on the shoulders of the Scla-  vonian servants, after substituting in their room one hundred others, filled with  drugs and other things, taken from the palace of the Khalifs, causing labels to  be fixed to them similar to those on the jars which had been removed: she then  Managed to deceive the city governor, so that she was enabled to take the greater  part of her plunder out of Cordova unobserved. The amount of money in gold  and silver thus taken out of the royal treasury is said to have been eighty thousand  dinars. Ibn Abi ’A’mir having become informed of all these particulars, summoned  to his presence a number of the household, and informed them how the Khalif  Hishém, by his natural disposition, was averse to the hoarding of treasures, and  that he was besides very much given to devotion, and that should the coffers  of the state be drained (through his want of care], great detriment to the public  cause would ensue: he therefore advised them to transfer the said treasures to a  place of safety where they might be kept; and they were accordingly removed to  a strong castle, called Az-zahirah, which Ibn Abi ’A’mir had caused to be built  at some distance from Cordova. Five millions and seven hundred thousand dindrs  in specie is said to have been the amount of treasure which was taken from the  royal palace on this occasion. Sobha, too, was obliged to restore all the sums which  she had taken from the treasury and had not yet removed from the palace. Ibn Abi  ’A’mir became as intimate as ever with the Khalif Hisham, and made himself known  to him for his virtue and his zeal in upholding the foundations of the state; the  tongue of envy became dumb, and the plans of the malevolent were defeated.",224,book_6,
"    CHAP. VII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 187    Having in this manner rid himself of all those who stood near the throne or  from whom he might apprehend opposition in the government, Al-mansiir turned  his attention towards the army, which he began to remodel so as to place it entirely  at his own disposal. For this end he sent people to Africa, to enlist a number  of Berbers and Zendtah, whom he divided into companies, the command of which 7wt.bever  he gave to African chiefs of the tribes of Senh4jah, Maghr4wah, Beni Yeferen, Beni  Birzal, Meknésah, and others. This being done, he seized the person of Hish4m  and concealed him from the sight [of his subjects]: he then usurped all the  authority in the state, and from his private dwelling in Cordova he filled the  world with the greatness of the Khalifate and the reverential awe which it inspires,  having his absolute will in all things; declaring and carrying on war against  the infidels and others, and enjoying all those prerogatives which appertain only  to royalty. In order the better to strengthen himself in the position which he  had taken, he removed the Arabs from all posts of honour and distinction, and  advanced the Berbers, the Zendtah, and others, whom he had invited from Africa.  In this manner he accomplished his purpose, usurping the sovereignty, and ruling  with absolute sway. He moreover built himself a strong castle and a palace to Builds himselt  reside in, which he named Medinat Az-zéhirah,” into which he conveyed all the*™"" castle.  treasures and military stores [of the state], and where he sat, as above related, on  the throne of the kings, and caused himself to be addressed in royal style, assuming  the titles of Al-h4jib and Al-manstir (the chamberlain, the victorious). All letters,  proclamations, and commands, were moreover issued in his own name: he ordered  that a prayer should be offered up for him from the pulpit after the usual one  for the Khalif Hisham. The rights and insignia of the Khalifate were entirely  obliterated, and nothing remained to Hish4m Al-muyyed except the putting of his  name on the coins and on the skirt of the royal robes called tirdz, two prerogatives  which Al-mansir also enjoyed at the same time; for he caused his own name to be  struck on the silver and gold coins,* and to be woven into the stuff called tirdz.  All other rights and prerogatives were dexterously, and by degrees, snatched ee  from the helpless monarch, who preserved only such a share of authority as his  powerful Héjib was pleased to allow him. Al-manstir moreover formed into an  army the Berbers and Mamelukes, and surrounded his person with a multitude  of slaves and foreigners, by the help of whom he maintained himself in the position  (which he had usurped], and was enabled to overwhelm all those who offered  him any opposition, or who attempted to compete with him; and through whose  means he accomplished whatever he undertook. He led his armies to the theatre  of war, and fought during his administration fifty-six pitched battles, in which  he invariably came off victorious; since upon no occasion was the army he",225,book_6,

He sent over his forces to Africa, where he excited  dissension among the native tribes and the princes [ruling over them] until they  destroyed each other and he became the absolute ruler of Western Africa, the  chiefs of the tribe of Zendtah submitting to him and acknowledging his sway.  He sent over to Africa his son, ’Abdu-l-malek, against the Beni Khazr and their  chief Zeyri Ibn ’Atiyah, at that time Lord of the Maghrawah and ruler of Fez.  Having heard that the Berber chieftain, who had formerly been on very good terms  with him, had spoken disrespectfully of him on several occasions, and had often  alluded to the state of confinement and seclusion in which he kept his sovereign  Hisham, Al-manstir determined upon chastising him: for which end he prepared  a large expedition, the command of which he intrusted to his eldest son, ’Abdu-1-  malek, who defeated the rebel and deprived him of his states, as will be related  hereafter. ,   But to proceed with our narrative. ‘‘ Soon after the death of Al-hakem,” says  Ibnu Hayyén, ‘{ the Christians collected their forces and attacked the Moslems  ‘on the frontiers, extending their incursions till within sight of Cordova; owing  “ chiefly to their not having found in Al-mus‘hafi either the resources or the vigour  ‘* which ought to have been opposed to them. They say that upon one occasion  “* the people of Kal’ah Rabbéh (Calatrava) having complained to him of the frequent  “inroads which the Christians were making into their territory, he ordered them to  ‘‘ destroy the bridge™ upon their river (the Tagus), under the impression that he  ‘“‘ would thereby prevent the incursions of the enemy. But this measure was far  “ from producing the desired effect ; and, although the army was then numerous,  “and the coffers of the state were well filled, [yet the Christians continued their  ‘‘incursions.] This was one of Al-mus’hafi’s errors. Mohammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir,  ‘©on the other hand, having received intelligence from Calatrava, advised Ja’far  ‘to collect his army and march against the enemy, reminding him at the same  “* time of the eternal chastisements reserved for those who do not wage war against  “the infidels. Moved by his arguments, the Hajib summoned the Wizirs to a  “ council of war, and having taken their advice, decided upon making an incursion  ‘into the enemy’s territory; the command of the army being intrusted to Mo-  “ hammed [Al-mansir], who received the sum of one hundred thousand gold din4rs  “ [for the payment of the forces]. Mohammed departed at the head of the army,  “and having reached the Thager Al-jauft (the north-western part of the province  ** of Toledo), laid siege to a fortified town called Al-hammah, entered and plundered  “its suburb, and, after an absence of fifty-two days, returned to the capital  “triumphant, bringing with him a number of captives and considerable spoil.",226,book_6,

VII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 189    “The news of this success filled the inhabitants of Cordova with joy, and gained  “‘ Mohammed the hearts of the soldiers, who, perceiving his virtues and his talents,  “* were eager to die in his service.”   In the year 372, (beginning June 25, a.p. 982,) Al-mansiir made an incursion into  the land of the Galicians, with a view to the destruction of Ashtorikah (Astorga)  and Liinish (Leon), two populous cities of those districts. The Christians, however,  having received timely intelligence of the immense preparations made by Al-mansir,  deserted those cities, and fled to the mountains with such valuables as they could  remove ; upon which Al-manstr gave up his undertaking, and, after laying waste  the country, returned to Cordova. In the spring of the ensuing year (April—June,   a. D. 984,) Al-mansir made a sudden irruption into Galicia (Asturias) and marched  without opposition to Litnish (Leon), which he invested and took, putting the Destruction  inhabitants to the sword. He next ordered the demolition of the fortifications ; “'*""  but finding that, owing to the strength and thickness of the walls, the operation   was likely to last some time, he gave up his purpose, and proceeded to Ashtorikah  (Astorga), which he also took.   “In the year 375,” (beginning May 23, a.p. 985,) says one of the historians ieee  of Africa, ‘‘ Al-manstir sent over his cousin Abi-l-hakem ’Omar with a powerful  “army against Al-hasan Ibn Kaniin, the Idrisite, who had taken possession of  “ the city of Basrah in Maghreb (Western Africa). After besieging him for some  “time, Abii-l-hakem compelled his enemy to surrender at discretion and throw  “himself upon the mercy of Al-manstr; who was accordingly consulted as to  “* Al-hasan’s future destiny. But Al-manstr, tutored by experience, would not  “listen to the voice of mercy, and sent orders for the execution of the unfortunate  “ prince, whose head was accordingly forwarded to Cordova.”   In the month of Dhi-l-hajjah of the year 374 (May, a.p. 985,) Al-mansiir left  Cordova on a campaign to Catalonia, this being his twenty-third ?*. expedition  to the land of the infidels. He had previously made immense preparations, and  great levies of troops, causing the jihdd or holy war to be proclaimed throughout  the dominions of Islam. In order to provision his army, he directed his march  through the eastern provinces: he thus passed through Jaen, Elvira, Bastah  (Baza), and Tudmir. From the latter place he went to Valencia, and, after allowing  some rest to his troops, he entered the dominions of Boreyl (Borel), King of the  Franks, whom he defeated in a pitched battle, pursuing him till in sight of his  capital (Barcelona), which he besieged and took by the sword on Monday the Taking of Bar-  15th of Safar, a.a. 375 (May, a.p. 985). As usual, Al-manstr took with him  to this expedition a number of poets and authors, that they might record his \  high deeds during the campaign. As their names have been preserved by a",227,book_6,

There were besides several loads of bornuses and other articles of  “woollen cloth manufactured in Africa.” The object of the ambassadors was  to announce to Al-mansir the extensive conquests which their master, Zeyri, had  just made in Western Africa, the greater portion of which he had reduced, causing  the Khalif Hisham to be proclaimed in all the mosques thereof. The news of  this success filled the inhabitants of Cordova with delight, and Al-mansir dismissed  the ambassadors with suitable presents and a letter for the Lord of the Zenatah,  wherein he granted him in Hisham’s name the investiture of all those Cen)  which he had wrested from the enemies of the house of Umeyyah.   The ensuing year (a.a. 382, beginning March 8, a.p. 992) Zeyri Ibn ’Atiyah  in person visited Al-manstir in Cordova. This time he brought with him a present Vi ental that  still more valuable than the former, containing, among other inestimable objects,  a bird that could speak both Arabic and Berber, a musk bull, a wild ox, in  shape resembling a horse (the gnu?), and several other extraordinary quadrupeds ;  two immense lions in iron cages, many loads of dates of the best quality and  unusual size. Zeyri came attended by three hundred black slaves, all mounted  on horseback, and three hundred more on foot, besides a large retinue of followers  from his own tribe. He was received in state and with due pomp by Al-mansir,  who lodged him in the palace which had belonged to Ja’far Al-mus‘hafi, honoured  and distinguished him greatly during his stay in Cordova, conferred on him the  title of Wizir, made him a valuable return for his present, and confirmed him  in the possession of his African states. But whilst Zeyri was in Cordova news  came that the chief of the Beni Yefertin,“ named Yadu Ibn Ya’la, taking advantage  of his absence, had suddenly marched to Fez and entered the *Idwatu-l-Andalus,  (or that part of the city peopled by the Andalusians,) where he fortified himself.  Zeyri returned in all haste to Africa, and, having put himself at the head of his eel  forces, marched against his adversary, with whom he had many sharp encounters,  until at last he defeated and slew him, and regained possession of the capital in  the year 383 (beginning February 25, a.p. 993).

Enraged  at this, Zeyri commanded that Al-manstir’s name should no longer be mentioned  in the khotbah or public prayer as before ; although he persevered in his allegiance  to the Khalif Hishém, whom he acknowledged as his rightful sovereign. He  then prepared to resist any attacks that should be made upon him.   Al-mansir first sent an army under the command of a Sclavonian eunuch, named  Wadheh, who landed at Tangiers and proceeded towards Fez; but, being opposed  by Zeyri at the head of his Zendtah, he was defeated with great loss, and obliged  to fall back upon Tangiers, where he was immediately besieged by the victor.  Al-mansir then sent his son ’Abdu-l-malek, who not only defeated Zeyri in a  pitched battle near Wada-mena, on the 15th of Ramadhan, 387 (Nov. a.p. 997),    Is forcibly dis- but laid siege to Fez, and took that city, which he gave in sovereignty to the    possessed of his    government.

When the news of this victory reached Cordova, Al-mansir ordered that his  son’s letter to him should be read to the people in the mosque of Cordova, as  well as in the principal cities of his dominions, and that public rejoicings should  be made in commemoration of so signal a victory. He himself liberated fifteen  hundred slaves, and distributed large sums of money to the poor. Zeyri, however,  after the loss of his capital, retired to Tihart, where he spent some time; but,  not considering himself secure, even in that remote spot,** he went still further  [to Ashir, in the country of the Senhéjah], where he died in the year 391 (beginning  Nov. 30, a.p. 1000). Zeyri was succeeded by his son Al-mu’izz, who hastened  to make his submission to Al-mansir; upon which the Hajib, being pleased to  pardon his father’s offence, gave him possession of his family dominions on condition  that he should acknowledge himself the vassal of the Khalif Hishim, and should  yearly remit to Cordova a certain stipulated tribute. Al-mu’izz did so; and  remained faithful to the Beni Umeyyah until the overthrow of their empire by  the Sultans of the race of ’Ali Ibn Abi Talib.   Whilst the events above related were passing in Africa, Al-mansir was  prosecuting his success against the Christians of Andalus.

Suffice it to say, that during the long period  of his administration, he never failed to conduct his army twice every year, either  against the Franks or against the Galicians; and that in all his campaigns, which  appear to have been fifty-two in number, God Almighty was pleased to grant victory  to his arms, and to send down confusion and disappointment on the obdurate  unbelievers. We cannot, however, dismiss this interesting subject without transcribing  from the work of Ibnu Hayydn his account of Al-mansiir’s fiftieth‘? expedition  into the land of the infidels, which ended in the taking and destruction of their  capital, as it will afford our readers an idea of the march and arrangements of  Al-manstr’s armies, and the prosperous issue of all his military undertakings.   “Shant Yakoh (Santiago) is a city in the most remote part of Galicia, and Invasion of   “one of the sanctuaries most frequented, not only by the Christians of Andalus, ee  “but by the inhabitants of the neighbouring continent, who regard its church  “with veneration equal to that which the Moslems entertain for the Ka’bah at  “ Mekkah; for their Ka’bah is a colossal idol (statue) which they have in the  “centre of the church. They swear by it, and repair to it in pilgrimage from  “the most distant parts, from Rome as well as from other countries beyond [that  “ city]; pretending that the tomb, which is to be seen within the church, is that  “ of Yékob‘® (James), one of the twelve apostles, and the most beloved by ‘Isa  “« Jesus). May the blessing of God and salutation be on him and on our Prophet !  “The Christians call this Ydkob (a word which in their language means Ya’kib)  “ the brother of Jesus, because, while he lived, he was always with him. They say  “ that he was Bishop of Jerusalem, and that he wandered over the earth preaching  ‘the religion [of Christ], and calling upon the inhabitants to embrace it, until  “ he came to that remote corner of Andalus ; that he then returned to Syria, where  “* he died at the age of one hundred and twenty solar years. They pretend likewise  “ that after the death of Yakob his disciples carried his body and buried it in that  “church, as the most remote part where he had left traces [of his preaching].  “ None of the Moslem sovereigns [who preceded Al-mansiir] had ever thought  ‘““of penetrating as far as that city, or reducing it under the sway of Islam, owing  “to its inaccessible position, the strength of the spot on which it is situated, and  “the many dangers to be encountered on the road to it.

On his arrival at the city [capital] of Galicia he  ‘was met by a considerable number of the Christian counts, who acknowledged  ‘“‘ his authority, with their respective forces, all mounted and equipped [for war].  ‘* Having joined the Moslem troops, all together crossed the Christian frontier.   ‘* Al-manstr had previously given orders that a considerable fleet, well manned  ‘‘ with experienced mariners, and having a body of infantry on board, should  “ be fitted out at a port of the western coast of Andalus, called Kasr Abi Danis.  ‘* He had also caused provisions, arms, and every kind of military stores [for  “the use of his army] to be put on board as evidence of his foresight in military  ‘* affairs. Following his instructions, the fleet sailed along the coast to a port  * called Bortokél (Oporto) at the mouth of the river Diroh (Duero), which it  “ascended to the spot where Al-manstr intended to cross over to the opposite  “bank. There the fleet cast anchor, opposite to a fortress situated [on the right  “ bank]. A bridge was then constructed with the vessels, by means of which  ‘* the troops crossed over (to the other bank]; and having been plentifully supplied  ‘‘ with the provisions on board the fleet, they prosecuted their march into the  ‘“‘enemy’s country. Thence the army directed its course to Santiago, traversing  “extensive districts, and crossing large rivers and deep estuaries, into which the  ‘* green sea [Atlantic Ocean] pours its tides. The army then spread itself over  ‘“‘ the rich plains and well-cultivated districts of Fortdrish *? and the neighbouring  “country. They then came to a high inaccessible mountain to which there  ‘‘ was no approach or path, and the sides of which were so precipitous that the  “t puides [confessed] they had never seen the like of it; but by the command  ‘“‘ of Al-manstr the pickaxe was employed upon the rock, and after much exertion  “and labour a passage was opened sufficiently large to allow the army to pass  ‘through it. The Moslems, however, were amply rewarded for their fatigues  “on this occasion; for no sooner had they passed that range of mountains and  * crossed a river called W&da-Minoh (Mifio) than they found themselves among  ‘* wide-spread plains and well-cultivated lands, through which they arrived at a  “‘ monastery called Deyr Kasdn,®* then at the valley of Balanbu * upon the shores  “of the ocean, and next at the fortress of Shant Beld4y (Sanpayo), which last  “‘ was taken and plundered of every valuable. From this place the army crossed  “over to a neighbouring island on the ocean, where a great number of the  ‘* population of the districts attacked had taken refuge; but the Moslems took  ‘all those who were on the island prisoners. Thence the army went to the  “‘ mountain of Morasiah, which is surrounded on most sides by the ocean, and  “having traversed it in all directions, expelled all those who were on it, and  ‘collected considerable spoil.

This  “* sanctuary is held in great estimation by pious Christians, who look upon it  “‘as second only in sanctity to the church where the tomb is kept, and repair  “to it from the most remote parts [of Christendom], from Nubia, from the land  “‘ of the Kobts, and other distant countries. This place the Moslems completely  ‘* destroyed.   ‘‘The next march brought the army to Santiago, the doomed city. This was Taking and  ‘taken on Wednesday, the second day of the month of Sha’ban (Aug. 10, a. p. er seare  ‘© 997). The Moslems found the city deserted ; they took all the spoil which could  “be found, destroyed the public buildings and fortifications, and razed its church  “‘to the ground: the tomb only of St. James was preserved, Al-mansir having  “‘ appointed people to take care of it, and prevent any profanation. ll the public  “buildings [of Santiago] were very solid and of wonderful structure; yet they  “‘ were so completely destroyed, that nobody could have imagined [to see the flat  “ surface] that they had stood there only the day before.   “« After wasting the neighbouring country the army arrived at the island  ‘* (peninsula) of Shant Ménikas (San Cosme de Mayanca), where that region  ‘“‘ terminates abruptly upon the ocean, a spot which no Moslem had ever reached  “ before, and which no human foot had trodden except that of its native inhabitants.  “ There being no land to be seen beyond that island where the horses could move,  ‘« Al-manstir ordered a retreat, after having penetrated where no Moslem had  “ever been before him. Passing again by Santiago he directed his march to  ‘ the country occupied by Beremund Ibn Ordhiin (Bermudo, son of Ordofio,) with  “a view to the destruction and wasting of his territory. Having in this way  “ arrived at the districts of the allied counts who were in his army, he ordered  “his soldiers to desist from further ravages, and passing rapidly through their  “ territory, arrived at a castle called Beliko,*> which he had reduced (on a former  “ occasion]. Having there assembled the Christian counts who had assisted  ‘‘in the enterprise, he rewarded each man according to his rank, distributing  ‘“‘ dresses of honour among them and their followers; after which he dismissed  “them to their respective countries. In this campaign Al-mansir gave away  ‘to the Christian princes and others who had shown themselves the friends of  “the Moslems, two thousand two hundred and eighty-five pieces of the silken  “ stuff called tirdzt, of various colours and patterns; twenty-one dresses of seal-  ‘* skin ; © two dresses of the stuff called anbar ;*” eleven of scarlet cloth; fifteen",233,book_6,

The whole of the army then reached Cordova loaded  ‘“‘ with plunder, after experiencing [during the whole campaign] the favours and  “ protection of the Almighty. They say that the Moslems found no living soul  “at Santiago except an old monk who was sitting on the tomb of St. James.  “ Being interrogated by Al-mansiir as to himself and what he was doing in that  “ spot, he answered, ‘I am a familiar of St. James;’ upon which Al-mansir  “ ordered that no harm should be done unto him. It is also related that Al-mansir  “ ordered the bells of the church to be removed to Cordova on the shoulders  “of Christian captives, to be suspended [as lamps] from the ceiling of the great  ‘* mosque, to which a considerable addition was then being built by his orders.”  But we have already recorded the fact in our description of that capital.   We have elsewhere slightly alluded to the state of confinement and seclusion  in which Al-mansir kept his sovereign Hish4m. Indeed all contemporary historians  relate that his person was so carefully concealed from the sight of the public,  that many of his subjects never saw him once during their lives. It is true  that now and then Hishim would ride out with some of his women to some  garden or pleasure-house [in the neighbourhood of Cordova]; but on such occasions  he and his women were covered with bornuses, which concealed their figures and  prevented their being recognised by the people passing: a numerous escort,  moreover, cleared the road by which they had to pass. In this manner Hishém  reached the place of his destination, and, after spending some hours there, was  conducted back to his palace with equal care and secrecy. If Al-manstir was  absent from Cordova on some military expedition, he took care to appoint  confidential people, who saw his orders executed and kept a vigilant eye over  Hishém, taking care that none of his subjects should see him or approach him  on any consideration. However, towards the close of his. administration, Al-  manstir relaxed a little in his conduct; for, hearing that the people of Cordova,  most of whom had never seen Hish4m, murmured at his confinement, and even  gave out that he had put him to death, he produced him in public, and rode  that celebrated cavalcade, to witness which an innumerable concourse of people  left their dwellings. Hishém rode out ornamented with all the insignia of the  Khalifate, whilst Al-manstir walked before him with a rod in his hand, leading his  master’s steed by the bridle. In this manner they paraded the principal streets",234,book_6,
"    CHAP. viI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 197    of Cordova, and the eyes of the people feasted on what had so long been concealed  from them.   By this and other contrivances Al-manstir managed to concentrate in himself  all the power of the state, and to usurp the inheritance of the Beni Umeyyah.  Fearing lest the members of that royal family should revolt against him or oppose  the execution of his ambitious designs, he secretly dispatched, under various  pretences, all those who stood nearest to the throne, or who seemed more  dangerous to him, and the remainder he exiled to the provinces, obliging them  to hide themselves in obscure and retired cells, and to exchange the splendour and  magnificence of their convivial halls for a life of misery and privation in lonely  woods and dreary deserts. Alluding to this rapid change of fortune, a poet  has said— :   “O sons of Umeyyah! where are now your [princes shining like] full  ‘* moons in the dark night? where are your constellations ? where your stars ?   “ Your lions were absent from their native forests when this usurper seized  “on your empire.” °°   In the month of Safar,.a.u. 392 (Jan. a.p. 1002), Al-mansir prepared to  invade for the fifty-second time the country of the infidels, intending to direct  his attacks on the side of Kashtelah (Castile). Having summoned from Africa  a considerable body of troops, which met him at Toledo, he reached the banks  of the Diuroh (Duero), in the neighbourhood of which he committed great ravages  and depredations. Having thence ascended the river, he penetrated into the  dominions of the Count of Castile (Sancho Garcez), whom he found encamped  near a castle called Kal’at An-nosor (the castle of the eagles), with innumerable  troops collected from the neighbouring Christian kingdoms. Al-mansiir attacked  and defeated him with great loss.   On his return from this expedition Al-manstr was seized by an acute disorder, Death of   : : . A Al-mansur.  which caused his death. He, nevertheless, continued to wage war against the  infidels, and to waste their territory, until, his disease increasing, he was placed in a  wooden litter, on soft cushions, and covered with an awning and curtains. In  this manner he was carried on the shoulders of his men, surrounded by his troops,  until he arrived at Medinah Sélim (Medinaceli). His physicians being greatly  divided as to the nature of his complaint, it naturally aggravated until his life  was despaired of. He used to say, ‘‘I leave behind me twenty thousand clients,  ‘‘ all of whom are happy and contented; may they to-morrow have no worse  “master than myself!’ Perhaps he meant that twenty thousand warriors  attended him on that expedition; but, according to all accounts, the armies of  Andalus in his time amounted to a much greater number, since he is said to have",235,book_6,

But to return.   In his last moments Al-mansir showed great solicitude for the future destinies  of Cordova, and it is added that he began to weep, and expressed himself as if  he feared the immediate dissolution of the empire he had so powerfully extended  and strengthened. Some time before his death he sent for his son ’Abdu-l-malek  and some of his most confidential friends, and instructed them respectively [as to  the management of the government after his death]. He then desired to be left  alone with his son, to whom he repeated such instructions as he had already given  him in the presence of the others. Whenever ’Abdu-l-malek offered, with tears  in his eyes, to quit the room, that his father might take some rest, Al-manstr  retained him, and insisted upon his remaining. Then observing tears on his  countenance, Al-mansir reproached him with his want of courage, saying, ‘‘ This is  “to me the first signal of the approaching decay [of this empire].” He ordered  him to give the command of the troops to his brother ’Abdu-r-rahmén, and expired  on Monday, the 25th of Ramadh4n of the year 392 (Aug. 7, a.p. 1002),% at  the age of sixty-five, as he was born in the year 327 (Oct. 28, a.p. 938), or  the year of Al-handik (’A’mu-l-handik), as it was called by the people of Andalus,  owing to the disastrous battle of that name fought under the walls of Zamora  between the Christians and the Moslems.",236,book_6,

Ir has been remarked, that after the death of Al-manstir the Mohammedan empire  in Andalus began to give visible signs of decay: the Christians, who during the  administration of that victorious Hajib had been almost reduced to the condition  of slaves, put aside all their former fears, and, assailing the Moslem territory  on all sides with the greatest fury, aimed many mortal blows against the sinking  body of Islam. Although the valiant Almoravides, and the still more brave Al-  mohades, stayed for some time the ruin of the common cause, yet their splendid  victories were of no avail; and scarcely two centuries had elapsed since the death of  Al-mansir, when Toledo, Saragossa, Valencia, Cordova, Seville, and other im-  portant cities, which had once proved so many impregnable bulwarks, fell one by  one into the hands of the enemy of God, and prepared the way for the final subju-  gation of the peninsula by the insolent and accursed Christians.

During the reign of Hish4m II., and under the administration of Al-manstr,  literature and the sciences flourished in Cordova. Even the Sclavonian eunuchs  of the palace cultivated it with the greatest success; and Ibnu Hayy4n has pre-  served the names of several who distinguished themselves by their productions  in various kinds of literature. One of them was Fatin, who had not his equal  in the knowledge of the Arabic language, and at whose death in 420 (a. p. 1029),  a splendid collection of valuable books was sold. A Sclavonian named Habib is  said also to have written a work entitled ‘‘ clear proofs and victorious arguments  {in favour] of the excellences of the Sclavonic race,”! in which he introduced  all manner of entertaining anecdotes, history, and verses of the Sclavonians. Ibn  Joljol wrote his history of the Andalusian physicians, and ’Obddah Ibn Méi-s-sema  that of the Andalusian poets. Abi-l-mugheyrah Ibn Hazm, who was a Wizir of  Al-mansir, Abi-l-walid Ibnu-l-faradhi, Ibn Sahlin, Ibnu-d-dabbd4gh, Ibn Jesuir,  Abi ’Abdah Hasan Al-laghiwi, and Ydsuf Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr, wrote each a history  of his own times. Az-zubeydi wrote the lives of celebrated grammarians who  were natives of Andalus, as well as those of eminent lawyers and theologians ;  and Ahmed At-talamanki those of all the historians, with the titles of their works,  &c. We forbear mentioning the poets, theologians, orators, and rhetoricians who  flourished under this reign, for they were as numerous as the sands of the ocean.   Many men, too, distinguished by their talents or renowned for their proficiency  in some department of science or literature, visited Andalus under this reign,  and were induced, through the liberality of Al-mansir, to fix their residence in  Cordova. In their number were Ahmed Ibn ’Alf, a native of Baghdad, ’Abdullah  Ibn Ibrahim, Abi Bekr Al-azrak, Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-w4hed Az-zubeyri, sur-  named Abi-l-barakdt, a native of Mekka, Ahmed Ibn Fadhl Ad-dinawéri, and  others, who settled in the capital and became celebrated by their writings.?   Among the most celebrated was Abi ’Ali> S4’id Ibnu-l-huseyn Ibn Isa Ar-raba’i,  surnamed Al-laghiwi (the philologist), who was a native of Baghdad, but originally  from Maussal. Ibn Bessim says that Al-mansir, having heard of his talents  for poetry, sent for him and invited him to Cordova, imagining that he would  eclipse the fame of the celebrated poet Abi ’Alf Al-k4lf, who, as before related,  came from Baghddd during the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn An-ndsir. ‘‘ But Al-  “‘ manstr,” continues Ibn Bessdm, ‘“ found nothing in Sé’id to justify the high  “opinion which he had formed of him; and, moreover, the learned men of  ‘* Cordova became his enemies, and spoke in the worst possible terms of him,  “‘ of his learning, understanding, and religion. They called him a liar and an  ‘‘ impostor, and they would neither receive traditional information of any sort  ‘“‘ from him, nor give credit to his words. When he composed his Fosstss (the",238,book_7,
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 201    “ book of gems), they criticised the work, and threw it, out of contempt, into the  “river.” It is true that, if we are to believe the authors of that time, Sd’id  was more remarkable for his quickness at repartee, and his facility in composing  verses extempore, than either for his learning or his veracity, as the following  anecdote will show. One day as Al-manstr was sitting in his hall surrounded  by the highest functionaries of his court and empire, and by all the men of his  court eminent for their learning, as Az-zubeydi (Abi Bekr Mohammed), Al-’dssemf,  Ibnu-l-’arif, and others, he said to them, ‘‘ Here is a man lately come among us  ‘* who pretends to be better informed (than any man in Cordova] in these sciences,  “and I wish to put him to the test.” He accordingly sent for him, and Abi  ’Ali came and prostrated himself before him, and was struck with awe and astonish-  ment at the numerous assembly. Al-manstir then rose from his couch, and  advancing towards him, asked him about Abu Sa’id As-sirdfi, a learned man whom  Abi ’Ali pretended to have met in his travels, and to have read under his direction  the book of Sibauyeh. Agreeably to the instructions of Al-manstr, Al-’4ssemi  began to interrogate Sa’id about that work, and to put to him several questions  respecting the science of grammar ; but Sd’id answered not a single one, alleging  as an excuse that grammar was not his favourite study: upon which Az-zubeyd{f  said to him, ‘“ Will the Sheikh let us know that in which he is most versed,  ‘that we may try his powers ?”—“‘ Philology,” * answered Sé’id. ‘‘ Very well,”  replied Az-zubeydi; ‘‘ tell us then what is the measure of aulak.” Upon which  Sa’id burst out laughing and said, “Is it to one like me that thou puttest  “such a question? Thou hadst better ask a school-boy.”—‘‘ That may be,”  said Az-zubeydi, ‘ but, such as it is, 1 am sure thou canst not answer it.” Sé’id’s  countenance suddenly changed, and he remained for some time silent; at last  he said, ‘‘ The measure of aulak is af’al.”’ 5—“ It is not,” said Az-zubeydi; ‘and  “if thy master told thee that, he told thee a most egregious lie.”—‘‘ How is that ?  “does the Sheikh find fault with my derivation? ”—‘‘ Yes, I do,” replied Az-  zubeydi. ‘‘ Well then,” said Sa’id, “‘ it is not to be wondered at, for my principal  ‘‘ strength lies in knowing verses and history by heart, in explaining enigmatic  “sentences, and in the science of music.” Sd’id was next attacked by Ibnu-l-  ’arif, who disputed some time with him: but the former came off victorious ; for  scarcely was there a word uttered in the assembly, but Sé’id immediately replied  with a quotation in verse, or with some anecdote in illustration of it,—a performance  which struck Al-manstir with amazement. He then showed him the Kitdbu-n-  nawddir, which Abd ’Ali Al-k4lf wrote in praise of the Beni Umeyyah, which,  being examined by Sé’id, he said to Al-manstir, “‘ If thou givest me permission,  “I will compose a book in thy praise that shall be more valuable than this; I  VOL. 11. 2p",239,book_7,

No  sooner had he completed it and presented it to Al-mansir, than the learned  men of Cordova, who were all anxious to see how Sd’id had treated the subject,  immediately procured copies of it. What was their astonishment to find upon  perusal that not one word or quotation in the book was true, and that no story  (of those mentioned] could be traced to a source known to them! They therefore  agreed unanimously to expose Sé’id’s impudence, and make his ignorance public  to the world. They requested Al-mansir to have some quires of white paper  bound together, so as to present the appearance of a written volume, with the  following title, Kitdbu-n-nekat (the book of lies) ; its author Abi-l-ghauth, of San’4.  The book was then placed in a spot where Sé’id might see it when he entered  the hall. The stratagem succeeded completely: no sooner had Sd’id cast his  eyes on the volume than he exclaimed, ‘‘ 1 know this work well; I read it in such  ‘a country, under the direction of such a Sheikh.” Al-mansiir then took the  volume into his hands, for fear that Sé’id should open it and find out the  stratagem, and said to him, ‘‘ Well, then, since thou hast read it, tell us of its  ‘* contents.”—‘ It is so long since I perused it, that I am afraid I do not recollect  ‘any portion of it, however small; but this I can say, that it is composed of  ‘“‘ detached pieces without either poetry or anecdotes.”—‘* Leave my presence  ‘* immediately,” said Al-mansir; ‘‘ I never saw a greater liar than thou. May  ‘God free me from men of thy stamp!” He then commanded that Sa’id should  be sent out of the room, and his book thrown into the river, as was done.   It was in allusion to this occurrence that one of the poets of Cordova said—   “* The book of the gems is now engulphed in the river; may all bad books  ‘* meet with a similar fate !””   To which Sé4’id replied in the following verse :   ‘The gems have returned to their mines, for in the bottom of the sea the  “‘ gems are found.” ©   Ibn Khallekdn relates that Al-mansir had given Sé’id five thousand dinars’ for  the composition of that work.   With all Sdé’id’s impudence, and his utter disregard of those qualities which  ought to ornament a good poet, he nevertheless was at times extremely happy in  his ideas, and no other poet of his time surpassed him in facility of extempore  composition. The author of the Beddya’-l-bedéyat (admirable beginnings) ® relates  that Sd’id once attended a drinking-party at the house of one of his friends. When  it came to his turn to drink, the page who poured out the wine filled Sd’id’s cup  out of a jar which he held in his hand. One of the company observing at the",240,book_7,
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 203    mouth of the jar a drop of wine, which remained fixed to it, begged Sé’id to  describe it in verse; and he said, without the least hesitation,—  ‘* When the fragrancy of the garden reaches us, it puts us in mind of the  “ sweet-smelling musk :  ‘So does this jar of ours, with the wine in its mouth; it reminds us of a  “ bird carrying a ruby in its bill.” 9  Among the extraordinary anecdotes related of S4’id, the following is one. Upon  one occasion, as Al-mansir was sitting in his hall, a man came in and presented  him with a beautiful rose-bud out of season; upon which Sé’id, who was in the  room at the time, said extempore these two verses: .  “QO Abi ’A’mir! the rose just presented to thee will put thee in mind of  “ sweet-smelling musk.  ‘« See how it hides its head within its calyx, as the timid virgin [hides her  ‘* face behind her veil] to avoid the look of a stranger.” '°  Al-manstr was delighted with these verses; but Ibnu-l-’arif, who was also in  the room, and hated Sd’id most intensely, and was always endeavouring to do him  all the harm possible, went up to Al-manstr and said to him, ‘‘ Those two verses  “are not the composition of Sé’id. I have seen them attributed to a poet of  ‘« Baghdd4d who resided in Cairo; and, what is more, I have them at home on  “the fiy-leaf of a book, and in the handwriting of the author himself.” Al-  mansir having expressed a wish to see them, Ibnu-l-’arif"" left the room, mounted  a horse, and hastened to the dwelling of a poet named Ibn Bedr, one of the quickest  men of his time in composing poetry. Having told him his adventure, he requested  him to write a poem in which he might intercalate the two verses delivered by  Sa’id. Ibn Bedr, who, like most of the Cordovan poets, was exceedingly envious  of S4’id, immediately complied with his request, and gave him the following lines,  which he hastened to produce before Al-mansir :  ‘« I went one night to the palace of ’Abbdsah, when sleep had overpowered  “ her guards.  “T found her reclining on her nuptial couch, her energies prostrated by the  ‘* intoxicating liquor.  “* She said, ‘ Art thou come to me at the first sleep?’ I answered, ‘ Nay,’  ‘* and she threw down her cup.  “ And she stretched her hand to a rose, the odour of which thou mightest  “* compare to sweet-smelling musk ;  “A rose hiding its head within its calyx, as the timid virgin [hides her  “* face behind her veil] to avoid the look of a stranger. :  “ She then said, ‘ Fear God, and do not insult thy cousin ’Abbdsah.’",241,book_7,
"    204 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [sooK vir,    ‘« And, turning away from her, I retired carelessly, leaving her disappointed  ‘and myself too.”   Tbnu-l-’arif took the verses and pasted them on the back of a book written in  the Egyptian hand, with the capitals and heads of chapters in red ink; he  hastened with it to the presence of Al-mansir, who was waiting with the greatest  impatience. No sooner had he perused the verses than his indignation was roused  to the highest pitch, and he exclaimed, ‘‘ To-morrow we will summon Sd’id to  “our presence; and, unless he gives us a satisfactory answer to this charge, he  “‘ shall be banished the country.” On the ensuing morning Al-mansir sent for  Sé’id, who, in obedience to his summons, hastened to the palace. He found  Al-mansir’s hall thronged with courtiers and other persons who had been ex-  pressly invited for the occasion. In the middle of the hall a large tray,’® con-  taining compartments ornamented with every variety of elegant design, had been  placed by order of Al-mansir. On the roof of the compartments were toys of  jasmine made in imitation of females, and under the roof a reservoir of transparent  water, the bottom of which was paved with pearls instead of common pebbles ;  in the water was a snake swimming. When Saé’id entered the hall and had  seen all these curiosities, Al-mansir said to him, “‘ This day thou must either  “‘ rejoice and be happy with us, or else thou must be miserable whilst we are  ‘* rejoicing. There are people in this room who pretend that none of the verses  “thou recitest are thy own composition, and certainly we have a proof that  “this is true with regard to some. Look at that tray, the like of which, I  ‘assert, was never placed before any other king but me.” He then proceeded  to enumerate every one of the curiosities that were on it, and continued: “ If the  ‘“‘ charge brought against thee be false, prove it by describing to me in verse both  “ the tray and its contents.” S4’id immediately said—   “O Abi ’A’mir! are not thy benefits always flowing, and thy enemies on  “earth always fearing?   “ [And why should they not] when the age brings thee every novelty, and  ‘« presents thee with more wonders than can [easily] be described ?   ‘* Here are the flowers which a fertilizing shower engendered, and the stocks  “« of which are covered with fringes of yellow and bright green ;   “Which, to complete their beauty, have female slaves standing opposite .  ‘* [to them) with a variety of musical instruments in their hands ;   “* Seeking shelter under the roofs of jasmine, as the gazelle looks for a  ‘‘ shadowy spot [among the trees].   ‘« But that most to be wondered at is, that the maids are looking over a  “ lake enfolding every beauty ;",242,book_7,

Al-manstir was exceedingly pleased with the verses, which he  immediately wrote down himself, for fear he should forget them. There was,  however, among the curiosities in the tray, one which S4’id had not noticed ; it  was a ship, in which was a maiden rowing herself with oars of gold. Al-mansir  therefore said to him, ‘‘ Very well, S4’id; I am pleased with thy verses, only thou  “ hast forgotten to mention the ship with the maid inside.” Upon which Sé’id  said immediately—   “‘ But what is most to be admired is the crowned maiden in the vessel,  ‘‘ whose beauty no tongue can describe.  “ Tf the waves rock her vessel, she fears for her anchor, and dreads the high  “‘ winds, precursors [of the storm].  “ Beauty itself is the pilot of this vessel; holding in her right hand the oar  to direct her with.  ‘* Certainly we never saw before this a palm-grove despoil itself of its trees  “ to place them in the hands of maidens.  ‘‘No wonder if the upper regions (of thy throne] surpass a garden [in  “‘ verdure], and are spread with glittering gold and myriads of flowers.  “ For thou art a man who has no sooner formed a wish than the necks  “are stretched out [to accomplish it]; and benevolence itself trembles for  “fear of thy displeasure.  ‘If I utter a sentence or pronounce an extempore speech, what else is  “it for, but to sing thy praises?” '®   So pleased was Al-manstir.with the above two compositions, that he ordered  to be given to S4’id one thousand dinars and one hundred dresses ; he assigned  him, besides, a pension of thirty gold dinars per month on his treasury, and made  him one of his common guests. We have already said that S4’id was celebrated  above all things for his quickness and facility for inventing lies. Al-mansir having  once asked him what the khanboshdr was, he answered immediately, ‘‘ The khan-  “ boshdr is a plant which the Arabs of the desert use for thickening their milk.  “ In allusion to it an ancient poet has said—   ‘ The love of her lies as heavily on my heart, as the khanboshér adheres  ‘to the new milk.’” '®  We might multiply the examples of the astonishing facility with which Sé’id",243,book_7,

Having upon one occasion presented Al-manstr with a live stag, he wrote by  the bearer an elegant kassidah, of which the following detached verses are an  extract :   “O refuge of the terrified, asylum of the persecuted, comfort to the  “« vilified !  * * * * * * * *  ‘* O string of virtues, and repository of every brilliant quality! thou art the  refuge of the needy.  * * * * * * * *  ‘* A slave [of thine], whom thou didst take by the hand, and didst raise  from his station, presents thee with a stag.  “T named it Garsiah, and I send it to thee [with a rope round its neck],  “ that the same may happen with its namesake (the Christian king].  “ Shouldst thou accept (this my present], I would consider it as the greatest  ‘* favour that a generous man can bestow.” !”   Now it happened, in conformity with the decrees of the Almighty, that on the  very day in which Sa’id presented the stag to Al-manstir and named it Garsiah  (Garcia), as a good omen, the Christian king of that name (Garci-Fernandez, Count  of Castile) was taken prisoner by the Moslems. As Garsiah was one day hunting,  he fell in with a party of Al-manstr’s cavalry, who surrounded him, made him  prisoner with all his suite, and conveyed him.to Cordova. Al-mansir was so  much struck by that coincidence of fate, and moreover was so much pleased with  SWid’s verses, that he granted him a greater share of his favour than he had ever  possessed before, and from that day always defended him against the accusations of  his enemies. As a proof of the great favour which Sa’id enjoyed with Al-mansir,  we shall here transcribe an anecdote borrowed from a history of that H4jib, entitled  Al-azhdru-l-manthirah ft-l-akhbdri-l-mdthirah (scattered flowers, or the memorable  deeds of Ibn Abi ’A’mir). At the twenty-eighth flower (or chapter) of that work  we read as follows: ‘“‘ One day Sa’id collected together all the rags and tatters  “‘ of the dresses which Al-mansir had at different times given him, and having  “ sent for his black slave Kaéfir, he directed him to have a shirt made of them,  ‘‘as if it were patch-work.'® When the shirt was made to fit him, says S4’id,  “ T bade Kafr accompany me one morning to the palace of Al-mansir at an early  “hour. Having been introduced to his presence, I remained with him some time,  “until, seeing him in good humour, I said to him, ‘My Lord! thy slave has a    “    “",244,book_7,
"    CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 207    ‘“‘ request to make.’—‘ State it,’ answered Al-mansir. ‘I wish for permission  “‘to introduce here my slave Kéfir.’—‘ Is it to be now immediately?’ replied  “ Al-manstr, and he added, ‘ hast thou nothing more to ask for? ’—‘ No, I have  “no other request to make, except that he be admitted to thy presence.’—‘ Well,  ‘* Jet it be so,’ said Al-mansiir ; and he accordingly ordered his guards to introduce  “« the black slave into the room. Soon after Kéftir made his appearance, accoutred,  “as before stated, in a shirt made of patch-work. He being as tall and supple as  “a young palm-tree, the sight was exceedingly ludicrous. Seeing him enter the  ‘‘ room, Al-mansiir said, ‘ Here comes the master of beauty and the king of rags.  ‘* Pray what is the meaning of all this?’ Upon which I answered, ‘ Let the sight  “‘ of my slave be my answer, and know, O my Lord, that thou gavest me this day  “the skin of Kafir full of money.’ Al-mansiir smiled, and said, ‘May God  “ prosper those [who like thee] plunge into the depths of enigmatic speech to  “return thanks for a favour!’ After which he ordered me a considerable sum  ‘* of money and a handsome dress, and gave also a very fine dress to Kéfir.”   But since we have touched upon the history of Al-manstir, we will not. proceed  any further without transcribing for the use of our readers the most remarkable  anecdotes of his generosity, worldly wisdom, courage, and justice.   The story of Mohammed, the bleeder of Al-manstir :—   Al-mansir, desiring once to be bled, sent for his bleeder, Mohammed, who was at  the same time his servant and his confidant. The messenger repaired immediately  to the dwelling of Mohammed; but not finding him at home, he ascertained upon  inquiry that he had just been confined in prison, on a sentence of the Kadi  Mohammed Ibn Rib, before whom he had been convicted of ill-using his wife ;  as he thought that his favour with Al-mansir would save him from the punishment  he deserved. The messenger then returned, and apprised Al-mansir of the cir-  cumstance, who ordered that the bleeder should be released and brought to his  presence, under the custody of one of the guards of the prison, and that, after  performing the operation, he should again return to prison. His orders were  punctually executed. Mohammed was brought to his presence, and after bleeding  his master, as desired, was again marched out to prison. They say that as he was  going out of the room, the bleeder began to expostulate; but Al-mansir stopping  him short, said to him, ‘‘No, Mohammed! he is the judge, and, if he be right  “in his judgment, it is not in our power to resist his authority or oppose his  “* sentence: thou art now entirely in his power.” Mohammed returned accordingly  to his prison; but, soon after, the Kadi, hearing of the circumstance, managed a  reconciliation between him and his wife, and he was set at liberty in consequence.   The following anecdote has been preserved on the authority of Sho’alah. I said    Anecdotes   respecting Al-  manstr.—His  love of justice.    His attention  to business.",245,book_7,
"    208 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vit.    one night to Al-manstir, perceiving that he was watching, ‘‘I am afraid that  “« our lord sits up too much at night, and that his body wants more sleep and rest  ‘* than is allowed to it; and yet no one is better acquainted than he is with the  “ill effects produced by want of proper rest upon the nerves.” He replied,  “O Sho’alah, kings should never sleep whilst their subjects are at rest; for if  ‘IT were to have my full sleep, there would be in the whole of this metropolis  ‘* nothing but sleepers.”   In illustration of this, an Andalusian writer has preserved the following anecdote.  Al-manstir was one night sitting [in his audience-room] ; it was a dreadful night,  the rain came down in torrents, the wind was high, and it was piercing cold  besides. . All of a sudden, Al-mansir sent for one of the horsemen of his guard,  and said to him, ‘Go down to Fej-Talydresh (Tallares) and stop there until  “‘ thou seest a person pass; seize him, whoever he may be, and bring him hither  ‘“‘ instantly.” The horseman did as he was commanded; he rode to the spot  which had been pointed out to him, and waited there nearly all night on his horse  in the midst of the cold, rain, and wind, without seeing a.single creature whom he  might seize and convey to his master, as he had been directed. At last, a little  before the dawn of day, and just as the horseman was thinking whether he should  not return to the palace and report the non-success of his expedition, a very old  man, bent by age, made his appearance, mounted on an ass, and having an axe  by his side. ‘‘ Where art thou going to, my good old man?” said the soldier  to him. ‘I am going to the forest to cut some wood.” Surely, thought the  soldier to himself, this cannot be the man whom Al-mansir wishes to see; he  is only a wood-cutter going to cut some wood, I shall let him go. He therefore  allowed him to pass on; but scarcely had the old man gone a little way, than  the soldier recollected Al-manstr’s order, and dreading his vengeance, rode up  to him, and desired him to turn round, and go with him to the presence of Al-  mansir. ‘‘ And what can Al-manstir want with a poor old man like myself?  “Pray let me go, and do not hinder me from earning my livelihood. I entreat  ‘“‘ thee, in the name of Allah, not to detain me.”—‘ I cannot grant thy request,”  replied the soldier ; ‘‘ my master’s orders must needs be obeyed; thou must come  “along with me.” The soldier and his prisoner then proceeded together to the  palace, and were immediately introduced to the presence of Al-manstir, whom they  found sitting in his hall, where he had been waiting all night, without retiring to  rest. No sooner had he cast his eyes on the old man, than he said to the Sclavonians  of his guard, ‘‘ Search him!” The person of the old man was accordingly searched,  but nothing was found on him. ‘‘ Search then the pack-saddle of his ass,”  said Al-mansir impatiently. This was done as he commanded; when, behold!",246,book_7,
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 209    there was found concealed in the lining a letter from certain Christians, who  were then employed in his service, to their friends, engaging them to make an  incursion into the Moslem territory, and attack certain districts that were not  well defended. The ensuing day an order came down from Al-mansir for the  arrest of the guilty parties, who, together with the bearer of their message, were  by his orders taken outside the gate of Az-zdhirah, and there beheaded.   An eastern merchant, who traded in jewels, once came to Cordova from ’Aden,  a city in Arabia. Having repaired to Az-zahirah, where Al-manstr was residing  at the time, he asked leave to see him, and, being admitted to his presence, he  forthwith proceeded to display before him all sorts of precious stones, of great  value, which he had with him. Al-manstr having taken those which he liked  the most, caused the price of the jewels to be paid to the merchant, who, leaving  his presence, returned by the same road he had come, taking with him the money  which he had just received and which he stored in a bag made of a certain stuff  manufactured in Yemen for fine carpets. The road which the merchant had to  traverse was a sandy plain, stretching along the banks of the river: the day was  a hot one, and the sun was high, so that, after travelling some distance, he felt  an inclination to bathe in the river. He accordingly took off his clothes, and,  having placed his bag of money upon them, jumped into the water. Scarcely,  however, had he been in a few minutes, when a kite alighted on the clothes, and  taking the bag for a piece of meat, seized it in its bill and flew away with its prey.  For some time the merchant eagerly followed the thieving bird with his eyes;  but, at last, it disappeared entirely, leaving him in the greatest possible agony  of mind. Seeing, however, that his misfortune had no remedy, he put on his  clothes and went to his dwelling, where the loss which he had just sustained  so much preyed upon his mind as to occasion him a severe illness, through which  he well-nigh lost his life. Upon his recovery the merchant went to see Al-manstr  a second time for the purpose of showing him other jewels ; but he was so altered  in his appearance, and the gloom and sorrow upon his countenance were such,  that the Hajib could not but be struck by .it, and he accordingly inquired what  had happened to him; upon which the merchant related to him his adventure.  ‘Why didst thou not come to us before? we might perchance have told thee  “of a plan to recover thy money or find out the thief. Which way did the kite  “fly?” The merchant answered, “It flew eastwards in the direction of this  “ mountain, close to thy palace,” meaning the sandy plain. Immediately upon  learning this, Al-manstr sent for one of his body-guard, and said to him, ‘‘ Let  ‘all the old men who live in yonder plain repair immediately hither.” His orders  being punctually executed, there soon came before him several respectable old   VOL. 1. 25",247,book_7,
"    210 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vil.    men, who were the heads of so many families. He then directed them to make  inquiries whether any of the people of the neighbourhood had been observed  suddenly to pass from poverty to affluence, without any well-known cause. The  old men did as they were ordered, and, after investigating the case, returned to  Al-mansir, and said to him, ‘‘ We only know of one man in our neighbourhood  “‘ who was exceedingly poor some time since [and whose condition is now changed].  “He used to support himself and family entirely by the work of his hands, and  ‘he and his sons always went on foot [or carried their own loads] for want  “‘of a beast. We hear that this very day he has bought a nag for himself, besides  “a complete suit of the best materials for each of his sons.” Upon this, Al-mansir  gave orders that the man alluded to should be brought into his presence the next  morning, bidding the merchant to be also ready to appear before him at the  appointed hour. When morning came, the man presented himself to Al-mansir,  who, upon his entering the room, went straight to him, and in the merchant’s  presence addressed him thus: ‘If any thing which we have lost should have  “fallen into thy hands, what wouldst thou do with it?” Upon which the  man replied instantly, ‘‘ Here it is, my Lord,” and putting his hand into his  trowsers’ pocket, he took out the very bag which the merchant had lost. At  sight of his lost treasure the merchant shouted with delight, and his joy was so  great that he actually jumped. Al-manstir then ordered the man to explain  how the circumstance had happened, and he said, ‘“‘As I was working in my  “‘ orchard under a palm-tree, I saw something drop down a few yards before me.  “‘T picked it up, and to my great surprise and delight found it to be a handsome  “bag full of money. When I saw it, I thought to myself, I would swear this  ‘* money belongs to our master, Al-mansir, and that some bird has stolen it from  ‘“‘his castle and dropped it in his flight in this neighbourhood. I then opened  “the bag, and examined its contents; when my extreme poverty tempted me  “to take ten gold dinars out of the many which it contained, all the time  “‘ saying to myself, I have no doubt that when my lord Al-mansir, who is so  ‘* generous, hears of the circumstance, he will not hesitate to give them to me.”  Great was Al-mansir’s surprise when he heard the poor man’s story. Having  taken the bag from him, he handed it over to the merchant, saying, ‘‘ Take thy bag  ‘‘and count the money; whatever is wanting, thou wilt charge to my account.”  The merchant did as he was desired, and, having counted his money, said, ‘‘ By  “‘ the merits of thy head! there is nothing wanting but the few dinars he has told  “us of, and those I willingly give up to him from this moment.” ‘ No,” replied  Al-mansiir, ‘the priority in this case belongs by right to us, and it is for us  “to reward the man [as he deserves]; we will take nothing from thy joy, it",248,book_7,
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 211    “must be complete.” Saying this, he caused ten dindérs to be given to the  merchant instead of the ten wanting, and rewarded the gardener with ten more for  his having had the virtue not to appropriate to himself the whole of the sum that  fell into his hands. He then said, ‘ Had he confessed [his guilt] before we came  ‘to inquire into it, his reward would have been complete.”” The merchant then  began to praise Al-manstr, and finding his spirits returned, he exclaimed, “ By  ‘* Allah! the fame of this deed of thine shall travel the regions of the world ; it shall  “be said of thee that thou exercisest over the birds of the air the same power  ‘‘ which thou hast over the inhabitants of the land in these thy dominions ; there  “is no escaping thy will or avoiding thy power.’’ Al-manstr smiled, and said,  “« Be moderate in thy expressions, and may God pardon thee!” The assembly  then withdrew in utter amazement of Al-manstr’s sagacity in discovering the  lost treasure, his readiness to allay the merchant’s grief, and the benevolence and  forbearance he displayed in the midst of his power.   It is related by Abi Bekr At-tortishi (from Tortosa),” who held it from Abi-l-  walid Al-b4ji, that as Al-manstr was once about to cross the frontier and penetrate  into the enemy’s territory, he ascended to the summit of a hill for the purpose  of reconnoitring the neighbouring country. Once at the top, he looked down  and saw his troops encamped in the middle of an extensive plain stretching both  right and left. Having for a while considered the imposing sight in silence, he  turned towards the Mukaddam™ (leader of the van) of his army, whose name was  Tbnu-l-mus‘hafi, and said to him, ‘‘ What is thy opinion of an army like that?”  —‘‘ My opinion is,” answered Ibnu-l-mushafi, ‘that it is a well-disciplined and  “ numerous army.”—‘ I should not be astonished,” replied Al-mansir, ‘“ if there  ‘* were in an army of that sort one thousand warriors of undaunted courage, and  ‘“‘ matchless dexterity in the handling of weapons, capable, in short, of meeting  “‘ hand to hand the stoutest champion of the Christians.” Ibnu-l-mus‘hafi made  no reply to the above observation, and kept silence. ‘‘ Why answerest thou not?”  said Al-mansir to him. ‘Is there not in my army the number and description  ‘of warriors that I have just named ?”—“ Certainly there is not,” was the  officer’s reply. Al-manstir was greatly startled by the answer; yet he said almost  immediately, ‘‘ If there be not that number, at least thou wilt grant that there  “ are five hundred.”—‘‘ Not even that number,” replied Ibnu-l-mus/hafi. Hearing  this, Al-manstir could hardly suppress his anger. ‘‘ Wilt thou not grant me one  “ hundred ? ”»—‘* Not even fifty,” answered Ibnu-l-mus‘hafi, with the greatest  coolness.—Al-mansiir’s indignation could no longer be controlled; he foamed at  the mouth with rage, he abused Ibnu-l-mus‘hafi, called him an infidel, a traitor,  and a coward, and bade him leave his presence immediately, if he valued his head.",249,book_7,
"    212 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vil.    Some time after this occurrence a Christian army made its appearance on the  plain where the Moslems were encamped, and as Al-mansir never refused battle  whenever it was offered to him by the enemy, he marshalled his troops, and made  every preparation for the forthcoming engagement. The Christians, on the other  hand, did the same; and the two hosts, having well chosen their ground, divided  the extensive plain between them. The two armies were already drawn in line  of battle, and the warriors of both nations were waiting only for the signal of  their respective commanders to rush upon each other, when, behold! a Christian  knight, cased in bright steel, came out from the ranks, and, advancing between  the two hosts, began to prance his horse and to brandish his spear, challenging  the Moslem warriors to single combat. ‘‘Is there any of you,” said he, with a  terrific voice which resounded through the plain, “‘ who dares to come out?”  Presently a Moslem champion sallied out; but, after a few blows were exchanged, he  was unhorsed and slain. Great was the joy of the infidel dogs when they saw  the Christian knight slay his adversary ; their deafening shouts resounded through  the air like claps of terrific thunder, whilst the Moslems were dejected and afflicted  at the death of their comrade. Elated with success, the Christian knight again  rode his steed between the two hosts, and said, ‘Is there no one to come out  ‘“‘ and fight me? If your brave men dare not come alone, let two of them, three  “more come out,—I will fight them all.” Hearing this taunting bravado, another  Moslem left the ranks; but alas! he shared the same fate with his companion.  “Let three to one come out,” cried the Christian with exultation, ‘‘ one is not  “enough for me.” A Moslem warrior then presented himself, but he was  immediately dispatched like the two preceding ones. Again the infidels rent  the air with their exclamations of joy, whilst the Moslems were afflicted and in  dismay: a sort of panic fear ran throughout the whole army, which, there can  be no doubt, would have been easily defeated, had the Christians then commenced  the attack. Meanwhile Al-mansir was mad with rage, pacing the ground with  the greatest inquietude, and not knowing what to do to inspire courage into his  dispirited troops. At last he sent for Ibnu-l-mus‘hafi, and said to him, ‘‘ Hast  “thou seen the feats of arms performed by yonder Christian dog ?”—“ I have,”  answered Ibnu-l-mus‘hafi, ‘‘I watched attentively all his movements.”—‘ And  ‘‘ what is thy advice on this occasion ?”—‘ Explain thy wishes to me,” said  Al-mushafi, ‘‘ and I will counsel thee to the best of my understanding.”—“ I wish  ‘to humble the pride of the Christian, and put a stop to his insulting bravadoes.”  “That can only be attained,” said Ibnu-l-mus‘hafi, ‘‘ by finding a Moslem who  ‘‘ will be his superior in courage, strength, and dexterity ; but I will see to that.”  Without loss of time Ibnu-l-mus‘hafi galloped off to a division of the army where    ",250,book_7,
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 213    he knew of some warriors renowned for their former exploits, and, having communi-  cated to them the wishes of their general, a young man belonging to the troops  of the Thagher came forwards mounted on a lean, sorry nag, extremely weak about  its hind-quarters, having before his saddle a water-skin; the rest of his apparel    was equally poor and ludicrous. ‘‘ Well, my brave youth,” said Ibnu-l-mus‘hafi to  him, ‘“didst thou see the Christian slay thy comrades ?”—‘ I did,” replied the  young soldier, ‘‘ and what are thy wishes ?”—‘‘ I want thee to bring me his head.”    The youth departed with his water-skin and his sorry nag, and arrived before  the Christian, whom he attacked immediately. Scarcely a few minutes had elapsed,  when the Moslem soldier was observed galloping back to his ranks with some-  thing in his hand, which, at his approach, proved to be the gory head of the  Christian knight. Having laid his trophy at the feet of Al-manstir, he was  immediately promoted, and rewarded besides with a very large sum of money.  Tbnu-l-mus‘hafi then observed to Al-manstr, ‘‘ Was I not right when I told thee  ‘that there were not one thousand warriors, nor five hundred, nor one hundred,  ‘nor fifty, nor twenty, nor ten even? The event has proved it. This youth is  “one of the very few who can pass under that denomination.” Al-mansir  restored Ibnu-l-mushafi to his favour, and from that day listened more attentively  to his advice.   One of Al-manstir’s soldiers once left his banner [fixed in the earth] on a  mountain close to a Christian town. After the retreat of the Moslem army, the  Christians of the town, seeing the banner fluttering before the wind on the top  of the mountain, felt desirous to get possession of it; but not knowing what troops  there might be behind it, they dared not for several days- quit the town. Let  this be an example of the awe in which the worshippers of the Trinity stood  in those glorious times of the servants of the only God; for it is a fact that  whenever the proudest kings of the Christians met [in the field] Al-manstir’s  invincible host, fear lodged in their hearts; and being convinced that resistance  in the open field was of no avail, they invariably took to flight and sought refuge  behind the walls of their towns and castles, from which they never moved, but  watched from the top the movements of their enemies.   In one of his campaigns to the land of the Franks, Al-mansir happened to  pass between two lofty mountains by a narrow road or defile which led into the  heart of the enemy’s territory. No sooner had he crossed the pass, than he began,  as usual, to make incursions into the neighbouring districts, wasting and burning  every thing that lay in his way, and making prisoners right and left. As the  Franks made no resistance, Al-mansir pushed his ravages further into their country  for several consecutive days, until, being satisfied with the plunder which he had",251,book_7,
"    214 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vil.    collected, he thought of returning by the same road he had come. On his  arrival at the narrow pass he found it strongly guarded by the Christians, who  had assembled in great numbers to oppose his passage. When Al-manstr saw the  Christians in possession of the pass, he was not the least disconcerted ; he returned  with his host to the country which he had lately traversed, and having chosen  a suitable encampment for his army, set about constructing houses and dwellings for  his soldiers, as it was then winter-time. This being done, he ordered his men to  provide themselves with agricultural implements, and directed them to plough  and sow the neighbouring fields. At the same time he sent marauding parties  to plunder the country around, and make prisoners, who, when brought to the  camp, were immediately beheaded, with the exception of the children, who were  preserved [to be brought up in the Mohammedan faith]. The carcasses of the slain  were then, by his orders, thrown at the mouth of the pass; their number being  so great that the pass was actually blocked up with them, and that for several  miles round the country became a complete desert. In the mean while the  Christians sent a message to Al-mansir, offering to let him pass unmolested  with his army, if he would give up all his plunder and captives; but this Al-man-  str most indignantly refused: upon which the infidels sent him a second message,  offering to let him pass with both plunder and captives; but Al-mansir answered,  ‘‘My men are no longer desirous to cross, but wish to remain where they are.  “‘ Were they to cross the pass and return [to Cordova], they would soon have to  “recross it for the ensuing spring campaign. We are therefore determined to  ‘* stop here till next year, and when we have gone through our campaign then  ‘« will we cross the pass, and not before.” However, the Franks kept importuning  him until he granted them the peace they implored, on condition that they would  furnish him with mules to carry his plunder and his captives, and would besides  supply him with provisions for his army up to the time of his arrival in his  own territory; and, moreover, that they should themselves remove the carcasses  of their countrymen heaped up before the mouth of the pass ; all which conditions  the Christians faithfully fulfilled, Al-mansiir and his army passing unmolested  through the pass. ‘ By my life,” observes the historian from whom the above  narrative is borrowed, ‘there never was recorded a more splendid deed than this,  ‘‘or a case in which divine assistance was made more manifest; for causing  ‘the proud enemies of Islam to remove the putrid carcasses of their slaughtered  ‘* countrymen is an exploit unprecedented in the annals of warfare.”   Among the remarkable acts recorded of Al-mansiir, and which are not told of  any other prince, one is, that his army was chiefly composed of [Christian] captives  taken in his wars with the infidels. It is a well-authenticated fact, corroborated",252,book_7,
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 215    by the testimony of contemporary historians. That with such troops Al-mansir  should have been enabled to accomplish what he did, and to defeat, wherever he  met them, the best-appointed armies of the Christians, is only one proof more of  the favours and assistance which the Almighty was pleased to dispense to him.   The above extracts are from the work of Ibnu Hayydn; we shall now transcribe  from the Ashdru-l-manthirah ft-l-akhbdrt-l-mdthirah before mentioned. It is there  said, in the twenty-ninth flower or chapter, that ‘‘As Al-manstir was one day  “« sitting under a tent in the plain outside of Cordova to pass in review his infantry  “and cavalry, and see them manceuvre,” the reviewing field being filled with  ** spectators, a soldier belonging to the African corps, and whose name was Watir-  “‘mér Ibn Abi Bekr Al-birzdli,2 came up before him, and addressed him in  “ language ludicrous enough to provoke to laughter a man who has just lost his  “friend or his son. ‘O my Lord!’ said he, ‘ neither I nor you have a dwelling,  “and I am actually in the street.‘ What then is become of thy spacious and  ** comfortable dwelling, O Watirmér!’ replied Al-manstir to him. ‘Thou hast  ‘* expelled me from it. May God show thee his favours! Thou gavest me fields  “and lands yielding enough produce to fill my house; but then thou didst expel  “‘ me from it, and I am now but an hungry Berber, untrained to adversity. Dost  ‘“‘ thou not see that I am like the thirsty camel who is brought to a spring,  ‘“and whose head is yet held up so that he cannot drink?’ Hearing this  ‘ incoherent speech, Al-manstir burst out laughing and said, ‘May God preserve  “‘ thee from the shafts of calamity! Thy manner of returning thanks for a benefit  ‘* is more pleasing to our ears and more gratifying to our hearts than the eloquent  ‘“‘ and learned perorations of other men.’ Then turning round to the Andalusian  “© officers who were close to him, he said, ‘ Friends, if you ever have to thank  “‘ for a benefit, or to ask for the continuance of a favour, do it in this poor man’s  “ style, with the simplicity of nature, and without either strain or affectation.’™*  ‘“‘ He then gave orders that among the houses then unoccupied the best should  “‘be put at the disposal of the Berber, which was done in compliance with his  ** commands.”   In the ensuing flower, which is the thirtieth, ‘‘ Al-manstir got up one Sunday  “‘ morning, when the weather was boisterous, the wind very high, and the rain  ‘* fell in torrents. It must be observed that Sunday ™ was a day of rest for the  ‘servants [of Al-manstir’s household], who were always allowed on that day  “some relaxation from their duties; so that both circumstances united made  ‘* Al-manstir think that he would have no applications made to him, and he  “ exclaimed, ‘I should think that this day we shall be free from importuners and  ‘* pretenders! By my life, were one of them to make his appearance in spite",253,book_7,
"    216 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vil.    of the raging elements, I swear that he will carry off the first prize.’ Thus  saying, he left his room, and went to meet his Hajib (chamberlain), to whom  ‘“‘ he imparted his determination. Scarcely, however, had Al-mansir retired to  his inner apartments, when the chamberlain appeared before him, and with  a smile on his countenance said, ‘My Lord! three Berbers, Abi-n-ndss Ibn  Séleh and two more with him, are now at thy door [asking for admission].  They are dripping wet, and desirous to see thee.’—‘ Bring them in to me,’  was Al-mansir’s answer. The chamberlain hastened to execute his master’s  orders, and after a little time returned with the three Berbers, who were as  “wet as a piece of melting salt. Al-manstr laughed to see them in that plight,  and, bidding them to sit down, he inquired from them what had brought them  to his palace in such weather, when all men of sense remained quiet at home,  “and even the birds of the air took refuge within their nests. Abv-n-ndss then,  answering for his friends, said, ‘O our Lord! it is not every tradesman who sits  (waiting for customers] in his shop; there are many who, tempted by gain,  “come after us and try to deceive us, and take our mcney from us; but we  ‘« disappoint them by drawing tighter the strings of our purses. Nevertheless they  “« persevere in their attempt, and wander through the streets, markets, and squares,  “actually wearing out their shoes and garments for the sake of gain. In a like  “‘ manner do we wear out thy clothes upon the backs of our horses in an attempt  “to deserve thy favours. -We therefore thought of coming to sit down in  “this market [to see what we might get].’ Hearing this, Al-mansir laughed  ‘most heartily, and, having sent for robes and other presents, he distributed  “them among the Berbers, who returned to their dwelling highly rejoiced and  “ content with their morning’s work.” :   In the forty-fourth flower we read as follows: ‘‘ There was in Cordova during  “‘ the administration of the Hajib Al-mansir (Mohammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir) a youth  “‘ who followed the pursuits of literature, in which he had attained considerable  eminence. He occupied his time in reading books on the science of govern-  ment, and frequented the libraries for that purpose, until he obtained an appoint-  ment under government, in the exercise of which he embezzled a considerable  sum of money. Being called to account, he was found to be a debtor to the  ‘‘ state in three thousand dindrs. Al-manstr, having been informed of the cir-  “‘ cumstance, summoned the delinquent to his presence, and charged him with  embezzling the public money. The youth then made a profound bow and con-  “fessed his guilt. ‘ What induced thee, young rascal, to appropriate to thyself  “ the Sultan’s money?’ The youth replied, ‘ My reason was overpowered, and the  “ temptation to breach of faith seized upon me.’—‘ By Allah! we intend to make",254,book_7,
"    CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 217    ‘an example of thee. Here! a pair of shackles and a smith for this youth, and  “‘ away with him to prison.’ He then gave particular orders to the jailer to have  “him well flogged, and to treat him with the greatest rigour. When the youth  ‘© was about to be marched out of the room, he repeated the two following verses :  ‘ Alas! alas! the punishment which awaits me is still greater than I  ‘ should have imagined.  ‘ There is no escaping my miserable fate; power and strength only belong  ‘ to God.’ *   ‘* When Al-manstir heard these verses, he said to his guards, ‘ Stay ;’ and then,  ‘ addressing himself to the youth, ‘ Hast thou any thing to say in thy defence,  “or dost thou conform thyself to thy sentence?’—‘I have,’ was the youth’s  “‘answer. The shackles were then knocked off his feet; and this being done, he  “said extempore—   ‘ Seest thou not that Al-mansir’s forgiveness must needs be followed by a  * favour ?  ‘ Like Allah, who, after forgiving his servants, admits them into Paradise.’ ”   “He was right: not only did Al-mansir set him at liberty, but he pardoned  ‘‘ him the sums which he had embezzled, and exempted him from all further  ‘* prosecution on that account.”   From the forty-fifth flower: ‘‘ Al-mansiir, feeling one day indisposed, wanted  ‘to have a cautery applied to his leg. The surgeon was sent for, and, although  ‘“‘ when he arrived, Al-manstr was sitting on a raised throne, surrounded by his  ‘* courtiers and administering justice to his subjects, he nevertheless directed the  ‘* surgeon to apply the cautery to his leg; which was done, the assembly perceiving  ‘nothing until they actually smelt the burnt flesh and skin, which caused no  “little astonishment among them.”   From the forty-sixth flower: ‘‘ Such was the awe in which Al-mansir was  “held by all those who surrounded his person, so rigorous the discipline which  ‘“he caused to be observed by the troops, and so great his care in upholding  “‘the royal dignity, that no preceding sovereign ever met with such submissive  ‘* obedience to his commands. It is said, that whenever he passed his cavalry in  “‘ review, the most profound silence was kept by the soldiers, and that the horses  “even were so trained as not to break it by their neighings. One day, as he  ‘was reviewing his troops in a plain in the vicinity: of Cordova, he happened  “to see something glitter amidst a troop of men. Having inquired what it was  “ that attracted his eyes, he was answered, that one of the soldiers had unsheathed  “his sword, thinking he could do so unperceived. ‘Bring the man to me,’  “said Al-manstr to one of his officers. The soldier accordingly came out of   VOL. Il. 2F",255,book_7,

What of his addition  to the great mosque of Cordova, which we have described elsewhere, a work so  highly meritorious in the eyes of God that it would, of itself, have procured  him a place in Paradise! What of the magnificent palaces and gilded pavilions  erected at his command, and which equalled, if they did not surpass, those con-  structed by the Sultdns of the family of Umeyyah! We have alluded elsewhere  to his having built on the banks of the Guadalquivir, at some distance from  Cordova, a strong castle, called Az-zdhirah,”* whither he conveyed all the treasures  of the state. In the course of time a beautiful palace was erected in the neigh-  bourhood, extensive gardens ” were planted ; houses, too, were built for the officers  of his household, as well as barracks for the troops of his body-guard, and Az-  zéhirah became, in a very short time, a large and populous city. Ibn Khakdén,  who alludes to it in the Mattmah, says that Al-manstir completed the building  in a.H. 387, and that in the same year, having made, as usual, an incursion  into the enemy’s territory, he caused more havoc than he had ever done, pene-  trating into the most distant and retired districts of Galicia, and collecting more  plunder than on any other former occasion.   Az-zahirah was not the only place built by Al-manstir. We are told by Al-  homaydi that he erected also, at a short distance from Cordova, and in the vicinity  of Medinatu-z-zahra, a magnificent country-residence, called Munyat Al-’Amiriyyah,  surrounded by fields and plantations, in which one thousand mudd of barley were  yearly sowed, to supply food for a stud of horses which Al-mansir kept in it.  It is related that Al-manstir was so fond of the horses reared at this place, that  on his return from a military expedition he never took any rest until he had  summoned to his presence the master of the stud, and had ascertained from  him how many colts had died during his absence, and how many were born.  In a similar manner he never failed to inquire from his chief architect whether",256,book_7,
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 219    any portion of the building required repair. At this place Al-mansiir had a  manufacture of shields and weapons, of which no less than twelve thousand were  made every year; and they say that the number of workmen employed in the  manufactory, as well as those of the stud, and other servants, was so considerable,  that no less than twelve thousand pounds of meat, exclusive of game and poultry,  were distributed to them in the course of the year. Al-mansiir erected also a  bridge on the river of Cordova (Guadalquivir), which was begun in the year 378  (beginning April 20, a.p. 988), and finished about the middle of 379 (beginning  April 10, a. p. 989), at the expense of one hundred and forty thousand dinars. It  was a very useful work, and one that will perpetuate the memory of Al-manstir. On  the subject of the building of this bridge we recollect having read somewhere a very  interesting anecdote. Among the lands which were appropriated for the building  of the bridge, there was a patch of ground belonging to an old man of the lower  classes. Al-manstr ordered the inspectors of works to purchase it from him.  Accordingly, having called upon the man, the inspectors spoke to him about his  land, explained to him the necessity under which they were of appropriating it,  as the bridge could not be erected on any other spot, and declared to him that they  had received instructions to indemnify him fully for the loss of his property. Not  wishing to part with his land, the old man asked what he considered a most  exorbitant price, imagining that when the inspectors had heard his unreasonable  demand, they would desist from their purpose; but to his great astonishment,  no sooner had he mentioned the sum, ten dinars of gold, and declared that he  would not make over his property for a lesser consideration, than the inspectors  caught him at his word, paid him the money down, and drew up a deed for the  sale. When Al-manstr was informed of the transaction, he could not help laughing  at the old man’s ignorance and imbecility; but he ordered his treasurer to pay  him ten times the money he had asked, which was done agreeably to his commands.  When the old man saw himself in possession of one hundred dinars, his joy was  extreme, and he had well-nigh lost his senses in the excess of his rejoicing. He  presented himself to Al-manstir, whom he thanked for the signal favour thus  conferred on him; and the anecdote being circulated among the people, became  the subject of history.   The above were not the only public works erected under the administration of  Al-mansir. A bridge was thrown over the river Shenil (Xenil) at Ezija, by means  of which a communication was established between that city and the neighbouring  country, the roads leading to the city were more frequented, and provisions became  more abundant. Granada, Seville, and other cities of Andalus, Ceuta and Fez in  Africa, partook alike of the benefits of Al-mansir’s administration in this respect.",257,book_7,
"    220 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Boox vil.    Among the meritorious actions of Al-mansiir, the following are particularly  recorded. He wrote with his own hand a Korén, which he always carried with  him on his military expeditions, and in which he used constantly to read. He  collected and kept all the dust which adhered to his garments during his marches  to the country of the infidels, or in his battles with them. Accordingly, whenever  he halted at a place, his servants came up to him, and carefully collected the  dust in kerchiefs, until a good-sized bag was filled, which he always carried with  him, intending to have it mixed with the perfumes for the embalming of his body.  He also took with him his grave-clothes, thus being always prepared to meet  death whenever it should assail him. The winding-sheet was made of linen grown  in the lands inherited from his father, and spun and woven by his own daughters.  He used continually to ask God to permit him to die in his service and in war  against the infidels, and this desire was granted. He became celebrated for the  purity of his intentions, the knowledge of his own sins, his fear of his Creator,  his numerous campaigns against the infidels, and many other virtues and accom-  plishments, which it would take us too long to enumerate. Whenever the name  of God was mentioned in his presence, he never failed to mention it also; and if  ever he was tempted to do an act which might deserve the chastisement of his  Lord, he invariably resisted the temptation. Notwithstanding this he enjoyed all  the pleasures of this world, which make the delight of kings, with the exception  only of wine, the use of which he left off entirely two years before he died. We  might fill whole volumes with extracts taken from those works which have been  exclusively consecrated to the history of that remarkable man ; but, however strong  the temptation, we will resist it, and will resume the thread of our long-interrupted  narrative, by recounting what happened in Cordova after the death of Al-mansir.",258,book_7,

When the sad news was divulged  {in Cordova], and the Khalif Hish4m ascertained the state in which Al-mansir lay,  he summoned to his presence a number [of civil functionaries], in order to  announce to them the fatal news; but such was the excess of his grief, that he  could not utter a single word, and he stood speechless as a ghost, endeavouring  to explain by signs to the assembly the fatal occurrence which he had te com-  municate. ’*Abdu-l-malek then returned to the camp, and found that his father  was dead, and that according to his last instructions he had been interred in the  spot where he died, namely, in his palace at Medinah Sélim (Medinaceli). The  army then broke up, the greater part going towards Hishdm [in Cordova] ; upon  which ’Abdu-l-malek, after remaining some days at Medinaceli, returned to  Cordova, accompanied by those who remained by him; and the singing women  of his father’s harem put on hair*cloth sacks and coarse blankets instead of the  silk and brocade to which they had been used.   Hishdm treated the son as he had treated the father; he himself clothed him  with a khil’ah or dress of honour, and signed his appointment to the office of  Hajib.

Moslems] were expanded, and their hearts were rejoiced, when they heard of  ’Abdu-l-malek’s victories, and of the extensive districts which he daily conquered  from the unbelievers; and the birth of a son fof ’Abdu-l-malek] was hailed as  the greatest blessing which Andalus could receive.   In the year 393 (beginning Nov. 9, a.p. 1003) letters came from Al-mu’izz,  chief of the tribe of Maghréwah, who, at the death of his father, Zeyri Ibn ’Attiyah,  had become ruler of Fez and Western Africa, [acknowledging Hisham as his liege  lord.] ’Abdu-l-malek granted Al-mu’izz the investiture of Western Africa, on  condition that he would cause Hishdm’s name and his own to be proclaimed from  the pulpits [of all the mosques] in his dominions, and that he would send every  year to Cordova one horse and one shield, besides a certain sum of money, in token  of vassalage ; all which conditions Al-mu’izz promised to fulfil, sending his son Al-  mu’anser as an hostage to Cordova.   ’Abdu-l-malek followed in the steps of his celebrated father, as regards the [wise]  administration of public affairs and the [yearly] expeditions against the Christians,  of which he is said to have made no less than eight, always causing great loss  to the unbelievers, as for instance that of 394 (a. p. 1004), when he is well known  to have defeated the King of the Galicains, and to have taken and destroyed his  capital, the city of Litin (Leon).?_ In commemoration of that exploit, ’Abdu-l-  malek received the titles of Seyfu-d-daulah (sword of the state) and Al-modhaffer  (the conqueror, or victorious). He died on his return from the country of the  Christians, in the month of Moharram, a. u. 399 (Sept. a.p. 1008), or, according  to other authorities, in the year before (a. #. 398), although the former date is the  most probable. His administration lasted seven years, which were to the Moslems  like a succession of festivals, owing to which the period of his rule was called  As-sdbi’ or Al-oshi’ (the week), comparing it with the first week after marriage.   After the death of ’Abdu-l-malek, his brother ’Abdu-r-rahmdn succeeded him    Sey pro-in the charge of Hajib (chamberlain). ’Abdu-r-rahmdn assumed on the occasion    claimed.

He followed in the  steps of his brother and father as regards the seclusion of the Khalif Hisham, of  whose person he was the complete master, and the assumption into his hands of  all the powers of the state.   In the course of time, however, he undertook to usurp even the insignia of  the Khalifate as he had usurped the power, and to this end he asked Hish4m  ta appoint him his successor to the throne,—a request with which that weak  monarch complied, after assembling the counsellors of the state and the notaries  to witness the ceremony, and to authorize it by their presence. ‘‘ It was,” says  an author of those days, ‘‘a very solemn ceremony.” The deed [of nomination]",260,book_7,
"    CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 223    was drawn by Abii Hafss Ibn Burd, and copied in the Khalif’s own hand. We  here subjoin it :   “ This is what the Khalif Hisham Al-muyyed-billah, Commander of the Faithful,  “ stipulates with the people [of this country] in general, and what he himself  “‘ promises to observe and swears to fulfil, by placing his right hand upon the  “‘ deed as upon a true and valid contract. :   ‘“« After mature consideration and long deliberation, after reflecting upon the  ‘‘ heavy duties which God has imposed upon him as Imém and Commander  “of the Faithful, the Khalif Hisham, son of the Khalif Al-hakem Al-mustanser-  ‘ pillah, and grandson of the Khalif ’Abdu-r-rahmén An-nasir lidin-illah,—fearing  “lest fate should strike him that blow against which no mortal stands secure,  “and which no living creature has the power to avert; fearing lest death should  ‘‘ assail him suddenly, and take him by surprise; fearing, in short, that if he  “were to die thus, the people of this country would have no banner left under  ‘which they might flock, and no place of refuge to which they might run [in  *‘ case of need]; knowing that were he to present himself to his Creator after  ‘* so flagrant a dereliction of his duty, he would certainly incur his anger for  “‘ having neglected the charge intrusted to him, and having gone astray from the  ‘“‘ path of righteousness and truth,—has determined to select among the Arabs of  “the tribe of Koraysh, and others having their domicile in this country, one  ‘worthy of having this empire transmitted to him [as an inheritance], and of  “‘ being intrusted with the prosperity and welfare of this nation,—one whose  “ piety, religion, honesty, and good faith shall be notorious, one who shall be  “known to resist the temptations of sin, and to follow the path of righteousness  ‘« by practising those duties which are acceptable to his God.   “ After searching, therefore, high ranks as well as low, the Khalif Hisham  “has found none more deserving to be appointed his successor, or to become  “the heir to the Khalifate after his death, than the trustworthy, honest, and  “beloved Abi-l-motref ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, son of Al-manstir Ibn Abi ’A’mir Mo-  ‘ hammed, son of Ibn Abi ’A’mir.

And this  “the Commander of the Faithful does spontaneously, of his own free will, and  “in the presence of witnesses [called for that purpose], and, as such, orders it  ‘‘ to be transmitted and communicated to his subjects without any second thought  “* or restriction, pledging himself in public as well as in private, by word and deed,  “ by the stipulation of God, and by his promises, by the protection of his messenger  ‘“‘ Mohammed, and that of the four legitimate Khalifs who were his ancestors,  ‘and his own share in the intercession, to fulfil it in all its parts, and not swerve,  “* change, wander, or fall aside in any part of it; taking God and his angels to  “* witness of the truth of his words, and that he bequeaths his empire and transfers  “his sayings and doings to the here present Al-mdémin Abi-l-motref ’Abdu-r-  * rahman, son of Al-manstir, (may God prosper him!) who accepts what is given  ‘to him, and binds himself to fulfil the duties imposed upon him.”   This took place in the month of Rabi’ the first, a.

The Beni Umeyyah and the Korayshites were the most opposed to it ; they detested  the rule of ’Abdu-r-rahmén, and, moreover, they were much afflicted at seeing the",262,book_7,

They therefore united their counsels, visited each other,  and entered into a conspiracy to rid themselves of ’Abdu-r-rahm4n. Accordingly,  in the year 399 (a. p. 1009), whilst ""Abdu-r-rahmén was absent from Cordova on  one of his expeditions to the country of the Galicians, they rushed upon his  Sdhibu-sh-shorttah (captain of the guard), and slew him ° at his post, at the gate of  the royal palace in Cordova: they then deposed Hisham Al-muyyed, and appointed  in his room a prince of the posterity of the Cordovan Khalifs, whose name was  Mohammed, son of Hishdm, son of ’Abdi-l-jabbér, son of the Commander of the  Faithful, ’Abdu-r-rahmén An-ndsir lidin-illah, on whom they conferred the honorary  appellation of Al-muhdi-billah (the directed by the grace of God).   The news [of this revolution] having reached the point of the frontier nee) the  Hajib ’Abdu-r-rahm4n was then [at war with the Christians], he collected the  scattered divisions of his army, and returned hastily to Cordova, burning to take  _ vengeance on his enemies. However, when he approached the capital, he was deserted  by a great portion of the army and the principal Berber officers, who immediately  entered Cordova, and having sworn allegiance to the usurper Al-muhdi, instigated  him against the Hajib ’Abdu-r-rahmén, whom they represented as a madman, and  incapable of governing the people well. Some of them next went out of Cordova,  returned to the camp, and seized on ’Abdu-r-rahm4n,* whom they beheaded, taking Who is as-  his head to Al-muhdi and to the people of Cordova. Thus was the power of the “assis.  ’A’mirites overthrown. There is no God but God, He is the only survivor of empires !   On his accession to power, Mohammed assumed the surname of Al-muhdi (the pena  directed). Instead, however, of being contented with the title of Hajib, and jabbér usurps  reigning in Hishim’s name, as Al-manstir and his two sons had done, he confined Le  that unhappy monarch to an apartment of his palace, gave out that he was dead,  and took for himself the titles of Khalif and Imém. One of the first acts of his  government was to seize as many as he could of the chiefs attached to the party  of the ’A’mirites, and put them to death.   It has been stated above, that the chiefs of the Berbers and of the Zendtah, se pela  seeing the bad rule of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, and the subsequent overthrow of his him.  empire, had without difficulty embraced the party of the usurper Al-muhdi. The  Beni Umeyyah, however, could not forget the assistance which the Berbers had  formerly lent to the ’A’mirites, as they ascribed entirely to them the usurpation  of the royal power by Al-mansir and his two sons. They therefore hated them  most cordially, and could not bear the sight of them; and had it not been that  the Berbers were numerous, and united together by a sense of the necessity of  self-preservation, they would undoubtedly have been all destroyed to a man.

Moreover, as some of the Berber chiefs were  once returning from the palace, their houses were in the mean while attacked by  the populace and gutted of their contents. The offended immediately laid a  complaint before Al-muhdi, who, not daring to disregard their claims altogether,  had the guilty parties put to death. Yet with all this, Al-muhdi hated the Berbers,  and let no opportunity pass without showing them all the ill-will he bore them;  upon which the Berbers, having received intelligence of his ill designs, as well  as of his intention to make a general slaughter among them, called upon their  officers to advise them how to act upon the emergency. Having held a secret  council, they came to the resolution of dethroning Al-muhdi and of proclaiming  a prince of the race of Umeyyah, whose name was Hishém, son of Suleyman,  son of the Commander of the Faithful, An-ndsir lidin-illah. Their meetings,  however, could not be held so secretly as not to reach the ears of a few [in-  fluential citizens], who decided upon thwarting their plans. They, accordingly,  instigated against them the populace of Cordova, who took up arms, attacked them  in their cantonments, and expelled them from the city. This being done, Hisham  and his brother Abi Bekr were arrested and conveyed to the presence of Al-muhdi,  who beheaded them [with his own hand].   A nephew of the murdered princes, named Suleyman, who was the son of  their brother Al-hakem, succeeded in leaving Cordova in disguise, and repaired  to the camp of the Berbers, who, after their expulsion from the capital, had pitched  their tents at a short distance from it, swearing not to raise them until they had  taken ample vengeance on the citizens of Cordova. Suleym4n was received with  open arms by the Berbers, who hastened to swear allegiance to him, and proclaimed  him Khalif under the appellation of Al-musta’{n-billah (he who implores the  assistance of God), on condition that he would immediately lead them against their  enemies. Suleyman, however, thinking that the time was not yet come to make an  attack upon Cordova, dissuaded them from their undertaking, and retired with  them to the Thagher (frontiers of Toledo), where he applied for, and obtained,  from the son of Alfonso,’ a strong body of troops to aid him in his war with  Al-muhdi. Thus re-inforced, Suleym4n advanced by forced marches against Cor-  dova; upon which Al-muhdi, hearing of his approach, went out to meet him at  the head of the citizens and of the troops of that capital.

Suleymén advanced upon Cordova, of which he took possession, without ae  resistance, about the end of the fourth century [of the Hijra]. Al-muhdi fled to capital.

After this, Suleymén and his Berbers left Cordova, and scattered themselves over  the plains, plundering the inhabitants, and committing all manner of depredations,  until they retired to Jeziratu-l-khadhré (Algesiras). Thither they were followed by  Al-muhdi with his Christian auxiliary, the son of Alfonso; but this time the  Berbers were victorious: Al-muhdi and the Christians were completely defeated,  and were obliged to fall back upon Cordova, whither they were immediately  pursued by the victor.   On his arrival at Cordova, Al-muhdi took Hishém Al-muyyed-billah out of Restoration of  confinement, showed him to the people, and made them swear allegiance to him,  laying down all the power he had usurped, and reserving nothing for himself except  the office of Hajib [chamberlain]. This, however, was of no avail to him: Suleymén  and his Berbers soon appeared before the walls of Cordova; and the citizens,  fearing his vengeance, instigated the servants of the palace and the eunuchs of  Hishém against Al-muhdi, whom they represented as the only cause of their  troubles and dissensions. Upon this, one of the eunuchs of the palace, named  Wadheh Al-’dmiri, having with the assistance of his friends surprised Al-muhdi,  put him to death, and restored his master Hish4m to his liberty, assuming for  himself the charge of Hajib. ;   Thus perished Mohammed Al-muhdi at the end of the year 400 (August, a. p.   1010), and after a reign of about ten months. He is represented by the historians  of the time, as a man of depraved morals, a tyrannical ruler, and a blood-shedder.  Ibn Bessdm says that he had a garden in which the heads of his enemies were  fixed on stakes sunk in the ground. The following verses were composed by a  poet of those times :  “Our Mahdi (director) has appeared, but [instead of peace and justice] he  “ brings us vice and folly.  ‘“‘ He has made the wives of the Moslems common to every one; and what  ‘* was sacred before, is no longer so under his rule.  ‘* Indeed, those who were hornless yesterday, will to-day see their heads  ‘‘ ornamented with horns.” ®",265,book_7,
"    Cordova taken  by the Berbers.    228 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK vit.    During the reign of this Sult4n, and that of his rival Suleymén, the city of  Cordova was often exposed to the ravages of an undisciplined soldiery ; and the  palaces of Az-zahré and Az-zahirah were completely destroyed. ‘“‘ It is a fact well  ‘‘ worthy of remark,” says the historian Ibnu-r-rakik, ‘‘ that [in the course of  “‘ twenty-four hours] from Tuesday the 15th of Jumdda-l-akhar (a. u. 399), at the  “hour of noon, to the following Wednesday, Cordova was taken, Az-zahra®  ‘‘ destroyed, a Khalif [Al-muyyed Hishém] deposed, and another Khalif [Al-  “‘ muhdi] appointed in his stead; the power of the Beni ’A’mir was overthrown,  ‘‘and their Wizir, Mohammed Ibn ’Askaléjah, slain; armies of citizens were  ‘raised, the succession of the Wizirs was destroyed, and others occupied their  ‘* places: but the most remarkable fact is, that all this was accomplished by ten  ‘men, who were either sellers of charcoal, or butchers, or dung-carriers, and who  ** served in Al-muhdi’s army.”   Al-muhdi was a man of very dissolute morals, of little or no talent [for the  administration], but exceedingly cruel and revengeful. When Al-mansir usurped  the power of the Beni Umeyyah, and, as above related, slew or exiled all the  members of that family who stood in his way to the throne, he spared this Al-  muhdi,’’ owing to his imbecility and the little consideration which he enjoyed  among the people; and yet this very man, whom Al-mansir had not thought  worthy of his notice, was destined to overthrow his well-consolidated power, to  destroy all that he had founded, and, in short, to become the heir of his riches and  his power. No human wisdom or prudence can prevent the fulfilment of fate ;  no mortal creature can resist the immutable decrees of the Almighty, whose will  must needs be obeyed.   Al-muhdi was a tolerable poet. One night, as he was drinking with some of his  guests, a page of his presented to him a branch of myrtle; upon which Al-muhdi  uttered extempore the following verses :   ‘<I am presented with a tender branch of sweet-smelling myrtle, whose soft  ‘* undulations may be compared to thy lion-like gait ;   ‘“‘ Which resembles thee in gracefulness of step, as thou resemblest it  “in fragrancy.” ""   The siege of Cordova continued with unabated vigour, the inhabitants not being  able to gain any advantage over the troops of Suleymdn, until at last, the fields,  the farm-houses, and the lands round Cordova having been either wasted or set  fire to by the besiegers, the scarcity of provisions began to be felt in the capital,  and the besieged began to despair.   In the mean time Al-musta’in pressed the siege more closely than ever. In order  the sooner to accomplish his purpose, he sent to the people? of Alfonso, inviting",266,book_7,

Hishd4m, on the other hand, dis-  patched his Hajib, Wadheh, to the same quarter, to persuade the Christians not to  grant this request, promising, if they would withdraw their forces from his enemy,  to put them in possession of the fortresses which Al-manstr had reduced on the  frontiers of Kashtellah (Castilla). Upon these conditions Alfonso refused to send  the auxiliary troops which Suleyman requested: that chief, however, persevered in  his undertaking ; and, after a protracted siege, during which the poor people of  Cordova were exposed to all the horrors of a famine, he became at last master of  the capital on Monday the 6th of Shawwal of the year 403 (April 20, a. p. 1013).  A general massacre ensued ; the Khalif Hish4m was secretly put to death [by the stassacre of its  command of the victor],’* the houses of the inhabitants were sacked and profaned, b*bitants.  their women and daughters insulted, wealthy families reduced to poverty, mag-  nificent buildings razed to the ground. There was, in short, no excess of which  the infuriated Africans were not guilty on this occasion. Doctors, theologians,  Imd4ms, Kadis, men distinguished by their virtues, or eminent for their piety and  their learning, were involved in the general massacre. Among the victims of  that disastrous day, the celebrated traditionist and learned divine, Abi-l-walid (Abt  Mohammed) ’Abdullah Ibn Mohammed Ibn Yisuf Ibn Nasr Al-azdi Al-kortobi,  better known under the surname of Ibnu-l-faradhi, was one. This eminent man was  versed in various sciences, such as traditions, biographical history, and chronology.  He was well acquainted with literature, as appears from the numerous works which  he wrote, such as “ the lives of Andalusian divines and other men of science,”’ which  we ourselves saw and read in Western Africa,—a work admirable for its arrange-  ment and unique in its kind, the same to which an appendix was written by Ibnu  Bashkiéwal, under the title of Kitdbu-s-silah (the book of the joining).* He also  left a very fine work on that branch of the science [of genealogy] called Al-mokhtalef  wa-l-mutalef, or, what is different and alike in the patronymics of men; an  excellent history of the Andalusian poets, and several other productions of equal  merit. Ibnu-l-faradhi was born on Tuesday, the 21st of Dhi-l-ka’dah, of the year  351 (December; a. p. 962). At the age of twenty-one, he quitted Andalus for the  East, made his pilgrimage, and visited most of the large cities in Syria and Egypt,  where he met the most eminent professors of the time, and studied under them.  He then returned to his native country, where he obtained offices of trust, and was  at last appointed K4di of Valencia. Happening to be at Cordova on the day that  Suleyman took that capital by storm, his house was attacked by a party of Berbers,  who put him to death. They say that his body lay for three whole days in the  court of his house, and was at last privately interred without any ceremony, and  without having the funeral service said over it.",267,book_7,
"    Origin of the    Beni Hamid.    230 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vit.    Having rid himself of all his enemies, Suleyman imagined that his empire was  consolidated and his power strengthened. But he was mistaken; new competitors  started up, and he had soon to contend against the very Berber chiefs who had  contributed every where to his accession. The Berbers and the African slaves  possessed themselves of large towns and populous districts; as Badis Ibn Habis '*  of Granada, Al-birzdli of Carmona, Al-yeferani of Ronda, and Harzin '° of Sherish  (Xerez). Andalus was in course of time cut up into fragments and small prin-  cipalities, the command of which devolved upon men of the lowest rank in the  state, as Ibnu ’Abbdd, who rose at Seville; Ibnu-l-afttas, at Badajoz; Ibnu Dhi-n-  niin, at Toledo ; Ibn Abi ’A’mir, at Valencia; Ibn Htid, at Saragossa ; and Mujahid  Al-’émiri, at Denia and the [Balearic] islands. But we are rather anticipating  the narrative of events.   Among the Berber chiefs who followed the party of Suleyman Al-musta’in-billah,  there were two men of the posterity of ""Omar Ibn Idris ; their names were Al-kdsim  and ’Ali. They were the sons of Hamid, son of Maymin, son of Ahmed, son  of ’Ali, son of ’Obeydullah, son of ""Omar, son of Idris, [son of Idris,] son of  *Abdullah, son of Hasan, son of Huseyn, son of ’Ali Ibn Abi Talib. (May God  dispense his favours to them all!) Their ancestor was that same Idris who, in  order to escape the vengeance of Harin Ar-rashid, the ’Abbdsside, had fled from  the East and taken refuge among the Berbers of Africa; in which country he  founded a powerful and extensive empire, making war against that Khalif, as did  also his son [Idris], who inherited his empire and built the city of Fez.   ’Ali and his brother Al-kdsim arrived in Andalus, as before related, during the  administration of the Hajib Al-mansir, who employed them in his armies. Having  distinguished themselves in several encounters with the Christians, they were  gradually promoted, until each obtained the command of a considerable body of  troops of their nation. When the civil war, which the judicious historian Ibnu  Khaldiin has justly designated under the epithet of ‘‘ Berberiyyah,” (that of the  Berbers), broke out at Cordova, ’Ali and his brother Al-kdésim played an active  part in all the transactions of the time, helping with the troops under their  command to overthrow the power of the Beni ’A’mir, and to place Suleyman,  of the race of Umeyyah, on the throne. With a view to reward the services  of his partisans, and the more to strengthen his power, Suleyman divided among  the Africans the command of his armies and the government of the provinces  of his empire. Thus he gave to ’Ali Ibn Hamid the government of Tangiers,  Ghomérah, and other places in Africa, where that chieftain ruled as master,  although he acknowledged himself the vassal of Suleyman.   In the course of time, however, finding that the governors of the provinces had",268,book_7,
"    CHAP.

It is related against Su-  that the Khalif Al-muyyed Hisham was very much addicted to astrology and the ™  science of divination. One day as he was employed in his favourite pursuits with   one of his courtiers, he discovered that the dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah would   soon become extinct in Andalus, and would be replaced by another dynasty, of   which a man of the posterity of ’Ali Ibn Abi Télib, and whose name began with   the letter ’ayn (’A), was to be the founder. Accordingly, when in a.x. 403   (a. p. 1013) Suleyman took Cordova for the second time, and, as before related,  confined Hish4m to a dungeon, the latter having heard that there was among the  Berbers an officer named ’Ali, who was said to be the descendant of ’Ali Ibn   Abi Talib, he dispatched him a secret message thus conceived: ‘‘ Thou shalt   ‘‘ certainly become king of this land; for my heart tells me that I shall soon die   ‘ by the hands of this man (meaning Suleyman) : should such be my fate, I intrust   “* my revenge to thee.” To the above circumstance, it is said, was owing ’Ali’s  determination to rise in arms against Suleyman, and to dispute the empire with   him ; others attribute to him different motives. Be this as it may, after appointing   his son Yahya to command in Africa during his absence, ’Alf crossed over to  Andalus, where, being soon after joined by Khayrdn, the Sclavonian [governor   of Almeria], he gave out that he was come to revenge the murder of his lawful  sovereign Hish4m. No sooner, however, was Suleyman informed of his landing,   than he hastened against him at the head of his best troops ; but after several sharp  encounters with the troops (of ’Alf and Khayrdn], he was at last completely defeated ae  in the plain of Talikah (Italica), close to Seville, himself and his brother ’Abdu-r- to death.  rahmén falling into the hands of the victor; who, on his arrival in Cordova, which   made no resistance, caused them both to be beheaded together with their aged   father, Al-hakem.

One of the first acts of his administration was to cantor  check the licentiousness of the African soldiers, who, under the preceding reigns,  had been suffered to commit all manner of ravages, and to indulge their wicked  propensities on the peaceable inhabitants of Cordova. He succeeded by his salutary His exemplary  rigour in re-establishing discipline among the Berbers, and justice shone as bright mance.  as ever. He used on given days to sit at the gate of his palace to administer  justice and redress the wrongs of those who complained to him.

The following  anecdote, which we transcribe from the work of a trustworthy writer who was an  eye-witness, will give an idea of the exemplary justice which ’Ali dealt among the  Berbers. ‘‘ As ’Ali was once riding out of one of the gates of Cordova, called  “ Bdb ’A’mir [the gate of ’A’mir], he met a Berber on horseback, who carried  ‘* on the saddle before him a load of grapes. Having made him stop, ’Ali inquired  ‘‘ where and how he had procured the grapes. ‘I seized them like a man,’  ‘was the Berber’s answer. Upon which, ’Alf caused him to be immediately  “‘ beheaded, and directed that the head of the delinquent should be placed over  “the grapes on the horse’s back, and then paraded through the streets of the  “ capital, as a warning to the other soldiers of his nation.”   For eighteen consecutive months did this Sultan persevere in the right path,  administering justice with an even hand, and governing his subjects with modera-  tion and wisdom, until, having learned that the Andalusians, who could not  tolerate his rule, had raised up Al-murtadhi Al-merwani in the eastern provinces,  with the design of re-establishing the sovereignty of the house of Umeyyah, he  changed his conduct entirely, and laboured to depopulate Cordova and to exter-  minate its inhabitants. Accordingly, he relaxed in his severity towards the Berbers,  and things soon resumed their ancient course. The chief inhabitants of the place  were every where insulted, and their houses plundered ; the magnificent buildings  erected by the Beni Umeyyah were either entirely demolished or gutted of all  their valuables, and the ruin of the city proceeded with as much rapidity as it  had before done in the worst times: the rich citizens were forcibly dispossessed  of their wealth, and men remarkable for their piety or their learning subjected  to all manner of indignities. The tyrant went so far as to impose heavy tributes  and other illegal taxes, and, in order to raise money, he seized on the persons  of several wealthy inhabitants, and confined them to prison, until they should  pay the exorbitant sums he demanded as their ransom: he did more; when, after  paying the required money into his treasury, the friends and relatives of the  prisoners appeared in front of the gaol with led horses to convey them to their  respective dwellings, he issued orders for the confiscation of those, and the  prisoners were compelled to walk home. Among those who suffered on this  occasion was Abi-l-hazm [Jehwar], who became in after-time King of Cordova,  was succeeded by his son [Abd-l-walid], and was the founder of a dynasty which  has been included by the historians in the number of the petty dynasties of  Andalus.   These and other excesses, of which Ali was guilty, alienated from him the  good-will of the people, and revolt succeeded revolt in the provinces. At last",270,book_7,
"    CHAP.

Having then sent his letters to all those governors and chiefs who were known  to be secretly attached to the cause of the Beni Umeyyah, he prevailed upon  some of them to join his banners, and, having collected considerable forces, marched  against the capital.   No sooner was ’Ali apprised of that formidable insurrection, than he hastened Assssinstion  to take every measure to crush it in its birth; but whilst he was preparing to  march against his enemies, he became the victim of treason. He was assassinated  whilst in the bath by some of the Sclavonian pages who had formerly belonged  to the household of the Beni Merwdn. This event took place about the beginning  of Dhi-l-ka’dah of the year 408 (a.p. 1017). The Sclavonians who perpetrated  the deed were three in number: when they saw that ’Ali was dead, they hastened  to a place of safety within the palace, which was known only to them, and hid  themselves in it. When his death became public, the people of Cordova were  highly rejoiced. The duration of ’Ali’s reign is generally computed at two years,  but, according to the statement of an historian who verified the fact, he only  reigned twenty-one months and six days.'* Notwithstanding his foreign origin,  and his possessing none of those brilliant qualities which draw forth the admiration  and praise of the people, ’Ali had many accomplishments which revealed his noble  descent and the hereditary virtues of the race of Hashim.   Among the poets attached to his court, the most celebrated were Ibnu-l-  khayydt Al-kortobi, ""Obédah Ibn Maéi-s-sam4, and Ibn Derrdj Al-kastéli (from  Cazalla). ’Obddah, who was well known to profess the doctrines of the Shiites,  composed a very fine ode in praise of ’Ali, from which the following two verses  are taken:   “Your ancestor ’Ali began in the East what another ’Ali has accomplished  “in the West.   “* Let then all invoke the favours of God on him, and salute him ; for his is  “ the empire by right divine.” 9 :   The two following are the composition of Ibn Derr4j:   “*O Sun on the decline! the deep sorrow [on thy countenance] is, no doubt,  ‘* caused by the thought of thy sad [approaching] fate.   ** Intercede for me with the son of the intercessor; bear my message to the  ‘son of the messenger [of the Almighty].” ”   VOL.

After the death of ’Ali, his brother Al-késim Ibn Hamid, who was governor  of Seville, was raised to the supreme power. This Al-k4sim was ten years older  than his brother; both were the sons of Hamid, by the same wife, a descendant  also of the house of ’Ali Ibn Abi Télib. ’Ali had left two sons: one, named  Yahya, whom, as before stated, he appointed governor of Tangiers, Ceuta, and  other districts in Africa; the other, called Idris, who was governor of Malaga  at the time of his father’s death. The eldest, Yahya, was undoubtedly entitled  to the throne; his father ’Alf having, besides, designated him for his successor :  but the affections of the Berbers were greatly divided ; some inclining to the son,  some to the brother, of their late sovereign. However, the greater number leaned  towards Al-k4sim, owing in the first place to his being older than his brother ’Ali  when the latter took possession of the throne, and, secondly, to his being near  Cordova at the time of ’Ali’s death, whilst between them and Yahya there was  an intervening sea. They therefore sent messengers to him, to offer him the throne.  When the messengers arrived in Seville, they hastened to the palace, and com-  municated to Al-kd4sim the news of ’Ali’s death, and the wish of the troops that he  should succeed him. At first, Al-k4sim showed no joy whatever at the intelligence ;  he feared, no doubt, that the whole might be a stratagem of his brother to ascertain  his feelings towards him; he therefore hesitated to accept the throne offered to  him, and retained the messengers near his person until he verified the truth of  the matter. He then marched without delay to Cordova, where he was proclaimed  (by the troops] six days after the death of his brother.”   Al-k4sim’s administration was mild and just; only that, knowing that some of  the Berbers were secretly inclined to favour the claims of his nephew Yahya,  the governor of Ceuta, to the throne, he intrusted the defence of his person to  the African black slaves, of whom he bought a large number, forming them into  a body-guard, and intrusting to them the government of the provinces and the  command of his armies. The Berbers, however, took offence at this, and in  course of time forsook his cause entirely.   Meanwhile the people of Andalus, who detested the rule of the Beni Hamid,  the descendants of ’Ali [Ibn Abi Talib,] owing to their deriving their chief support  from the Berbers, in whose. hands the country actually was, were flocking from  all parts to swell the army of ’Abdu-r-rahmén Al-merwéni, who, as related, had  been proclaimed in the eastern provinces. ’Abdu-r-rahmdn was the son of    of the house of Mohammed, son of ’Abdu-l-malek, son of the great ’Abdu-r-rahman An-nasir    Umeyyah.    lidin-illah, ninth Sultén of the race of Umeyyah.

"    CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 235    rejoicing was extreme; for all were anxious to see the rule of the Beni Merwén  re-established in Andalus. Being joined by the forces of several petty kings,  who hastened to acknowledge him as their sovereign, Al-murtadhi marched upon  Cordova. Among his allies on this occasion were Mundhir At-tojibi, Lord of  Saragossa, and Khayrén Al-’émiri, the Sclavonian, Lord of Almeria. There came  also with him some auxiliary troops which the King of the Franks™ had sent  him. Hearing of the approach of Al-murtadhi to his capital, Al-kdésim went  out to meet him with his Berbers. It happened, however, by some strange  coincidence, that Mundhir and Khayrdn, though still following the party of Al-  murtadhi, were not on very good terms with him at the time, and by no means  so well disposed in his favour as they had been at first. ‘‘ Methinks,” said one  of them to the other, “that Al-murtadhi does not put on the same face now  “that he sees himself at the head of a powerful army, as when he was weak  “and needed our assistance. Be sure this wily man is meditating some treason  ‘‘ against us.” Upon this, Khayrén wrote to Zawi Ibn Zeyri, of Senhdjah, one  of the most brave and enterprising Berber chiefs in Andalus, who, during the  late civil commotions, had made himself master of Granada and the surrounding  districts, where he ruled independently, offering, if he would attack Al-murtadhi  on his road to Cordova, that he himself, and Mundhir, with the troops of the  Thagher (Aragon), and the freedmen and adherents of the Beni ’A’mir, who were  always hostile to the Beni Merwan, would immediately desert his cause, leaving  him to fight his own battle with the partisans of his family. To this proposition  Zawi readily assented, and the plan was concerted between them.   However, on his arrival before the walls of Granada, Al-murtadhi wrote a letter eee  to Zawi, calling upon him to take the oath of allegiance, and promising him great death.  rewards if he would join him with his forces. The letter having been read to ZAwi,  who, being a Berber, was not well versed in the Arabic language, he directed his  secretary to write on the back of it that chapter [of the Korén which begins thus] :  “ Ta ayyoha-l-kafirina.” * (O ye, the unbelievers!) On the receipt of the letter,  Al-murtadhi wrote him another, thus conceived: ‘“ Beware! for I am marching  “‘ against thee with a host of the bravest warriors of this country, and assisted  “by the Franks.” And he closed his letter with the following verse :   “Tf thou be one of us, I can announce to thee prosperity and success ; if  ‘* the contrary, thou wilt soon experience every calamity.”   When the letter was read to ZAwi, he ordered his secretary to turn it over and to  write upon the back of it the whole of that chapter [of the Koran] which begins  thus: ‘ The emulous desire of multiplying riches and children employeth you  “until ye visit the grave.” On the receipt of this message the indignation of",273,book_7,

Al-murtadhi was roused to the highest pitch: so great was his desire of revenge,  that he instantly abandoned the expedition he had concerted, and, instead of  marching upon Cordova, the seat of the empire, as he had intended, he deviated  from the road, and went to attack Zdwi in Granada, believing that he could  annihilate him in one hour. The hostilities, however, continued for some days,  until Zawi wrote to Khayrén to remind him of his promise, and to say that the  time was come for him to accomplish his treason and forsake the cause of Al-  murtadhi. Khayrdn’s answer was thus conceived: ‘‘ I have delayed [the execution  “ of my plans] in order that thou mightest appreciate the extent of our courage,  “and the irresistible fury of our attacks; but when thou next seest us encamped  ‘close to him, charge him with thy cavalry, and we shall then take to flight  “‘ and desert him.” It was done as agreed on between them, and on the morning  of the next day Z4wi made a desperate charge, at the head of all his cavalry, on  the troops of his adversary. Al-murtadhi withstood the attack with his wonted  bravery ; but no sooner had the engagement commenced, than he saw the banners  of Khayrén, Mundhir, and the other chieftains of the Thagher, turn away from  the field, and he was left to fight single-handed against the troops of Zawi. The  contest could not last long; after the slaughter of the greater part of his devoted  followers, Al-murtadhi was compelled to take to flight, and it was with the greatest  difficulty that he escaped from the field of battle.* The unfortunate prince remained  for some time in concealment; but Khayrdn having sent spies after him, he was  discovered and put to death at a place in the neighbourhood of Guadix, whither  he had gone for the purpose of crossing over to Africa, and being secure.» His  head was brought to Almeria and presented to Khayran and Mundhir, who had by  that time reached that city.",274,book_7,

Arter the battle in which Al-murtadhi was defeated, the whole of Andalus sub-  mitted to the Berbers, and their rule was firmly established throughout the country.  Al-késim caused the tent of Al-murtadhi, which, together with other spoils, had  fallen into the hands of the victor [Zdwi], to be pitched on the bank of the  Guadalquivir at Cordova, as a sign of the victory he had just gained over. his  enemy. Thousands of people went out of Cordova to see it, and manifested oe  sorrow by deep sighs escaping from their bosoms.   It was on this occasion that the poet ’Obddah Ibn Mai-s-samd4, who, as before  stated, was a partisan of the house of ’Ali, recited before Al-kdsim that ode of  his which begins thus:   ‘“‘ Thine is the victory; Khayrén has gone his way; and God has secured  “‘ the empire to the descendant of his messenger.” !

It happened  thus: Yahya, who, on the death of his father ’Ali, was governor of Ceuta, wrote  from that town to the principal Berber chiefs in Cordova, saying, ‘‘ My uncle has  ’ «deprived me of my father’s inheritance: not satisfied with this, he has also  ‘“‘ deprived you of the governments and offices won by your good swords, and  “« given them to his black slaves. I am coming among you to claim the throne  “of my father. Once in possession of it, I will reinstate you in the full enjoyment",275,book_7,

Whilst there, he  received letters from Khayran, Lord of Almeria, reminding him of the alliance which  had once existed between the writer and the father of Yahya, to whose elevation he  had contributed, and asking for his alliance and friendship. But his brother Idris  said to him, ‘‘ Place no confidence in Khayrén; he is an artful man and a traitor.”  —‘ Well, if it be so,” replied Yahya, ‘‘ we must manage him so as to make his arts  “‘ and his treasons useful to ourselves.” However, Yahya, relying on the promises  of the Berbers, determined upon attacking his uncle in Cordova. Having sent  his brother Idris to Africa, to govern there in his absence, he placed himself at  the head of whatever forces he could collect, and proceeded by forced marches  to the capital. Al-kdésim did not wait for the arrival of his nephew. Knowing  that he could place no reliance on his men, he left his capital secretly and at night,  accompanied only by five trusty servants, and arrived in Seville, where he was well  received by the Kédi Ibnu ’Abbéd. The departure of Al-kdsim took place on  Saturday, the 28th of Rabi’-l-akhar of the year 410 (Sept. 1, a.p. 1019). Soon  after, his nephew Yahya entered Cordova, and was proclaimed by the Berbers, the  black slaves, and the inhabitants of the place, on Saturday, the first of Jumada-l-  akhar (Oct. 3, a.p. 1019) of the same year.*   On his taking possession of the throne, Yahya assumed the surname of Al-  mu’tali (the exalted). Being proud of his noble origin, since he was descended  on his father’s side from ’Ali (Ibn Abi Télib], and his mother also was a descendant  of Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet, Yahya began to treat the great men of  his court with utter disregard, never admitting them to his presence, and passing  his time in the society of low and contemptible men. This made the chiefs of the  Berbers averse to Yahya; they complained loudly of his ingratitude, and clamoured  for the fulfilment of those conditions on which they had consented to support  his claim to the throne, one of which was that he should immediately recall the  immunities and privileges granted to the guard of black slaves (during the preceding  reigns]. This Yahya immediately granted; but the disaffected, not being satisfied  with the above concession, now made such exorbitant demands, that the treasury  would have been drained and the royal power seriously impaired, [had Yahya  acceded to their wishes.) The black slaves, moreover, not considering themselves  safe in Cordova, fled to his uncle Al-kdésim in Seville; their example being soon  followed by all those among the Berbers and Andalusian officers who were offended",276,book_7,
"    CHAP. I11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 239    at his behaviour, or who had in any measure been wronged by him. In addition to  this, it must be said, that not one of the petty kings of Andalus followed the party  of Yahya; the greater part still continued to have the khotbah said in his uncle’s  name, and a few remained faithful to the Beni Umeyyah, for whom and in whose  name they pretended to hold their governments. So that, in point of fact, the  power of Yahya did not extend beyond the walls of Cordova, and he soon came  to the conviction that should his uncle march against him, he could not defend  his capital, and he would inevitably fall into his hands. About the same time  Yahya received the intelligence that the city of Malaga, where his brother Idris  commanded in his name, was on the point of renouncing his rule ; for, whilst Idris  was at Ceuta, of which city he was also governor, the inhabitants of the former  place, profiting by his absence, had sent a secret message to Khayrdn, inviting  him to take possession of the city ; which that chieftain was preparing to accomplish.  All these considerations induced Yahya to abandon his capital: he accordingly left  Cordova at night, and fied to Malaga with a few trusty followers.   No sooner had Al-kdsim heard of his nephew’s abandoning Cordova, than he Al-késim re-  marched to that place from Seville. He re-entered his capital without opposition, Sion of Cor.  and the khotbah was again recited in his name on Tuesday, thirteen® days before”  the end of Dhi-1-ka’dah of the year 413 (Feb. 10, a.p. 1023). Al-k4sim, however,  did not long enjoy peace after his restoration ; new discords and civil wars breaking  out throughout Andalus. The black slaves, it is true, were, to a man, ranged under  his banners ; but the greater number of the Berbers were attached to his nephew ;  whilst a third party was formed at Cordova who wished for the restoration of the  dynasty of Umeyyah, and expected anxiously the rising of some member of that  family. The plans of the latter, however, did not then meet with success ; and the  consequence was, that fresh dissensions and deplorable calamities ensued. Al-kd4sim  ordered a most scrupulous search to be made throughout his dominions for all  the surviving members of the family of Umeyyah, who, in order to avoid the  persecution, were compelled to fly to the provinces, and take refuge in farms and  country-houses under various disguises.   In the mean while his nephew Yahya was not inactive. Having fitted out an  expedition in Malaga, he besieged and took Algesiras, which still held out for  Al-késim. His brother, Idris, likewise took possession of Tangiers, a city which  Al-mdmiin (Al-kdsim] had fortified with the utmost care, and wherein he kept his  treasures. Some time after this, dissension having broken out between the Berbers  and the citizens of Cordova, they came to blows in the streets. The latter being in Be People rise  greater number, Al-kdsim and his Berbers were compelled to evacuate the place, aul expel hin  and to pitch their tents in a field to the west of the city. From that place the i",277,book_7,

Berbers made most desperate assaults on the city for a period of fifty consecutive  days ; but the Cordovans built up with masonry the gates of their city, and made a  most vigorous defence from the top of the walls. At last, seeing the siege pro-  tracted, and provisions growing every day more and more scarce, the Cordovans  decided to make a last effort to drive the enemy from their walls. Having opened  one of the gates, they made a simultaneous and determined attack upon the  besiegers, who were utterly defeated, God Almighty being pleased to grant the  citizens of Cordova a very signal victory over their enemies. This took place  on Thursday, twelve days before the end of Sha’ban of the year 414 (November 2,  A.D. 1023). After this defeat, Al-kdsim’s army dispersed. The black troops  followed him to Seville, but the Berbers joined his nephew Yahya in Malaga.   On his departure for Cordova, Al-kdsim had left a son of his named Mohammed  to command in Seville, assisted by the counsels of two Wizirs whom he appointed.  One of these was Mohammed Ibn Zeyri, one of the principal Berber chiefs ;  the other, Mohammed Ibn ’Abbdd, then Judge and afterwards Sultan of Seville,  and the grandfather of Al-mu’tamed Ibn ’Abbdd, so celebrated in the annals  of Andalus. Ibn Zeyri being an influential man among his countrymen, the  Berbers, and being besides very ambitious, aspired to the supreme power; so    Theinhabitants gid Ibnu ’Abbdd. Accordingly, when Al-kdsim with the relics of his army    declare against    him, and shut  their gates.    He takes re-  fuge in Xerez.    Falls into the  hands of his  nephew.    appeared in sight of Seville, the two chieftains shut the gates of the city in his  face. Al-k4sim then tried to force the entrance; but he was repulsed, and several  skirmishes ensued, in which both blacks and Berbers fell in great numbers, Ibnu  ’Abbdd smiling internally and rejoicing all the time to see the two parties destroy  each other. At last Al-kdsim, despairing of gaining possession of the city, sent  in messengers to propose that if his son Mohammed and his family were safely  delivered into his hands, he would immediately raise the siege and retire elsewhere.  These terms being accepted by Ibn Zeyri, his son and family were suffered to  quit the city, and Al-kdsim marched to Sherish (Xerez). Scarcely, however, had  Al-kdésim had time to establish himself in that fortress, when his nephew Yahya  left Malaga at the head of considerable forces and besieged him in it. Al-kdsim  defended himself with great courage for twenty consecutive days, during which time  a great number of warriors fell on both sides. At last the contest ended in favour  of Yahya; for the citizens of Xerez, unwilling to bear any longer the hardships of  the siege, surrendered their city to him; upon which the blacks fled in every direc-  tion, and Al-kdsim and his son Mohammed fell into the hands of their incensed  relative. This happened in the year 415 (beginning March 14, a. p. 1024).6   They say that Yahya had upon a former occasion taken his most solemn oath  that, were his uncle to fall a prisoner into his hands, he would immediately put him         ",278,book_7,
"    CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 241    to death, and thus deprive him of all chance of getting possession of Cordova a third   time. He nevertheless postponed the execution of Al-k4sim until he should take the   advice of his counsellors to that effect. Having done so, he was recommended   to spare the life of Al-kdsim, but: to confine him in a dungeon within his own Is sent prisoner  castle at Malaga, that he might in future be safe against his attacks. They say that ® ae  whenever Yahya was intoxicated, which was of frequent occurrence, he being   very much addicted to drinking spirituous liquors, he always showed an inclination   to order his uncle’s execution; but that his guests never ‘failed to implore his  mercy, and to remind him that his enemy was now under his power and could  nowise escape. They say also that Yahya saw frequently in dreams his own  father, ’Ali, who forbade him to put him to death, saying, ‘“‘ Al-kdsim was my  “elder brother; he used to be very fond of me when I was a child, and whilst   “TI commanded in this country I always found him obedient to my rule. By   “ Allah! have mercy on him!” Yahya therefore refrained for some time; but  having afterwards received information that Al-k4sim was tampering with the  guards of his prison, with a view to effect his escape and take up arms against   him, he had him strangled in his prison, thirteen years, or thereabouts, after   his falling into his hands, that is to say, in the year 427 (beginning November 4,   A.D. 1035),” although there are not wanting historians who assert that he died a  natural death. But to return.   After the retreat of Al-kdésim and his Berbers from before the walls of  Cordova, the inhabitants of that capital remained for nearly two months without  a leader, deliberating among themselves whom they would choose for their sove-  reign. At last, on Tuesday, the 15th® of the month of Ramadhan of the year  414 (Dec. 1, A. p. 1023), three princes of the race of Umeyyah presented them-  selves as candidates; namely, ’Abdu-r-rahmén, son of Hishdm, and brother  of Mohammed Al-muhdi, formerly Khalif of Cordova; Suleymdn, son of Al-  murtadhi, and another one. At first, Suleyman counted the most votes, and it is  even stated that the deed of inauguration was drawn in his name, as was cus-  tomary on such occasions, and that he was publicly proclaimed through the streets  of Cordova; but the party of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn having prevailed, Suleyman and Al-mustadh’her    of the house of  the other candidate kissed his hand in token of obedience, and he was pro- Umeyyah is    claimed under the name of Al-mustadh’her (he who implores the assistance of Corowa  God). Immediately after this, Al-mustadh’her (’Abdu-r-rahman IV.] rode to the  royal palace, taking with him his two cousins above named,® whom he caused to  be imprisoned.  Al-mustadh’her had, on his accession to power, raised several of his partisans  to the highest rank in the state, admitting them to his privacy and treating them    VOL. I. 21",279,book_7,

In the number were,  Abt ’A’mir Ibn Shoheyd,” celebrated for his courage and military virtues; Abi  Mohammed Ibn Hazm, well known for his satirical and controversial writings  against the Ulemas of various religious schools ; and his cousin ’Abdu-l-wahhéb Ibn  Hazm Al-ghazzal, a youth of very loose morals. This gave offence to the Sheikhs,  the Wizirs, and other influential citizens: upon which, Al-mustadh’her threw himself  for protection into the arms of the Berbers, to whom he granted new immunities  and privileges. But whilst Al-mustadh‘her passed his time with Ibn Shoheyd and the  two Ibn Hazm, engaged in literary pursuits and in writing poetry, the discontented  took advantage of the state of things, and began to excite the lower classes of  Cordova against him, by representing him as a frivolous man who spent his time  with poets and sycophants. This they failed not to accomplish, the people of  Cordova being then in a state of the grossest ignorance.   There were at the time in the prisons of Cordova several criminals whose  detention was deemed necessary [to the welfare of the state]. Among the rest  was one named Abi ""Imrén, whom Al-mustadh’her caused to be set at liberty  against the advice of one of his Wizirs, who urged him strongly to keep him  in prison. Al-mustadh‘her, however, disregarding all warning, caused the prisoner  to be liberated. This Abi ""Imran was the cause of Al-mustadh‘her’s ruin; for  he, and all those who came out from prison, began to plan his destruction, and  to substitute perdition for his joy, taking as a pretence to make partizans among  the people, that Al-mustadh’her neglected the affairs of government and passed  his time with literary men and poets, as his low inclinations prompted him. A  conspiracy was accordingly formed, with the assistance of the Berbers, the object of  which was to deprive him of the throne, and to appoint a relative of his, named  Mohammed, in his stead. He was assassinated in the month of Dhi-l-ka’dah  of the same year in which he had been raised to the Khalifate, after a reign of  forty-seven days,’ he being then in the twenty-third year of his age. When God  Almighty has decreed that an event shall happen, there is no mortal who can  prevent its fulfilment!   Mohammed was the son of ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn ’Obeydillah,'? whom Al-mansiir  Ibn Abi ’A’mir caused to be put to death, because he was planning a revolt against  the Khalif Hishim. On his accession to the throne Mohammed took the sur-  name of Al-mustakfi-billah (he who is contented with God). His reign, however,  was not of long duration; for, sixteen months after his elevation to power, in the  year 416 (a. p. 1025), Yahya Al-mu’tali, who, since the defeat and capture of his  uncle Al-kdésim at Xerez, had ruled undisturbed over Malaga and Algesiras,  marched his army to Cordova, and entered that city without opposition, the Khalif",280,book_7,

Ibnu Bashktiwdl says, that she was the  most eloquent woman of her age, and that in point of learning and taste she  rivalled the best poets of her father’s court. The histories of the time are filled  with entertaining anecdotes respecting this princess; but as we intend to treat  of her elsewhere,'* and to transcribe largely from the works of Al-fat’h, Ibnu Sa’id,  and Ibnu-l-abb4r, who have all written her life, we need not relate them in this  place. She lived to a great age, and died on the second day of Safar of the  year 480 (May 8, a.p. 1087), although there are not wanting authors who place  her death in 484, (a.p. 1091). She was equally celebrated for her chastity as for  her beauty, and she never married.   But to return to our account of the Sultdns of the house of ’Ali. No sooner  had Yahya entered Cordova, than, leaving a general of his named Ibn ’Ittdf, to  govern in his name, he quitted that capital and retired to Malaga, where he began  to make preparations for the ensuing campaign against Abi-l-kasim Ibn ’Abbdd,  Lord of Seville. Soon after, however, in 417, (beginning Feb. 21, a. pv. 1026,'5) :  the inhabitants of Cordova rose against their governor and his Berber troops,  fought with them in the streets, and ultimately expelled them from the capital ; The citizens    ? proclaim    after which they appointed a prince of the race of Umeyyah, named Hisham, fishin Al.  brother of the deceased Al-murtadhi, to administer their affairs. This was done Lael  by the advice of the Wizir Abi Mohammed Jehwar Ibn Mohammed, at that time   the most influential person in Cordova, and one in whom the people of all classes   placed their confidence. As Hishdm was then at Lerida, in the Thagher (Aragon),   with Ibn Hid, a message was sent to him, offering him the crown, and inviting   him to repair to Cordova. Hishdm accepted the invitation, and assumed on the  occasion the surname of Al-mu’tadd-billah (he who is prepared in God). This  happened in the year 418 (beginning Feb. 10, a. p. 1027). Hisham at first did not  proceed to Cordova, but remained for three years in the Thagher (Aragon), going   from one place to another.’® At last, civil war having broken out among the   petty chieftains, who about that time began every where to show symptoms of  independence, it was agreed among them that Cordova should [notwithstanding   their pretensions] continue to be the capital of the Mohammedan empire in  Andalus. Hearing of that determination, Ibn Jehwar and the citizens of Cordova  entreated Hish4m to come among them; which he did, about the close of the   year 420 (Dec. a.p. 1029). Hishdm was a mild and enlightened ruler, and  possessed many brilliant qualities; but notwithstanding all that, some time after   his entrance into the capital, the volatile and degenerate citizens of Cordova",281,book_7,

Hish4m left the capital and retired to Lerida, where he died in  428 (a.p. 1036). He was the last member of that illustrious dynasty which  had ruled over Andalus and a great portion of Africa for a period of two hundred  and eighty-four years, counting from the accession of ’Abdu-r-rahmén I., surnamed  Ad-dakhel, in 138 (a. p. 756). There is no God but him! He is the Almighty !   Meantime Yahya had not given up all hopes of regaining possession of his  capital, or chastising the rebellion of Abi-l-kdésim Ibn ’Abbdd, who, as before  related, had declared himself independent in Seville. He therefore kept his army  continually in motion, besieging either the one or the other of those cities, until  the people of Cordova agreed to submit to him, and give him possession of their  castles and cities. In this manner Yahya’s power increased; but having, in the  year 427 (beginning Nov. 4, a.p. 1035), marched against Abi-l-késim Ibn ’Abbdd,  Lord of Seville, he was assassinated’ near Carmona by some of his own men, at  the instigation of that chieftain.",282,book_7,

Andalus divided into petty kingdoms—Kings of Malaga, of the family of Idris—Kings of Algesiras—  of Granada— Cordova— Seville—Toledo— Saragossa — Badajoz— Valencia—Murcia—Almeria— The  Balearic Islands.    We have already alluded in several chapters of this work to the deplorable emetnel  revolution and disastrous events by which the mighty power of the Beni Merwan petty king-  was overthrown, and their extensive dominions in Africa, as well as in Andalus, ome  became the prey of ambitious chieftains, thus affording an opportunity to the   cruel enemy of God to attack in detail the divided Moslems, and to expel them   at last from those countries which they had so long held in their power. We   shall now proceed to give a rapid sketch of each of those dynasties which built   their power on the ruins of the Khalifate.   And, first, the Beni Hamid. After the death of Yahya Al-mu’tali, who, as ings ete  related, was assassinated, in the year 427 (beginning Nov. 4, a. p. 1035), by some family of Idris.  of his own followers, the army sent for his brother, Idris Ibn ’Ali, who was at that  time in Ceuta, and proclaimed him Amtru-l-miémenin (Commander of the Faithful)  and Sultén of Andalus, with the surname of Al-mutdyyed-billah (the confirmed by  the grace of God).! Idris was immediately proclaimed in Ronda and its depen-  dencies, in Almeria and Algesiras, as well as in his own family dominions of Ceuta  and Tangiers, which he intrusted to the care of his own nephew, Hasan, appointing  a eunuch named Naja to administer his counsels. Idris’ first care was to revenge  his brother’s death. Having? sent an army to make war against Abi-l-kdsim  Isma’il Ibn ’Abbéd, the father of Al-mu’tadhed Ibn ’Abbdd [who reigned afterwards  in Seville], after some sharp encounters the head of his enemy was brought to  him in the year 431 (beginning Sept. 22, a.p. 1039). Idris, however, did not  long enjoy his victory; he died two days after the head of his enemy was laid at  his feet.",283,book_7,
"    246 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vil1.    After the death of Idris, the army proclaimed his son Yahya, who did not,  however, assume the command; for another party having inaugurated Hasan, son  of Al-mu’tali, he [Yahya] took refuge in the fortress of Komdresh (Comares),  where he died in the year 434 (beginning Aug. 20, a.p. 1042); some say that  he was secretly put to death by the eunuch Najd. According to the historian  Ibnu Khaldin, it happened thus: ‘On the death of Idris, Ibn Bokennah,  “who was one of his Wizirs, contrived to have himself proclaimed at Malaga ;  ‘but no sooner did Najd, the eunuch, who was then at Ceuta, hear of it, than  “he crossed over to Malaga, bringing with him Hasan, the son of Yahya Al-  “‘ muta’li, whom he caused to be immediately proclaimed by the citizens and the  “army under the name of <Al-mustanser-billah. When Najé saw his master’s  “ authority fully established in Malaga, he returned to Ceuta, of which city Hasan  “had granted him the investiture, as well as of all his other possessions in the  “country of Ghomérah. Hasan died in the year 434 (beginning Aug. 20, a. p.  ‘* 1042), from the effects of poison ministered to him by a daughter of his uncle  “ Idris, in revenge for the death of her brother [Yahya Ibn Idris], whom that  ‘“monarch caused to be put to death on his accession to the throne.”   ‘On the death of Hasan,” says Ibnu Khaldin, ‘“‘ Naj4 again crossed over to  ‘* Malaga, with the intention of having himself proclaimed by the troops. During  “his absence he trusted the government of Ceuta and Tangiers in the hands of  ““a Sclavonian eunuch, in whom he placed all his confidence. THe set sail and  “ landed in Malaga, where he so far succeeded in his ambitious designs as to usurp  ‘* all the authority in the state. He was, however, soon after assassinated by the  “* Berbers, who appointed to the vacant throne another son of Yahya Al-mu’tali,  “named Idris. Ever since the death of his brother Hasan, Idris Ibn Yahya had  ‘“‘ been confined in a dungeon at Malaga.”   No sooner had the Berbers put to death Naja, than they took Idris out of prison,  and, after some previous negotiations, they proclaimed him under the name of  Al-’dli-billah (the exalted by the grace of God) on Thursday, six days before the  end of Jumdda 11. of the year 434 (Feb. 6, a.p. 1043). His authority was  immediately acknowledged at Granada and Carmona, the khotbah being said in his  name in the mosques of those places. This monarch is the one alluded to and  praised in a kasstdah, composed by Abi Zeyd ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ibn Mokéné  Al-fondaki, a native of Lisbon, and one of the poets mentioned in the Dhakhirah  (the hoarded treasure) by Ibn Bessim. This poem, of which we gave some extracts  in the first book (vol. i. p. 100), is well known throughout the West, and begins  thus :   ‘« Lightning flashes in the ethereal regions, and thy eyes are bathed in tears.

He was succeeded by his nephew Idris, son of Yahya Ibn Idris, who, upon his  accession, assumed the title of Al-muwaffek-billah (he who prospers by the grace of  God) ; but he was not proclaimed Khalif in the mosques. After a reign of a few  months, his cousin Idris Al-’4li, the same prince alluded to in the above poem, who,  since his dethronement, had lived in the castle of Comares, marched to the capital,  Malaga, and, having taken possession of it, gave it to his slaves to plunder, in  revenge for the injuries he had received at the hands of the inhabitants, most of  whom quitted that place and went to settle elsewhere. Al-’dli died in the year 446  or 447 (a. p. 1054-6).*   After him reigned Mohammed, son of Idris,° who, on his accession to the throne,  assumed the surname of Al-must’ali-billah (the exalted by the grace of God). . This  monarch was dethroned by Badis Ibn Habiis, King of Granada, who, in the year’  449 (beginning March 9, a. p. 1057), marched against him and took possession  of his capital, Malaga. After the loss of his kingdom, Mohammed retired to  Almeria, where he led a private life, until, in the year 456 (beginning Dec. 24,  A.D. 1063),® the citizens of Melilla invited him to come among them; this he did,  when they elected him for their sovereign, and he ruled over them until the year  460 (Nov. 10, a. pv. 1067), when he died.”   During these events the city of Algesiras and the neighbouring districts were Of Algesiras.  under the sway of princes descended also from the family of Hamid.

This Mohammed, having some time after succeeded in making  his escape, fled to Algesiras, of which city, as well as the surrounding districts,  he made himself master, assuming the surname of Al-muw’tassem-billah (he who  looks to God for protection from sin). Mohammed maintained himself in pos-  session of his states, until he died in the year 440 (beginning June 15, a. p. 1048).

In this manner  was the dynasty of the Sherifs, sons of Hamid, overthrown in Andalus, after  some of them had assumed the title of Khalif, as before related.   About the same time that the Beni Hamid established themselves in Malaga,  a Berber chief, named Z4wi, was founding a kingdom in Granada. This Zawi  was the son of Zeyri, son of Munad, of the tribe of Senhdjah. His kunya or  surname was Abii Mothna.

ZAwi having  distinguished himself in war against the Christians, Al-manstir gave him the  command of a body of African troops, and appointed him one of his Hajibs, or  chamberlains. When Mohammed Al-muhdi, after the assassination of ’Abdu-r-  rahmén Ibn Al-mansir, usurped the royal power, ZAwi, with the rest of the Berber  troops, embraced the cause of Suleyman, and assisted him in getting possession  of Cordova, which was taken by storm on Monday, the 6th of Shawwél, a. u. 403  (April 20, a.p. 1013), and its unhappy inhabitants subjected to all manner of  cruelties practised upon them by a brutal and ferocious soldiery. It is related,  that on this occasion Zéwi found in one of the palaces at Cordova, called Al-jodrat,  the head of his father, Zeyri Ibn Mundd, who had been put to death during the  Khalifate of Al-hakem Al-mustanser-billah,® and that he gave it to his soldiers  to have it properly buried.   During the civil wars which broke out in Andalus after the death of Suleyman,  Zawi retired to Granada, of which city and its districts he had been appointed  governor by that Sultan, and strengthened himself in it. We have related elsewhere  (p. 235) how when Al-murtadhi, of the house of Umeyyah, requested Zawi to make  common cause with him against ’Ali Ibn Hamid, the Berber chief refused his  application, attacked him on his road to Cordova, and put him to death. In the  year 410 (beginning May 8, a.p. 1019) Zawi crossed over to Africa,’® leaving  in command of Granada a nephew"" of his, named Habis Ibn Mékesen Ibn Zeyri,  who took possession of Cabra, Jaen, and other places, and became in time one  of the most powerful monarchs of Andalus.   Habis died in the year 429 (beginning Oct. 13, a. p. 1037),!? and was succeeded  by his son Badis [Ibn Habis], surnamed <Al-modhaffer (the victorious), who  acknowledged himself the vassal of the Beni Hamid of Malaga, and said the  khotbah in their name. Shortly after his accession, Badis had to defend himself  against Zohayr, the Sclavonian King of Almeria, who invaded his dominions at the  head of considerable forces ; but Badis marched against him, defeated him, and put  him to death. This happened in Shawwél of the year 429 (July, a. pv. 1038). Mo-",286,book_7,

Baddis likewise made war on Al-kddir  Ibn Dhi-n-ntin, King of Toledo; and in the year 449 (beginning March 9, a. p.  1057), perceiving the weak state into which his neighbours, the Beni Hamid, had  fallen, he took possession of Malaga, which he added to his own dominions.  According to Ibnu-l-’askar, Badis died on the twentieth of Shawwdl, a.u. 469  (May 16, a.p. 1077),! after a long and prosperous reign. Ibnu-l-khattib says that  Bédis was the first [king of his race] who surrounded Granada with walls, and built  its kassdbah and a palace for his own residence.   He was succeeded by his grandson ’Abdullah, son of Balkin,'* surnamed Al- Cordova.  modhaffer (the victorious), who intrusted the government of Malaga to his brother  Temim. ’Abdullah reigned undisturbed over Granada and the neighbouring districts  until the year 483 (beginning March 5, a.p. 1090), when he was deprived of his  kingdom by Yisuf Ibn Tashefin, the Almoravide, as we shall describe hereafter.   It has been related above (p. 243) how the inhabitants of Cordova, after shaking  off the yoke of the Beni Hamid, appointed a prince of the race of Umeyyah,  named Abi Bekr Hishém, son of Mohammed, son of ’Abdu-l-malek, son of  *Abdu-r-rahman An-ndsir, to rule over them; and how, after administering the  affairs of the state for nearly three years with great justice and moderation, the  inconstant citizens of Cordova deprived the monarch of their choice of his power,  and expelled him from their city. As there remained no other member of the  house of Umeyyah to whom they could offer the throne, the people of Cordova met  together, and determined upon giving the command to Abi-l-hazm Jehwar Ibn  Mohammed, a man of much wisdom and experience, who had once been Wizir  of the Beni Umeyyah under the administration of the Beni Abi ’A’mir. Jehwar at  first assumed no other title than that of Wizir of the Beni Umeyyah. It appears,  even, that with a view to reduce to obedience the petty rulers of Andalus, he pre-  tended that Hish4m Al-muyyed-billah was still living; and, having caused prayers  to be said in his name, he wrote to the Kédi Ibnu ’Abbiéd [Mohammed], King of  Seville, to Al-mundhir, King of Saragossa, and to Ibn Dhi-n-niin, King of Toledo,  inviting them to send in their allegiance to Hish4m, and to acknowledge Cordova  as the capital of Andalus. None, however, listened to his words; upon which,  Jehwar, perceiving that his stratagem produced not the desired effect, published  that Hish4m was dead, and usurped the royal power. He governed, however, with  great moderation and justice, although his rule was scarcely obeyed beyond the  walls of Cordova. At his death, which happened in the month of Safar, 435   VOL.

(Sept. or Oct. a. p. 1043), Jehwar was succeeded by his son, Abt-1-walid Moham-  med, who followed in the steps of his father, until, broken down by infirmities and  old age, he abdicated in favour of his son, ’Abdu-l-malek. This latter did not  long enjoy his power ; for soon after his accession he lost his life and his throne,  as we shall relate hereafter.’   Among the most celebrated petty dynasties of Andalus was that of the Beni  ’Abbdd, Kings of Seville and Al-gharb (Algarve), one of whom was Al-mu’tamed  Ibn ’Abbdd, whose fame spread widely both in the East and West, and whose deeds  are recorded in the Kaldyid and the Dhakhtrah, in a manner that leaves nothing to  desire. The historian, Ibnu-l-lebbanah,""* has said that there never was a dynasty  which more resembled the powerful one of the Beni *Abbés of Baghddd in extent of  generosity and the number of their virtues ; and under that impression he composed  that celebrated work of his, entitled Al-’itimdd ft akhbdr Bent ’Abbdd (the support :  on the history of the Beni Abbad). We have already quoted (vol. i. p. 395) two  verses composed by an African poet in derision of the dynasty of ’Abbad :   “‘ Among the things which make me dislike Andalus are the names Al-  “« mw tadhed and Al-mu’tamed [assumed by its rulers] ;   ‘‘ Names of kings whose dominions are not in that country. It is, indeed,  “ like the cat, in the tale, trying to swell himself into a lion.”   But there can be no doubt that the poet who wrote these verses entertained  a bad feeling towards Andalus in general, or that dynasty in particular; for the  works of poets and historians abound with anecdotes indicative of the splendour  and magnificence with which the kings of Seville surrounded their courts, the  boundless prodigality with which they rewarded authors and poets, and the love  and enthusiasm which they themselves showed for the sciences.   The founder of this dynasty was Mohammed Abi-l-kdsim, Kadi-l-jam’ah  (supreme judge) of Seville. He was the son of Isma’il, son of Karis (or Koraysh),!7  son of ’Abbad, son of ’Amru, son of Aslam, son of ’Amru, son of ’Ittéf, son of  Na’im, of the tribe of Lakhm, of the posterity of An-no’man, son of Al-mundhir  Ibn Maéi-s-sam4, the last King of Hirah. The first member of that illustrious  family, who settled in Andalus, was ’Ittdéf, who entered that country in the suite  of Balj Ibn Beshr, the Syrian, in the year 123 (a.p. 741). ’Ittaf was originally  from a pretty town called Al-’arish, situated on the skirts of the desert which  separates Syria from Egypt. He settled at Yaumeyn, a town in the district of  Toshénah (Tocina], belonging to the jurisdiction of Seville. The first individual  of the family who attained any celebrity was Isma’il, son of Koraysh, surnamed  Abi-l-walid, who became Sdhibu-sh-shorttah to Hisham Al-muyyed-billah, and  filled for some time the functions of Imam at Seville.""® At his death, his son    ",288,book_7,

We have elsewhere related (p. 240) how,  when in the year 414 (a. p. 1023) Al-kd4sim Ibn Hamid appeared before the walls  of Seville, flying before his nephew Yahya, the inhabitants of that city determined  upon shutting their gates in the face of that Sultén, and administering their affairs  by themselves independently of the Beni Idris; for which end they appointed a  council composed of three individuals. The Kadi Ibnu ’Abbdd was one of them ;  but being an ambitious and shrewd man, and possessing great influence in Seville,  he succeeded in getting rid of his colleagues and usurping all the power to  himself. After slaying Yahya Ibn ’Ali, who was besieging him in Seville, the Kadi  Ibnu ’Abbdd imagined that he could not effectually consolidate his empire and  expel the Idrisites from Andalus, unless he succeeded in uniting under one common  standard all the partisans of the house of Umeyyah. For this end he procured  a man resembling in age and appearance the Khalif Hisham, (murdered during  the civil wars of Cordova,) and, causing the khotbah to be said for him in all  the mosques of his dominions, assumed the title of Hajib (chamberlain), and  professed to reign in his name.'!® After this, the K4di Ibnu ’Abbdd sent his son  Isma’il against Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Al-birzdli, Lord of Carmona and chief  of the Berber party in those parts ; but Mohammed, having called to his assistance  the Berbers of Granada and the Beni Idris of Malaga, Isma’il was defeated and put  _to death in a. u. 431 (beginning Sept. 22, a. p. 1039).   The Kadi Ibnu ’Abbdd died on Sunday, one day before the end of Jumada,  the first, of the year 433 (January 23, a.p. 1042). He was succeeded by his  son Abi ’Amru ’Abbdd Fakhru-d-daulah (glory of the state), who, upon his  accession to the throne, assumed the surname of Al-mw’tadhed-billah (he who  implores the assistance of God). This ’Abb4d was a powerful prince, who reduced  under his sway the greater part of Andalus. He took Cordova”! from the Beni  Jehwar, and also made extensive conquests in Al-gharb (the western districts).  The poet Ibnu-l-lebbinah describes Al-mu’tadhed in the following words: ‘ Al-  “ mu’tadhed Abi ’Amru ’Abbdd was a prince whose life was to his enemies what  “ fetters are to the feet of the prisoner; whose sword never ceased spilling blood  “and taking away souls. Such, indeed, was the number of his victims, that he  “‘ actually had before the door of his house an enclosure filled with the skulls  “* of the slain, the spoils of prince and subject. There was nothing Al-mu’tadhed  ** liked so much as to look at this enclosure, and he used to spend the greater part   “* of his time gazing at it; he would often weep and feel compassion for his victims.  © Such anecdotes are related of his cruelty, that it is better that they should be  “kept away from human ears and not brought to light.",289,book_7,
"    252 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book VII.    “« Al-mu’tadhed was a good poet. The two following verses, which he composed  ‘* when the city of Ronda fell into his power, are remarkable :   ‘Thou shalt be strengthened, O Ronda, and made a bulwark to our  ‘ empire.  ‘ We will soon provide thee with spears and sharp-edged swords.’ ” *   Al-mu’tadhed Ibn ’Abbdd died in Jumdéda, the second, of the year 461 (May,  A.D. 1069), after a prosperous reign of about twenty-eight years. He was succeeded  by his son Abd-l-k4sim Mohammed, surnamed Al-mu’tamed ’ala-illah (he who  relies on God), who was then twenty-nine years of age, having been born at Beja, in  Al-gharb (Estremadura), in 432 (beginning Sept. 10, a. p. 1040).   The KA4di and learned theologian Abi Bekr Ibn Khamis [(’Abdu-l-jabbar As-  sikilf], when he comes to treat of the Beni ’Abbdd, says as follows: ‘‘ Such were  ‘the brilliant qualities of Al-mu’tamed, that, although his praises are in every  “‘ body’s mouth, yet enough cannot be said of him to do him justice. I will now  *‘ relate some of his adventures, to which I will add some of the poetical com-  ‘ positions which I have read of as attributed to him; for he was as well versed  ‘in literature as he was excellent in poetry. His name was Mohammed, and his  ‘‘ kunya or surname Abi-l-kdsim, like his grandfather the Kadi [Abié-l-kasim].  ‘‘ He assumed the supreme power after the death of his father, Al-mu’tadhed.  “ Alluding to this event, a poet, named Al-hosri, has said,—   ‘ *Abbdd is dead, and yet a noble shoot remains [of the parent tree].  ‘The dead therefore is alive, only that the dhdd [of Al-mu’tadhed] is  ‘turned into a mém [Al-mu’tamed].’” *   “ Al-mu’tamed,” says the historian Ibnu-l-lebb4nah, ‘‘ continued to reign in pro-  “ sperity until the year 475 (beginning May 31, a.p. 1082). In that year the Jew,  “ Tbn Shdlib, came to Seville with a number of Christian knights, for the purpose  “* of receiving the yearly tribute which Al-mu’tamed was in the habit of paying to  “ Alfonso. The Jew and his suite alighted at one of the gates of the city, whither,  ** after they had made known the object of their visit, the Sultan immediately sent  “‘ them the money required, by one of the high officers of his court. The Jew, how-  “ ever, refused to receive it, saying, ‘I will not take this money ; I will take nothing  ‘* but pure gold, and next year we will not be satisfied with any thing short of the  ‘‘ whole wealth of the country:* return it to him.’ The money was accordingly  ‘“‘ returned to Al-mu’tamed, who was no sooner acquainted with the Jew’s insolent  ‘“ speech, than he ordered some of his guards to drag the Jew and his suite to his  ‘* presence, and to cut the strings of the tent wherein they were. His commands  “being executed, and the Christians brought before him, Al-mu’tamed ordered  ‘“‘that the Jew should be nailed to a stake, and his companions sent to prison.    ",290,book_7,
"    CHAP. 1Vv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 253    ‘“‘ When the accursed Jew heard his sentence pronounced, he said to Al-mu’tamed,  “©«Thou wilt not do this, for I will redeem myself with my weight in gold;’  “‘to which Al-mu’tamed replied, ‘By Allah! wert thou to give me possession.  ‘* of Africa and Andalus, I would not take it [as a ransom for thy life].2 The Jew  “ was accordingly nailed to a stake, [and the Christians of his suite sent to prison].  ‘“The news of this occurrence soon reached the ears of the Christian (king],  ‘‘ who wrote immediately to Al-mu’tamed, demanding the release of his prisoners ;  ‘* a request which was readily granted.   ‘* However, the Christian [king] swore to assemble an army as numerous as the  ‘“‘ hairs upon his head, and such as would enable him to penetrate to the Straits  “of Gibraltar. This was about the time when the commander of the Moslems,  “‘ Yusuf Ibn Tashefin, was occupied in the siege of Ceuta ; upon which Al-mu’tamed  “* [fearing lest Alfonso should put his threat into execution] crossed over to Africa,  “‘and had an interview with the Amir of the Almoravides, who promised him  ‘his help. Al-mu’tamed then returned to Andalus, and stimulated the Moslem  ‘‘ rulers of that country to make war against the infidels. Then came the landing  “of Yusuf [with his army], and the celebrated campaign of Zalékah, in which  “the unbelievers were most completely defeated; after which, Yusuf returned  ‘* [to his African dominions]. He came a second time, when Al-mu’tamed began to  ‘* suspect that his intention in taking possession of the country was to seize on the  “nut and leave the shell; and he was not mistaken; for Yusuf had formed the  ‘* design of depriving the rulers of Andalus of their states, for which end he began  “to plan all manner of stratagems.. He sent from Ceuta to ask Al-mu’tamed to  “« give up to him the city and port of Jeziratu-l-khadhr4 (Algesiras) ; a request which  “ Al-mu’tamed refused to grant him under various pretences. However, in the  “* twinkling of an eye, one hundred sail made their appearance before Algesiras ;  “upon which Yezid, son of Al-mu’tamed, who commanded there, let loose some  “* pigeons to apprize his father of the occurrence. Al-mu’tamed then ordered him  ‘* to give up the island; which he did, Ytisuf soon after taking possession of it.  “ This was not the first time that Yusuf had done so; for it is asserted that,  ‘“* whenever he crossed over to Andalus, he insisted upon being made the master  “of that place, and that even when he crossed for the first time, he would not  ‘embark until Al-mu’tamed had agreed to put him in possession of that port,  ‘as a security to himself. It is also asserted that Yusuf did this at the instiga-  ‘ tion and by the advice of some Andalusians.   “ After this, Yusuf determined upon making war against the rulers of Andalus,  “‘ and dispossessing them one by one of their states. To this end he sent from  “* Africa bodies of troops under the command of officers of his court, with instruc-",291,book_7,
"    254 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book viI.    “tions to besiege them [in their capitals]. In this manner he sent [an army] to  “besiege Al-mu’tamed in Seville. It must be observed that the inhabitants of  ‘that city were tired of that prince’s rule, and that the love which they had  “ always professed for the Beni ’Abbdd had been changed into hatred and contempt,  ‘‘ owing to several reasons, but chiefly because Al-mu’tamed was well known to  ‘indulge in many reprehensible excesses, such as the drinking of spirituous  ‘‘ liquors, and listening to music and the singing of female slaves. About this  “time, therefore, the generality of the people of Seville wished to get rid of  “« Al-mu’tamed as soon as possible. When Al-mu’tamed saw himself reduced  ‘to the last extremity, he sent to implore the assistance of the Christians; but  ‘‘(the general of] Yusuf having detached a division of his army to attack them  “on the road to Seville, they were defeated and their designs frustrated. After  “‘ this, Yusuf equipped a fleet in Africa, and sent it to blockade Seville, the siege  ‘of which was pressed with more vigour than ever. All this time Al-mu’tamed  ‘* was plunged in pleasure, and had intrusted the government (of his kingdom]  “to his son Ar-rashid; the consequence was, that, when he least expected,  “the Almoravides were within Seville. At last, hearing that the enemy were  ‘already in possession of part of the city, Al-mu’tamed awoke from his dream,  ‘and roused himself up from his intoxication. He mounted a horse, armed  ‘himself with a scimitar, and, dressed as he was, without any defensive armour,  “he rushed, followed by a few slaves, upon the Almoravides, who had just pene-  ‘trated into Seville by the gate of Al-faraj (Babu-l-faraj). Advancing upon a  ‘“drum which they had with them, he cut it in twain with his scimitar, and then  “ [sword in hand] he attacked the enemy, who fied before him in great confusion,  “* throwing themselves down from the top of the ramparts. Al-mu’tamed remained  “on the spot until the gate was built up; alluding to which, these two verses  ‘* were composed, which begin thus:  ‘ If the people have plundered the enemy.’   “‘ When the breach had been repaired and the gate stopped, Al-mu’tamed went  “to inspect the rest of the fortifications. When he arrived at the gate of the  ‘‘ dyers (Babu-s-sabbaghin), he found his son Malek stretched dead upon the  “‘ ground; and having implored the mercy of God upon him, he retired to his  “castle. Affairs soon grew worse, and the enemy entered the city on every  ‘* side; upon which, Al-mu’tamed, having previously asked security for himself  “and those who were with him, surrendered himself to the general of the Al-  ‘* moravides, who furnished him with vessels to cross over to Tangiers. Al-mu’tamed  ‘‘ was there met by a poet named Al-hosri, who had some time previous written  “* and dedicated to him a work containing selections from the best poets. Al-hosri    ",292,book_7,
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 255    “* was very far from imagining that he would ever see Al-mu’tamed in such a spot  ‘* and in such a plight, and presented the book to him. Al-mu’tamed took it into  ‘his hands, and said to the poet, ‘ Lift up that rug, and take whatever thou  “‘ mayst find under it; by Allah! I have nothing else to give thee.’ Al-hosri did  “as he was directed, and found a quantity of gold. After this, Al-mu’tamed was  “* conveyed to Aghmat, where he was kept prisoner for the rest of his days. He  “died in 488 (a.p. 1095). Al-mu’tamed had several sons, four of whom held  “empire, namely, Al-mamin, Ar-rashid, Ar-radhi, and Al-mu’tamed.”    One of the most powerful among the petty dynasties which rose out of the ruins Toledo.    of the Khalifate was that of the Beni Dhi-n-ntn, kings of Toledo, in the northern  Thagher. This family were at one time in possession of a powerful empire, and  their ostentation and luxurious habits reached an extreme point. From them  were named the nuptial feasts known in the West as the I’dhdru-dh-dhinint (the  wedding-feasts of the Beni Dhi-n-ntin), and which, owing to their magnificence  and the profusion and splendour with which they were attended, have become as  proverbial among the people of the West as the nuptials of Buran are among the  Eastern people. The first sovereign of this family, who reigned in Toledo, was  Isma’il, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ibn ’Omar Ibn Dhi-n-niin, the descendant in a  right line from As-samh Ibn Dhi-n-ntin, a Berber of the tribe of Howdrah, who  was present at the conquest [of Andalus].””   He was succeeded by his son Yahya, surnamed Al-mémiin, he who gave the en-  tertainments above alluded to, and became in time one of the most powerful among  the petty kings of Andalus. This Al-mémiin had some communication and dealings  with the tyrant Alfonso, which are well known. He took Cordova from the  hands of Al-mu’tamed Ibn ’Abbdd, and killed Abi ’Amru, the son of that monarch,  as we shall hereafter relate. He also gained possession of Valencia, and deprived  Ibn Abi ’A’mir of the sovereignty of that place. During the reign of a grandson”  of this Al-mamtin, by name Al-kadir Ibn Dhi-n-ntin, the tyrant Alfonso took  the city of Toledo from the Moslems ; for, finding his own power increased through  the extinction of the Khalifate, and perceiving the weak and helpless state to which  the Arabs had been reduced by their sins, he overran and plundered the flat  country, and so pressed Al-kddir that he obliged him to surrender his capital,  Toledo, in the year 478 (a. p. 1085), on condition, however, that he should assist  him in gaining possession of Valencia ; which he did. There is no power or strength  but in God, the Great! the High!   At the time that the power of the Beni ’A’mir was overthrown in Cordova,  and the usurper Al-muhdi was’ reigning in their room, Al-mundhir Ibn Yahya  At-tojibi, a descendant of the Tojibites, who played so distinguished a part during    Saragossa.",293,book_7,

At his death  he was succeeded by his son Yahya, who was soon after’ dethroned by Suleyman  Ibn Ahmed Ibn Mohammed Ibn Hiid Al-jodh4mi, who took the surname of Al-  musta’tn-billah (he who expects the assistance of God).   The most renowned princes of this dynasty were Abt Ja’far Ahmed Ibn Hid, sur-    ‘named Al-muktadir-billah (the powerful by the grace of God), son of the preceding,    who died ig a.H. 474 (beginning June 10, a. p. 1081), and his son, Abi ’A’mir Yusuf  Al-mutamen (the trusty). The latter was so much addicted to the study of mathe-  matics, that he composed, among other works on that science, one entitled Kitdbu-l-  istikmdl wa-l-manddhir (perfection and observatories).** He died the same year  that Toledo was taken (a. u. 478, a.p. 1085), and was succeeded by his son  Al-musta’in > Ahmed, who lost the battle of Huesca in 489 (a.p. 1096). After  the death of this prince, who fell a martyr for the faith in an engagement with the  Christians in sight of Saragossa, in 503 (a.p. 1110), his son ’Abdu-l-malek, sur-  named Imddu-d-daulah (the column of the state), succeeded to the kingdom of  Saragossa. The Christian king [Ramiro] having taken from him his capital  in 512 (a.p. 1118), he was compelled to retire to a strong fortress* in his  dominions, where he maintained himself until he died. He was succeeded by his  son Seyfu-d-daulah (the sword of the state), who fought many a hard battle with  the Christian tyrant, until he made an agreement with him, and removed with  his family to Toledo, where he died.   Among the verses of A#muktadir some have been preserved in which he praises  two palaces which he had erected in his capital ; one called Kasru-s-sorir (the abode  of joy), and the other Mejless adh-dhahab (the gilded hall). During the sway of  the Almohades, a prince of this family, named Mohammed Ibn Yusuf Ibn Hid  Al-jodh4mi, raised the standard of revolt, and made himself master of the greater  part of Andalus; but enough will be said of him in another part of this  work.   The city of Badajoz and its district fell likewise to the share of a powerful  family, who maintained themselves in possession of their usurped dominions  until the arrival of the Almoravides. It was formerly in the hands of Shabir,  a eunuch of the Beni ’A’mir, who, immediately upon the assassination of  ’Abdu-r-rahmdn and the dethronement of Hishdm [by Mohammed Al-muhdi],  declared himself independent, assuming the title of Hajib (chamberlain) and  the surname of Al-manstir. At his death the government of Badajoz and its  districts passed into the hands of Al-mudhaffer** [Mohammed Ibn Al-afttas],  the author of the work entitled Al-mudhaffert, in fifty volumes. He was suc-  ceeded by his son ""Omar, surnamed Al-mutawakkel-billah (he who relies on         ",294,book_7,

In commemoration of that unfortunate  event, Ibn ’Abdiin wrote his celebrated elegiac poem, the beginning of which we  have given elsewhere (vol. i. p. 62): it is one of the finest poems that ever  was written.   Valencia and the surrounding districts were in the hands of Abii-l-hasan ’Abdu-l- Valencia.  ’aziz Al-ma’éferi, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmdén, and grandson of Abt ’A’mir Al-mansir.  He was succeeded by his son ’Abdu-l-malek, surnamed Al-mudhaffer,* who was  deprived of his kingdom by his father-in-law, Yahya Al-m4min, King of Toledo.   Murcia was in the mean while under the sway of a family called the Beni Tahir, Murcis.  who ruled undisturbed over that city and the neighbouring districts for a period  of several years, until they were finally dispossessed of their dominions by Al-  mu’tamed Ibn ’Abbdd, King of Seville.   Almeria was governed in succession by a great number of princes. The first Almeria.  was the Sclavonian eunuch Khayrdn, who, as before stated, had been governor of  the province during the administration of the Hajib Abi ’A’mir Al-manstr, and  who, at the overthrow of the dynasty of Umeyyah, raised the standard of revolt  against the sovereigns of the house of Hamid. At his death, which happened in  419 (beginning Jan. 30, a. p. 1028), Khayrdn was succeeded by another Sclavonian  eunuch, named Zohayr,*” who added to his dominions the city of Xatiba and other  populous districts. This Zohayr was slain in 429 (beginning Oct. 13, a. p. 1037),  in a battle fought under the walls of Granada with the troops of Badis, King of  that city. At his death, the kingdom of Almeria passed into the hands of Dhi-l-  wizdrateyn Abi-l-ahwass Ma’n Ibn Samddeh, who bequeathed it to his son Mo-  hammed Abi Yahya. This was an enlightened and excellent monarch; he  governed his states with great wisdom and justice, until the arrival of the wearers  of the veil (Almoravides), who, having laid siege to his capital, took it from his  son Ahmed, he himself dying during the siege.   The [Balearic] islands were governed by Mujahid Ibn ’Abdillah Al-’4miri, sur-  named Abi-I-jiyish (the father of the army) and <Al-muwaffek (he who prospers  by the grace of God), a mauli of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, son of Al-manstr. At the  death of his master, Mujahid kept possession of Denia [of which city he was  governor], and became in time King of the Balearic® islands. He was an un-  daunted warrior and an experienced sailor. He used to keep a considerable fleet  always ready for sea, with which he made descents on the coast of Afranj (France),  and Antaliah (Italy).

These he subdued, keeping the inhabitants under his obedience.  “ From thence, having equipped a fleet, Mujahid sailed to Sardinia, a large island  ‘of the Rim, which he almost entirely conquered. This happened in the year  “406 or 407 (a.p. 1015-17). Soon after, however, discord broke out among  ‘“‘ his men; upon which the Rim, having received re-inforcements, attacked Mujahid  ‘and sank some of his ships. In order to save the remainder, Mujahid set sail  “against the advice of experienced mariners, and the consequence was that the  ‘* greater part of his vessels were either dashed against the rocks or lost at sea.” —  “T was told,” says Al-homaydi, “by Abi Mohammed ’Ali Ibn Ahmed [Ibn  “ Hazm], who held it from Abi-l-fotih Thabit Ibn Mohammed Al-jorjéni, who  “‘ accompanied Mujahid to the conquest of Sardinia, that the latter entered with  “his fleet a port against the advice of Abi Khartf, the chief of the sailors,  ‘‘ who warned him not to go in. Scarcely, however, had the fleet entered the  “bay, when a storm arose, which scattered and separated the vessels of the  ‘“* Moslems, and cast them on shore, where the Christians were lying in wait ;  ** so that they had nothing to do but to slay and make captives [of the Moslems]  “at their pleasure.”   Mujéhid returned to the Andalusian [or Balearic] islands, and some time after  took possession of the city of Denia,** wherein he fixed his residence until he died  in 436. After the death of Mujahid, his son ’Ali succeeded him in his dominions ;  but soon after a freed slave of his father, named Mubashsher,*” took possession  of the [Balearic] islands and reigned over them under the name of Nasiru-d-  . daulah. It was in the days of the latter that the Christians made a descent on  the island of Mallorca, and subjected it to their rule, although it was recovered  not long after by the Moslems. ’Ali, however, continued to rule“’ over Denia  and the neighbouring districts until he was expelled by the Almoravides.   Besides the above-mentioned chieftains, who divided among themselves the  inheritance of the Beni Umeyyah, there were many other governors who assumed  the sovereignty in the small districts and towns over which they ruled. Such  were Habib, a Sclavonian eunuch, brother of Shabir, King of Badajoz, who ruled  for some time over Tortosa and the adjacent districts.   That portion of Andalus known under the name of As-sahlah was erected into  a kingdom by Dhi-r-riydsateyn ’Abidid*? Ibn Razin, a Berber chief attached to the  party of the Benf ’A’mir.

Origin of the Asturian kingdom—Progress of the Christian arms—Taking of Toledo by Alfonso VI.—  Conquests of Sancho I. of Aragon—Battle of Paterna—Taking of Barbastro—Massacre of the in-  habitante—Excesses committed by the Christians—Barbastro retaken by the Moslems—Ambitious  projects of Alfonso—His insolent request—A]l-mu’tamed puts to death his ambassador—Alfonso pre-  pares to revenge the outrage—Marches against Seville, and besieges it—Al-mu’tamed decides on  calling Yiisuf to his aid—Sends him an embassy—Account of Yusuf Ibn Téshefin—His negotiation  with the rulers of Andalus—His answer to the ambassadors of Al-mu’tamed.    pasa ie _ We have already stated, on the authority of several historians, (p. 34,) that the  dom. first Christian who, after the conquest of Andalus by the Arabs, collected his  countrymen round him and showed symptoms of resistance, was a barbarian named  Beldy (Pelayo), from among the people of Ashturish (Asturias) in Galicia, who,  during the administration of Al-horr Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Ath-thakef{, the second  governor of Andalus, fled from Cordova, where he was retained as an hostage  for the security of his countrymen, and repaired to his native mountains. This  event took place six years after the conquest of Andalus, that is to say, in the  year 98 of the Hijra. The Christians [of those parts], having taken up arms  with him against the lieutenant of Al-horr, expelled him from the country and  became masters of it. The historian ""Isa Ibn Ahmed Ar-rdzi! relates this dif-  ferently. He says: ‘In the days of ’Anbasah Ibn Sohaym Al-kelbf, [governor  ‘* of Andalus,] there rose in the land of Galicia a contemptible barbarian whose  ‘‘name was Beldy (Pelayo), and who was the first among the Christians to show  “ signs of resistance. This man began to stir up the Franks to keep the Moslems  “ out of those districts which remained still in their hands,? a thing for which they  “had never yet shown any inclination. The Moslems at that time were the  “masters of [almost] all Andalus, and they had expelled the Christians [from  “ those districts formerly occupied by them]. They had pushed their conquests as  ‘* far as Aritinah (Narbonne), which they took, and they had also reduced the city  “of Banbilinah [Pamplona] in Galicia; so that there remained nothing [in the  ‘hands of the Christians] but a ridge of mountains, to which they had fled. Here  “a prince, named Beldy (Pelayo), also took refuge with three hundred followers,  “‘ whom the Moslems ceased not to pursue and to attack, until the greater part",298,book_7,
"    CHAP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 261    ‘of them died of hunger, and Pelayo remained with only thirty men and ten  “* women, whose sole food consisted of honey which they gathered in the crevices  ‘of the rock. In this manner they supported themselves, until information [of  ‘“‘ their existence] was brought to the Moslems, who despised them and said,  “‘« What are thirty barbarians? They cannot but be destroyed, and we shall  “be rid of them;’ and yet their strength and numbers have since increased in  “such a ratio that it can no longer be concealed. This Pelayo died in the year  ‘* 133, (beginning August 8, a.p. 750,) after a reign of nineteen years, and was  ** succeeded by his son Fafilah (Favila), who reigned two years. Fafilah was  “succeeded by Adefonsh, son of Beytro or Pedro (Alfonso el Catdlico), the  “ progenitor of the [royal] family of the Alfonsos,? who are now reigning, and  ‘“‘ who have retaken what the Moslems had conquered of their country.”   So far Ar-rézi, whose narrative we have somewhat abridged. Other historians  state that the number of Christian kings who reigned in Andalus (since the rising  of Pelayo], to the end of An-ndsir’s reign in 350 (a. p. 961), was twenty-two.   The historian Al-mes’tidi, after relating the disastrous battle of Samtrah (Zamora), La atale 1  which, as is well known, was fought in the days of An-ndsir, says as follows: #™*  ‘‘ This victory gave to the Galicians and Basques the superiority over the Moslems,  ‘* as they took from them many towns on the frontiers of Afranjah (France), such  “as the city of Tarkinah (Tarragona),* which was lost to the Moslems in the year  ‘* 330, (beginning Sept. 25, a. p. 941,) and other important towns and castles, which  ‘‘ had been in their hands [since the conquest] ; so that at the moment we write,  ‘in a. H. 336, (beginning July 22, a. p. 947,) the Moslem frontier on the eastern  “side of Andalus is the city of Tortishah (Tortosa), and on that part of the  “coast of the Mediterranean which is in the vicinity of Tortosa going towards  ‘the north, the cities of Afraghah (Fraga), on the great river [Ebro], Léridah  “* (Lerida), and, lastly, Balaghi (Balaguer).”   Most of the conquests made by the Christians were, however, recovered under  the administration of the Hajib Al-mansir, who not only defeated the infidels  wherever he met them, but took also Barcelona in the East, and Santiago in  the West, both courts of their proudest kings. But alas! during the civil wars  into which Cordova was plunged soon after the death of Al-manstir,—when the  parties contending for power scrupled not to implore the assistance of the  Christians, and to admit them into the capital,—the cruel enemy of God again  raised his head with pride and exultation, and began to attack the Moslems, whose  weakness and folly he had witnessed. The division, too, of Andalus into several  petty kingdoms, which followed immediately after the overthrow of the house of  Umeyyah, afforded the Christians considerable facilities to execute their wicked",299,book_7,
"    Taking of  Toledo by  Alfonso VI.    262 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vil.    designs ; for, whilst they united their forces, and even invited the people of distant  nations to share in the attack, the Moslem rulers [of Andalus] saw with perfect  unconcern, perhaps with secret joy, the dominions of their neighbours or rivals  exposed to all the devastations of the Christian foe.   About the year 467, (a.p. 1074,) Adefunsh (Alfonso VI.), son of Ferdeland  (Fernando), united under his rule almost the whole of Christian Andalus. Being  a man of great resolution, and well acquainted with the pitiful state of Mohammedan  affairs, he formed the design of subjecting the whole country to his detestable  rule ; and for that purpose began to attack all those among the rulers [of Andalus]  who refused to pay him tribute. Accordingly, he invaded the dominions of the  King of Toledo, and, after seven years’ siege, made himself master of that capital  in the year 474 (beginning June 10, a.p. 1081). There are, however, various  dates given for the loss of that city; some authors saying that it happened in  474 (a. p. 1081), as above stated; whilst others assert that it surrendered to the  Christians on the 15th day of Moharram of the year 478 (May 12, a.p. 1085).  Ibn Khallekén, [in the life of Yusuf Ibn Tdshefin,] says, in the new moon of  Safar of the same year [478] (May 28, a.p. 1085,) after a long siege; Ibn  ’Alkamah, on Wednesday the 20th of Moharram, a. u. 478 (May 17, a. p. 1085) ;  and he adds that the battle of Zalakah was fought the year after. Be this as it  may, certain it is that the King of Toledo at the time was Al-kadir-billah [grand-]  son of Al-m4min Yahya Ibn Dhi-n-nin, who, in return for the capital of his  dominions which he gave up to Alfonso, received from that monarch the promise  that he would help him to get possession of Valencia; which he did.   ‘* Toledo,” says one of the historians [of Andalus], ‘‘ was a very ancient and  “ strongly fortified city, full of primeval buildings of the time of the ’Amalekites  ‘“‘ (Phoenicians or Carthaginians), who were its founders. It is situated on the  “banks of a large river called Tajoh (Tagus), has a kassdbah or citadel of mar-  “vellous strength, and a bridge of wonderful structure, consisting of only one  “arch, through which the stream passes with great rapidity and force. Close  “to the banks of the river is a nd’irah or water-wheel, rising to the height of  “ ninety cubits, by means of which the water of the river is made to ascend to  “the bridge, and is from thence conveyed, by means of subterraneous pipes, to  “ the city, for the use of the inhabitants.” In times of old, Toledo was the court  and residence of the ancient monarchs of Andalus ; it was there that the enchanted  palace was, which the Gothic kings warned each other not to open, until Roderic  opened it and found inside the picture of the Arabs, as we have related elsewhere  (vol. i. p. 262).   After the overthrow of the dynasty of Umeyyah, and when the governors, chiefs,",300,book_7,
"    CHAP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 263    and other influential men of Andalus divided among themselves its provinces,  Toledo and the neighbouring districts were occupied by the family of Dhi-n-nin,  one of whom was Yahya Ibn Isma’il, surnamed Al-mémiin, who became in his  time one of the most powerful kings of Andalus. He not only took Cordova from  the Beni ’Abbad, but made himself formidable to the other kings of Andalus by his  power and his resources.   Ibn Bedriin, in his commentary upon the ’Abdiniyyah, speaks of a palace built  at Toledo by this Al-m4min [Yahya] Ibn Dhi-n-niin, in the construction of which  that monarch is reported to have lavished his treasures. He made a lake, and  in the middle of the lake a kiosk [of crystal], to the top of which the water of  the lake was made to ascend by geometrical art, and then fall down on all sides to  mix itself with the water underneath. The pavilion was therefore enclosed within a  shower of limpid water, which, being constantly renewed, was kept always cool,  and Al-mdémin would sit inside the pavilion without the water touching him;  he could, moreover, have wax-tapers lighted within, if he chose. One day, as he  was sitting in this pavilion, he heard a voice, saying,   ‘« Thou hast erected everlasting palaces ; but thy dwelling in them will be of  ‘* short duration.   “ The ardk affords sufficient shade to the traveller who is daily exposed to  “ the rays of a scorching sun.” ®   Some time after this adventure Al-m4miin fell ill and died.   Al-mdémin was succeeded by his [grand-]son, Yahya Al-kddir, under whose reign,  as above stated, Toledo was reduced by Alfonso. It is generally related, that the  Christian king remained for seven consecutive years encamped before the city,  destroying the fields and plantations, cutting down the trees, and intercepting the  supplies sent by other Moslem princes, until Al-k4dir consented to surrender the  city to him upon certain conditions which Alfonso swore to fulfil.   Thus fell the city of Toledo. Ibn Dhi-n-niin [Al-kédir] left his capital in the  most wretched and ignominious plight possible. He carried an astrolabe in his  hand, with which he intended to take the auspicious hour for setting out [for  Valencia]. At the sight of such behaviour the Moslems were dumb with as-  tonishment, and the unbelievers laughed with contempt.   About the taking of Toledo we find the following in Ibn Bessim: “At the  ‘time that civil wars were succeeding each other in Toledo, and that dire calamities  “‘ were daily being heaped on the inhabitants of that place, when the Franks were  “ striving to convert their happiness and their joy into misfortune and exile, there  ‘happened in Toledo a most marvellous circumstance, which was looked upon  “‘ by every one as the harbinger of its approaching ruin. Corn had remained",301,book_7,

Yet when it  “came to the year in which the enemy of God took possession of Toledo, the  ** corn began gradually to grow damaged, and corruption at last seized the whole  ‘of it. This miraculous occurrence warned the citizens of Toledo that it was  “ the will of God to visit them with the gales of affliction and adversity; and  ‘go it was; for, shortly after, the enemy of God took Toledo, and reduced the  ‘* inhabitants of that wealthy city to his obedience.”   “ Alfonso,” continues Ibn Bess4m; “‘ began to govern the people with justice  “and moderation, hoping to gain them over to polytheism, and make ‘them  ““embrace his abominable religion; but, seeing that he could not accomplish  ‘this, he set about polluting the principal mosque and turning it into a church -  ‘for the celebration of his detestable rites. The very day in which Alfonso  “issued his orders to that effect, which was one day of the month of Rabi’  “ the first, a.u. 496, (Oct. 14, a.p. 1102,)° the Sheikh Al-mogh4mi (may God  “show him mercy!) happened to go into the mosque and to say his prayers,  ‘* bidding all those who were present to do the same, and to read a certain chapter  “of the Koran. Presently the Franks (may God Almighty exterminate them all!)  “‘ make their appearance in the mosque and begin to pull down the kiblah. Not  “one of them, however, dared interrupt the Sheikh in his devotions, or expel  “him from the mosque; God protecting him and the pious Moslems who were  ‘“‘ with him, until he had finished reading his prayers, and had performed a  “« prostration, when he raised his head and wept profusely before he quitted the  ‘* mosque.”   One day, a traitor Moslem said to the Christian king, ‘“‘ Thou shouldst put  “on a crown like those of thy ancestors, who preceded thee in this kingdom ;”  and he answered, ‘‘ Not until we have taken your city, Cordova, and taken the  ‘“‘ bells which hang there as lamps, that I may ornament my royal diadem with  “them.” God, however, was pleased to give Alfonso the lie, sending against him  the commander of the Moslems and defender of the faith, Yusuf Ibn Téshefin,  to prop up the tottering edifice of Islim, and to humble the pride of the insolent  Christian.   But whilst the Galicians were assailing the Moslems on their northern frontier,  the Franks (Aragonese) were not inactive. In the year 456 (beginning Dec. 24,  A.D. 1063) they collected in large numbers and laid siege to Valencia, whose  inhabitants were then untrained to war, and as little used to the hard life of a",302,book_7,

They were, on the contrary,  plunged in pleasure and sloth, and thought of nothing but eating and drinking.  At this juncture the Franks appeared in sight of the city, showing an inclination  to become the guests of the Moslems, to join their convivial parties, and to  take up their abode in the city. In this hope, however, they were completely  disappointed, and, although they tried to deceive the inhabitants, they were  themselves deceived. At last they retired from before the walls of Valencia;  upon which the citizens, thinking that they were flying before them, went out  in large numbers to attack the enemy, commanded by their king, ’Abdu-]-’aziz Ibn  Abi ’A’mir, and arrayed in all their finery. ThggFranks, however, had only retreated  to a short distance from Valencia, to a plée called Paterna, where they lay in  ambush. No sooner had ’Abdu-l-’aziz and his host made their appearance than  they rushed upon them, threw their ranks into confusion, and, following up the  puféuit, slew or took prisoners all the Moslems, with the exception of a few. In  allusion to this, a poet of that time composed two verses, which we have given  elsewhere (vol. i. p. 68), and need not repeat here.”   The same thing, observes Ibn Bessém, happened afterwards to the people of  Toledo; for when the enemies of God, after slaying numbers of the Moslems in  a battle, showed themselves before their city, the citizens came out to them dressed  in all their finery, and were defeated. Among the spoils made by the Christians  on this occasion were no less than one thousand ghifdrah,® besides other [useless]  articles of dress.   In the year 456 (a.p. 1064), the Christians took the city of Barbashter Taking of Bar-  (Barbastro), one of the strongest places in all the Thagher (Aragon). Tbou  Hayyan calls it the kassdbah (citadel) of the country of Birtanieh,® and says that  it was close to Saragossa. Its capture is thus related by the above historian:   “The army of Al-ardemelis © encamped before Barbastro and besieged it. Yusuf  “ Tbn Suleymén Ibn Htid [at that time King of Saragossa], instead of hastening,  ‘“as he ought to have done, to the relief of the city, left the inhabitants to defend  ‘“‘ themselves as they best could; and the consequence was that the enemy got  “‘ possession of it, as we will presently relate. The Christians besieged it for  “ forty consecutive days without gaining any advantage, until, having received  ‘* intelligence that the garrison were divided and had quarrelled among themselves,  ‘‘ owing to the scarcity of provisions, they pressed their attacks with increased  “‘ vigour, and succeeded in introducing five thousand of their best men at arms  “into the suburbs. The Moslems were astounded, and betook themselves to  “the inner city, where they fortified themselves. Great battles then ensued  “‘ between the’ two hosts, in which no less than five hundred Franks fell. At last  VOL. I. , 2M    Battle of  Paterna.",303,book_7,
"    Massacre ofthe  inhabitants.    266 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK VII.    “it happened that the subterraneous aqueduct, by means of which the city was  “ supplied with water from the river, got out of repair; several large stones having  “fallen into and choked the course, the progress of the water was arrested, and  “the supply cut off from the river. Upon which the inhabitants of Barbastro,  “ despairing of their lives, hastened to the camp of the enemy, and bought security  “for their persons and property at the price of certain sums of money, and a  “ number of slaves, which they immediately delivered into the conqueror’s hands.  ‘* No sooner, however, had the Christian king received the money and other articles  ‘ stipulated in the convention, than he violated it; and, falling on the poor  ‘inhabitants, slaughtered the whole of them, with the exception of the Kayed  “ Tbnu-t-tawil, and the Kédi Ibn ‘Isa, who, with a few more of the principal  ‘inhabitants of the place, contrived to escape from the general massacre. The  ‘* spoil made by the Christians on this occasion, whether in money, furniture,  “or apparel, exceeds all computation; since we are assured that the share of  “one of their chiefs only, who was the general of the cavalry,"" amounted to  “* about fifteen hundred young maidens, besides five hundred loads of merchandise,  ‘* dresses, ornaments, and every description of property, the whole of which he  “carried to his stronghold. The number of Moslems who perished or were  ‘‘made captives on this occasion amounted to one hundred thousand souls ;  “although others reduce that number to about one-half.   “« Among the extraordinary occurrences of this siege, the following is one. At  ‘the time when the aqueduct got out of repair, and the supply of water was  “ cut off from the city, there was a woman standing on the ramparts, who entreated  “all those who came near to give her a sip of water for herself or her son.  “« Presently a Christian soldier made his appearance, and told her that if she would  “* give him every thing she had on,—dress, jewels, &c.,—he would bring her some  ‘* water wherewithal to quench her thirst; and the woman did not hesitate one  ‘* moment to accept the bargain.   ‘‘The reason which induced the Christian king to order the massacre of the  “inhabitants was this. They say that when he entered Barbastro and saw the  “ numbers of the population, fear lodged in his heart, and he became apprehensive  “Jest the Moslems of the neighbouring districts should come to their assistance,  “and aid them to regain possession of their city. He therefore decided on  “« exterminating them all, if he could, and ordered a general slaughter ; which lasted  “until upwards of six thousand Moslems fell by the swords of the Christians.  “ At last the king ordered the massacre to cease, and commanded that such of the  “« inhabitants as remained should be spared, and allowed to quit the city. When the  ‘ order was made public, the rush of the people to the gate [of the city] was such    ",304,book_7,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 267    ‘ that a considerable number of them lost their lives by suffocation; others were  ‘* wiser, they let themselves down from the walls by means of ropes ; all, however,  ‘ran to the river in order to quench their thirst. About seven hundred of the  “ principal inhabitants of the place, fearing for their lives, waited until their fate  “should be known. When the massacre had ceased, and the Christians had  “ taken as many captives as they wanted, and the remainder had either fled through  “the gates, or let themselves down from the walls, or perished in the pressure,  ‘it was announced by the public crier that the slaughter had ended, and that  “ every citizen might return in safety to his dwelling; then they left their place of  “ concealment and hastened home to their families. No sooner, however, had they  “‘ arrived there, than, by the command of their king, the Franks (may the curses  “ of God fall on their heads!) summoned them out of their houses, and led them  ‘all into captivity with their wives and children. May the Almighty save us from  ‘“a similar calamity ! ;   ‘Another portion of the inhabitants fled to the top of the neighbouring  “‘ mountains, and fortified themselves there; but, being destitute of water, they  ‘‘ were on the point of dying of thirst, when messengers arrived from the king  “‘ to grant them security and pardon. They then came down from the mountains  “more dead than alive, owing to the raging thirst to which they had long been  “‘ exposed, and were allowed to proceed unmolested wherever they pleased ; but  “ having fallen in with a party of the enemy’s cavalry, who were not aware of  “« the truce entered into with them, they were all put to death with the exception of  “‘ a few who contrived to escape.”   The same writer adds, “It was an invariable custom with the Christians, Excesses com-  ‘“ whenever they took a town by force of arms, to ravish the daughters in the eee  “‘ presence of their fathers, and the women before the eyes of their husbands and  ‘families. But on the taking of Barbastro the excesses of this kind committed  “by them pass all belief ;!? the Moslems had never before experienced any thing  ‘like it. In short, such were the crimes and excesses committed by the Christians  ‘* on this occasion, that there is no pen eloquent enough to describe them.   ‘* When the Christian king had made up his mind to return to his own country,  ‘‘he selected from among the sons and daughters of the Moslems the most beau-  “ tiful maidens and the handsomest boys; and having also selected from among  ‘the married women those who were the youngest and prettiest, he sent them  ‘* onwards to his capital, intending to present them to his superiors in rank and  “‘ dignity.

Some time after  “this catastrophe, a Jewish merchant went to Barbastro for the purpose .of  “‘ redeeming the daughter of one of the principal inhabitants, who had escaped  ‘from the massacre. At the division of the spoil, the maiden had fallen to the  “lot of a count, whom the Jew well knew, one of those left in charge of the city  “after the king’s departure]. The Jew went to the count’s residence, and,  “ causing himself to be announced by the servants, was admitted into his presence.  “ He there found the Christian occupying the part of the house where its late  ‘“‘ Moslem proprietor usually sat; reclining on his very couch, and clothed in his  ‘© most valuable robes. The room, however, with its carpets, cushions, and  “* hangings, was in the same state as when its owner left it on the fatal day; and  “ nothing had been changed or touched of its [arabesque] paintings and ornaments.  “ His female slaves, with their hair tied, were all standing by his bed-side, ready to  “ obey his will.   “‘ The count,” said the Jew, ‘‘ welcomed me, and inquired the object of my visit;  ‘‘ which I told him plainly and without disguise, pointing to the many maidens  ‘* who were in the room, and in whose number was the one I came to redeem.  ‘“ The count smiled, and said to me, in the language of his nation, ‘ Be quick, then,  ‘‘ and if the girl thou seekest be among these, point her out to me; if not, thou  “‘mayst go to my castle, where thou wilt find many more among my prisoners  ‘‘ and captives ; look for the person thou meanest,—we will then come to terms.’  “ T replied, ‘ I need not repair to thy castle, the person in search of whom I am  ‘* come is among yonder maidens ; if thou consentest to part with her, I am ready  “to meet thy demands.’—‘ And what hast thou brought to tempt me?’ said the  “count. ‘I have brought thee fine gold in quantity, and costly and new mer-  “‘ chandise,’ was my answer. ‘And thou, no doubt, flatterest thyself that thou  “hast brought things to tempt me, and which I do not possess already..

But what was my astonishment when the Christian told  “‘ me that what I saw was but a small portion of the treasures which he possessed,  “and that he had so many other precious articles of all sorts, that nothing could  ‘be produced which was either new or desirable to him. He then swore by his  ‘* God, that had he possessed none of the valuable objects [exhibited] before me,  ‘and had I come for the express purpose of offering them to him as a ransom  “for the fair captive, he would still not part with her; and he added, ‘ This  “ maiden is the daughter of the late owner of this house, who, if I am rightly  “informed, was a man of rank and influence among his fellow-citizens; and  “‘ for this reason I intend to keep her in my service, as the people of her nation  ‘“‘ were wont to do with our women, whenever they fell into their hands, at  “the time that they were all-powerful in this country. Now that the scales are  “ turned, and that we have the superiority over them, we do as they did; nay,  ‘“we do still more. Seest thou yonder youthful and delicate maiden (pointing  “to one who stood in a corner of the room with a lute in her hand), she is  “actually trembling from fear of my anger.’—‘ Take thy lute,’ said he to her in  ‘his barbarous jargon, ‘and sing to this our visitor in thy plaintive strain.’ The  “* maid took the lute, as she was commanded, and sat down to tune it; and I saw  “the tears rolling down her fair cheeks; but, the Christian darting upon her a  “look of anger, she attempted to sing some verses which I did not understand  “any more than her Christian master; although, strange to say, he kept drinking  ‘“‘ draughts of the liquor he had before him, and giving signs of mirth [as if he  “understood the meaning of them]. At last, seeing that I could not gain my  ‘* object, I took leave of the count, and went elsewhere [about the city] to dispose  ‘* of my goods, when I saw in the hands of the commonest Christians such amount  ‘* of plunder and captives as left me completely bewildered.    “« About the end of Jumdada, the first, of the ensuing, year (a.

The loss of the unbelievers  ‘‘ was very considerable, since it amounted to one thousand horsemen and five  “hundred foot. The city was purified from the filth of idolatry, and cleansed  “from the stains of infidelity and polytheism.”   But to return. No sooner did the tyrant Alfonso see himself master of Toledo,  and of all those towns which had formerly acknowledged the rule of Al-kddir Ibn  Dhi-n-niin, than he began to entertain the project of reducing the whole of Andalus  under his sway. He accordingly made successive incursions into the territory of  Ibn Al-afttas, King of Badajoz, as well as into that of Al-mu’tamed Ibn ’Abbéd, at  that time King of Seville, taking so many of their towns and castles, and causing  such havoc and ruin, that those monarchs, together with many other petty princes,  consented to pay an annual tribute to Alfonso, rather than have their dominions  continually exposed to his devastating fury.   What follows is extracted from the Raudhu-l-mw’attar ft dhikri-m-modon wa-l-  akttdr, by the Faquih Abt ’Abdillah Tbn ’Abdillah Ibn ’Abdi-l-mu’anem Al-himyari.  ** Whilst Al-mu’tamed was occupied in making war against Ibn Samédeh, King of  ‘* Almeria, he let pass the time at which he used to pay his annual tribute to Al-  “ fonso. However, he sent it to him as usual ; but the Christian king was so highly  “ displeased and incensed [at the delay], that he would not receive it, and required  “that Al-mu’tamed should, in addition [to the tribute], give up to him certain  ‘fortresses which he named. He went still further; he asked that his wife,  “ Alkomjittah (Constanza ?), who was then with child, should be allowed to  “reside in the great mosque of Cordova, that she might be delivered [in that  ‘sacred spot]. Alfonso was induced to make this extraordinary request at the    ",308,book_7,

He asked, therefore,  “‘ that his wife should be allowed to reside at Medinah Az-zahra, a city west of  “ Cordova, built by An-nésir lidin-illah, who expended much time and treasure  ‘in its construction, ornamenting it with the most costly rarities, with coloured  ‘* jaspers and transparent marbles, as well as with the far-famed [marble] fountain  ‘« resting on a single pillar, which he caused to be brought to Cordova from distant  ‘lands, and in the acquisition of which he is said to have spent immense sums,  ‘‘ without counting those spent in the transport [to Cordova], and the salary of  ‘‘the men employed [in the operation]. ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, moreover, laboured  “‘ himself in the building, watching its progress, and encouraging the workmen ;  “the pleasure which he derived from that occupation being so great, that he  “ once left off going to the mosque for three consecutive Fridays; and when he  “‘ appeared on the fourth, the austere theologian, Mundhir Ibn Sa’id Al-bolitti,  ‘« who was then the Khattib (preacher), alluded to him in his sermon, and, in the  “« presence of the assembled multitude, threatened him [with the fire of hell], as is  ‘* well known. The palace of Az-zahr4 was one of the most magnificent residences  ‘ever built by a king in the dominions of Islim. Those who wish for further  “ information may consult the work of Ibnu Hayydn.   “ But, to return to Alfonso. His physicians and priests advised him to procure al-mu’tamed  “a residence for his wife at Az-zahrd, in order that she might visit the mosque of puis to death  “ Cordova every day until the time of her delivery should come, thus combining the * “""°™  “ salubrity and amenity of the spot with the sanctity and virtues of the place where  “‘ she was expected to be confined. The bearer of the message was a Jew, who was  “one of Alfonso’s ministers. As may be presumed, Al-mu’tamed indignantly  “* refused to grant his indecent request. The Jew insisted, but the King of Seville  “ replied that he would never consent to it. Again the Jew repeated his demand  ‘a third time, treating Al-mu’tamed in a very indecorous manner, and using  ‘ language which that spirited monarch could not well brook ; upon which, being  “ unable to bear his impudence any longer, he seized an inkstand, which was close  “by him, and hurled it at the head of the Jew. The missile was aimed with  “such dexterity, and directed with such force, that it lodged in the skull of the  “ Jew, whose brain fell down his throat. After this, Al-mu’tamed ordered that  ‘the Jew should be nailed to a post, with his head downwards, at the entrance  “« of the bridge of Cordova; which was done as he commanded.   ‘* When Al-mu’tamed’s anger was cooled, he sent for his theologians, in order to",309,book_7,

Mohammed then told  ‘his comrades, ‘I have hastened to give him my advice, from fear he should not  ‘* persevere in his laudable purpose of opposing the enemy, and not permitting  ‘* Alfonso to inflict such an affront upon the Moslems.’ ”   The above is differently related by Ibnu-l-lebbanah, in his history of the Bent  *Abbad, as well as by Ibnu-l-khattib'® in the article ‘Al-mu’tamed.’ We here  subjoin a third version, borrowed from the historian Ibnu-l-athir, in his Kémil  (complete history). ‘‘ Al-mu’tamed Ibn ’Abb4d was the most powerful king in  “* Andalus, and the one who possessed most dominions, being master of Cordova,  “ Seville, and other cities; yet with all this he paid tribute to Alfonso every  “ year. On the taking of Toledo by Alfonso, Al-mu’tamed, as usual, sent him  “ the tribute; but the Christian would not receive it, and wrote to him a threat-  “ening letter, saying, that unless he surrendered to him all his fortresses, and  “kept only the plains and the open towns for the Moslems, he would march  “ his army to Cordova and take that city [from him]. The ambassador intrusted  ‘“‘ with this message proceeded with a numerous suite, amounting to five hundred  ‘horsemen. Al-mu’tamed lodged him, and divided his followers among the  “ officers of his army, to whom he afterwards gave instructions to put every one  “ of their infidel guests to death ; which was executed according to his orders. He  “ then sent for the ambassador, and, seizing him by the throat, he shook him and  ‘* beat him until the eyes came out of his head. Three men only [out of the five  ‘‘ hundred] escaped the general massacre; they returned to Alfonso, and told him  “« what had happened. Alfonso was then on the road to Cordova, which he was  “‘ going to besiege; but when he heard the news brought to him, he returned  ‘‘ immediately to Toledo, to provide himself with battering machines and stores  ‘for a siege, and to increase his army.   “When Alfonso heard what had been done with the Jew, he swore by his God  “that he would march upon Seville, and besiege Al-mu’tamed in his palace. To  “ that end he collected two armies ; giving the command of one to a Christian dog,  ‘‘ who was one of his most enterprising generals, with instructions to march to  “the province of Beja, in the western part of Andalus, and, after laying waste its  ‘lands and districts, to proceed by the road of Liblah (Niebla) to Seville, where he  “ promised to meet him on a certain day in sight of the suburb called Tarydnah  “ (Triana). Accordingly, Alfonso put himself at the head of numberless troops,  “and, following a different road from that taken by his general [in command of    ",310,book_7,
"    cHapP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 273    ‘“‘the other army], arrived, according to his promise, in sight of Seville, after  “laying waste and destroying every thing on his way to that city. His general  “‘ did the same, and both armies encamped on the bank of the Guadalquivir,  “* opposite to the palace of Ibnu ’Abb4d. One day, during his stay there, Alfonso atfonso  “* wrote an abusive letter to Al-mu’tamed, in which he said to him, ‘My stay at Benito  « this place has already been too long. ‘The heat is great and the flies intolerable ;*?*""8*""""  “‘ make me a present of thy palace, that I may solace myself in its shadowy gardens  ‘‘ and keep away the flies from my face.’ On the receipt of this letter Al-mu’tamed  ‘* wrote on the back of it—‘ We have perused thy letter, and understood its arrogant  “and taunting contents; we intend to procure thee shortly such a shadowy spot,  “* made of the hide of the Jamt (hippopotamus), as thou wilt comfortably lie under,  “* if God be pleased’ [meaning the shields of the Almoravides].   “When Al-mu’tamed’s letter was brought to Alfonso, and he had its contents pened  “‘ read over to him, he understood the meaning [of those expressions], and became aaa  ‘suddenly thoughtful and silent, as a man who is taken by surprise. Being,  “ however, a very shrewd and treacherous man, he began to circulate through  “* Andalus the rumour of Al-mu’tamed’s intentions, and how he was planning  “to call to his help Yusuf Ibn T4shefin, the Almoravide, and give him the  “entrance into Andalus. The generality of the Moslems were delighted at this  “news, as it opened to them the gates of hope. Not so the petty kings of  ** Andalus, who had no sooner ascertained Al-mu’tamed’s real designs, and the  “step he had taken without consulting them, than they began seriously to occupy  “themselves in that business. Some wrote to him; others had interviews with  “chim; all warned him against the determination he had taken, and made him fear  “* its consequences, saying to him—*‘ A kingdom without heirs and one long sword  “‘ do not find room in the same scabbard.’'* To this Al-mu’tamed replied with that  ‘saying which became afterwards a proverb [among the people of Andalus],  “«* Better be a camel driver than a driver of pigs,’ meaning that he would rather  “be Yusuf’s prisoner, and guard his camels in the Desert, than become the captive  “ of Alfonso, and keep his swine in Castile. He then said to those who upbraided  “him for his resolution—‘ My present position is of two sorts, one of doubt,.and  “* one of certainty, and I must needs choose between the two. As to the one of  “‘ doubt, it is whether I am to apply to Yusuf Ibn Téshefin or to Alfonso, since  ‘it is equally possible that either of the two with whom I treat may either keep  “his promise faithfully or not keep it at all. This is the position of doubt;  ‘“as to that of certainty, it is, that if I lean for support on Yusuf Ibn Tashefin,  “I do an act agreeable to God; whereas if, on the contrary, I lean on Al-  “‘fonso, Iam certain of incurring the wrath of God; and, therefore, the position   VOL.

"    Sends him an  embassy.    274 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vil.    “ of doubt being in the present instance clear and evident, why should I leave  “* what is agreeable to God to take that which is offensive to him?’ These reasons  ‘‘allayed in some measure the fears of the petty kings of Andalus, and they  “ desisted from their reproaches.   “« Al-mu’tamed having made up his mind [to implore the assistance of Yusuf],  “* wrote to Al-mutawakkel ""Omar Ibn Mohammed [Ibn Al-afttas], King of Badajoz,  “and to ’Abdullah Ibn Habis As-senhdji, King of Granada, commanding” them  “to send their chief K4dis [to Seville], which they did. He himself summoned  “to his presence the Kédi-l-jam’ah (supreme judge) of Cordova, whose name  ‘“was Abi Bekr ’Obeydullah Ibn Ad’ham, and who was one of the wisest men  “of his time. When the three Kddis had been assembled in Seville, Al-mu’tamed  “added to them his own Wizir, Abi Bekr Ibn Zeydiin, and having signified to  “them his intention to send them all four to Africa, as ambassadors to Yusuf  “ Tbn Tashefin, he gave them the necessary instructions, and provided them with  “the means to cross over to Africa, leaving entirely to their discretion the com-  ** position of the address to be made to that sovereign, and recommending par-  “ ticularly to his own Wizir, Ibn Zeydtin, to uphold his master’s royal dignity.”   The historian Ibnu-l-athir, after relating what Al-mu’tamed did with the am-  bassadors [of Alfonso], and his putting them to death, and the fears of the kings  of Andalus when they heard of his rash act, says, “ That a number of chiefs  ‘collected together [in Cordova], and went to the dwelling of the Kadi Abi  “?Abdillah Ibn Mohammed, whom they addressed in the following words: ‘ Dost  “thou not perceive the humble and abject condition to which the Moslems [of  “this country] have been reduced, paying tribute [to the infidels], after being  “so long in the habit of receiving it [from them]. The Franks have subdued  “the greater part of Andalus, a small portion of which only remains in the  “hands of the Moslems. If the present state of things continue for any length  “ of time, we may be sure that the Christians will soon regain in this country  “ the position they held [before the conquest]. We have thought of an expedient  ““to save ourselves from the impending ruin.’—‘ And what is that?’ said Abi  ‘“* Mohammed to them. ‘To write to the Arabs of Africa [to come to us], and  “to lavish upon them on their arrival half our riches. We will then go out  “with them to fight for the cause of God.’ To this Abi ’Abdillah replied —  “*T only fear that if they once come among us they will not leave this country,    .‘ and will settle in it, as they have done in Eastern Africa; they will leave the    “ Franks alone, and they will set about [destroying] us; and yet, with all that,  ‘the Almoravides are better [than the Christians], and more closely connected  “with us [by religion].’ The assembly then requested Abi ’Abdillah to write",312,book_7,
"    cHapP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 275    “to the commander of the Moslems [Yusuf Ibn T4shefin], asking him to cross over  “to Andalus, or to send an army to their assistance. While they were occupied  ‘in these transactions, Al-mu’tamed Ibn ’Abbdd went to Cordova. Immediately  “upon his arrival, the Kadi Ibn Ad’ham went up to him and informed him of  “‘ what had been determined upon in the assembly. That monarch approved of  “ the plan, and told Ibn Ad’ham that he should be his ambassador to the African  ‘king ; but Ibn Ad’ham refused to accept the charge offered to him, as he wished  “to keep clear of all the consequences. Al-mu’tamed, however, insisted, and  “he went.”   The reader must have observed some slight discrepancy between the account  of Ibn ’Abdi-l-mu’anem (Abi ’Abdillah Ibn ’Abdillah), and that of Ibnu-l-athir ;  but as both authors are well known to have borrowed their information from  the most authentic sources, we have preferred, in pursuance of the plan which  we traced out to ourselves in the composition of the present work, to afford our  readers several versions, however contradictory and opposite, of the same event,  rather than deprive them of the least particle of useful information.   ‘* During the course of these events Yisuf Ibn Tashefin Al-lamtini was estab- Account of  “lishing his power in Africa, and extending the sway of the Almoravides. When Tashefin.  ‘* he had conquered the whole of Western Africa, and founded the cities of Morocco  “and Telemsan, the new ;'* when all the Berber tribes, dreading his vengeance, had  ‘* submitted to his rule and obeyed his commands ; when, in short, he had reduced  “ large districts and extensive provinces under his sway, he conceived the design of  “crossing over to the island of Andalus, and, after turning it over in his own  “‘ mind, began to prepare the ships and other things necessary for the undertaking.   “When the petty kings of Andalus were informed of Ytsuf’s project, they  ‘“‘ disapproved of his intended passage to their island, and made every warlike  ‘‘ preparation to resist it. Yet they were all unwilling to incur his enmity, as  “by doing so they would have been placed between two enemies, the Franks  “on the north, and the Moslems on the south. At that time the Franks were  ‘“‘ more successful than ever they had been against the Moslems; and they plun-  ‘* dered and laid waste every thing before them. Now and then only a peace would  ‘* be concluded between the contending parties, in consideration of a certain tribute  ‘* which the Moslems agreed to pay annually to their enemies. Yet with all this  “the Franks were in no less awe of Yusuf Ibn Tashefin, the ruler of the West,  ‘* whose fame and military exploits had already reached their ears. They knew of the  ‘* reach of his authority, the extent of his empire, and the rapidity of his conquests ;  “* they were well aware of the intrepidity of his followers, the wearers of the veil,  “and of the Sheikhs of the tribes of Senhdjah ; and they dreaded their dexterity in",313,book_7,

No sooner, therefore, were the rulers of Andalus apprised of  ‘* Yisuf’s determination to cross the Straits, than they sent to acquaint one  “another of that circumstance, and to ask each other’s advice as to how they  ‘‘ should act in the emergency. Al-mu’tamed Ibn ’Abbad, King of Seville, being  ‘‘ the most powerful among them, as well as the one who enjoyed the greatest reputa-  “ tion for his courage and his abilities, the rulers of Andalus naturally clung to him  ‘‘ for advice. After much deliberation it was unanimously agreed among them,  “* to ascertain whether Ytsuf really intended to cross over to Andalus, and if so, to  “‘ write to him, asking him to desist from his undertaking, and to say that they  “* were under his obedience. The letter, which was written in the name of all by a  “ Katib of Andalus, ran thus:—‘ If thou desist from thy undertaking, and do  “not attack us, thou wilt act generously, and thy name will not be coupled  ‘‘ with an unjust or dishonourable deed. On the other hand, if we answer thy call  *‘ and acknowledge thee for our master, we shall do that which is wise and prudent,  ‘“and our names will not be coupled with a foolish and inconsiderate act ; we have  “ therefore chosen for thee and for ourselves that which is generous and wise ;  ‘© we will acknowledge thee as our lord and sovereign, and thou wilt remain where  “thou now art, and allow these poor dwellers in tents to continue as they  “ are; for upon their preservation depends, in a certain measure, the duration and  “ strength of thy empire.’  Mis nego. “‘ Ydsuf Ibn Tashefin, although endowed with a clear understanding and much  Pa) wit, did not understand the Arabic language ; so when he received the above  “letter with the presents from the kings of Andalus, he handed it over to his  secretary, who was equally well versed in the language of the Arabs as in that of  “ the Almoravides, and asked him what it meant. ‘O King!’ said the secretary to  “ Yusuf, ‘ this letter is from the kings of Andalus, who exalt and honour thee, and  ‘acknowledge thee as their master, and place themselves under thy .obedience ;  ‘they beseech thee not to treat them as enemies, since they are also Moslems  “and dwellers in tents, and not to attack them, since they have already enough  “to do to fight the infidels beyond their settlements. They tell thee that their  “territories are narrow and exhausted, and will not bear armies [like thine].",314,book_7,

Know that one of the great kings of  ‘yore, well versed in the means [to be employed] to arrive at empire, said,  ‘‘ —The generous man becomes a lord [among his own people]; the lord rises to be  “a chief; the chief is the ruler of the country.’   “When Yiisuf heard his secretary utter the above sentiments, he was at once  “* convinced of the soundness of the advice and the truth of his words, and he  ‘* accordingly directed him to write an answer to that effect in his name, and read it  ‘“over to him before he sent it to Andalus. The secretary then wrote as follows :  «Tn the name of God the merciful! the compassionate! [This letter is] from  “« Yusuf Ibn Tashefin, who salutes you all, and invokes upon you the mercy and  “« the blessings of God. (May they descend at once on the saluter and the saluted !)  “« Know ye that whatever you possess of empire, in the broadest acceptation [of  “‘ this word], is perfectly secure in your hands, and that you are welcome to its  “* possession ; that we entertain for you all the greatest regard and esteem, and that  “‘ therefore we are anxious to see good faith and amity exist between us, and hope  “that you will treat us as brothers. God is the imparter of help both to you  and to me.’  “ The letter being written, the secretary read it in his native tongue to Yusuf,  ‘‘who approved of its contents. Having then prepared some suitable presents  “* for the Andalusian rulers, among which were many valuable shields covered with  “‘ the skins of the Jamt, and which could not be procured elsewhere than in his own  “‘ dominions, Yusuf gave his reply to the messenger and dismissed him.  “When the kings of Andalus received Ytisuf’s letter, and had perused it, they  were extremely satisfied, and they praised and extolled above all things the  modesty and moderation of that Sultan.

Ytisuf Ibn Téshefin had [for some time past] seen at the capital of  “his dominions numbers of men from the frontier towns [reduced by Alfonso],  ‘* who came with tears in their eyes and sorrow in their hearts, calling to God  “and their brothers in Islam [for protection], and imploring the Kadis and  “ theologians of his court and the Wizirs of his government to intercede for them.  “ Yiisuf had listened to their prayers, and sympathised with their sufferings ;  “his heart had melted at the narrative of their misfortunes. Just as the ambas-  “ sadors of Al-mu’tamed were crossing the Straits, Ytisuf was sending emissaries  “ over to Andalus [to ascertain the real state of the country]. The ambassadors  “arrived [at Morocco], and Yusuf received them with every show of attention and  “honour, and promised to give the help required, which being reported to Al-  “‘ mu’tamed, he fitted out a fleet at Seville to communicate with the governor  “ of Ceuta, and to keep him well informed of the movements of Yusuf. After  “ various negotiations between the ambassadors of Al-mu’tamed and Yusuf, the  * Kadis returned to Seville, and the Almoravide Sultdn crossed the Strait, and  “Janded without the least difficulty at Al-jeziratu-l-khadhra (Algesiras), the  “ inhabitants of which opened their gates, and went out to him with all sorts  “ of provisions, and erected a market-place, to which abundance of provisions was  ‘ taken [from the neighbouring districts]. It having been announced by the public  ‘‘crier that Yusuf had arrived in the country [for the purpose of waging war  ‘“‘ against Alfonso], numbers of volunteers flocked from all parts to his banner,  “until the public squares and the mosques [of the place] would no longer hold  “them.” So far the author of the Raudhu-l-mwattar.   Tbn Ad’ham and the rest of the ambassadors found Yusuf Ibn Tashefin at  Ceuta, and, having delivered to him the credentials [of Al-mu’tamed], proceeded  to describe to him the state of Andalus, and the constant fear in which the Moslems  were of Alfonso’s power.",316,book_7,

Yusur Ibn Téshefin had no sooner heard the report of the ambassadors [of Al- Yisuf crosses  mu’tamed], than he gave immediate orders for the crossing of his army, which  came [to Ceuta] one division after the other. When all had arrived, Yusuf crossed  the Strait and joined Al-mu’tamed in Seville. This monarch had also made  immense preparations, since, besides the troops of Seville and a considerable force  sent him by the people of Cordova, he was joined by numbers of volunteers from  the different provinces of Andalus. Ibn Khallekan says, that Yusuf Ibn Tashefin  had camels transported to Andalus in such numbers that the country was actually  filled with them, and that their cries reached the sky. The people of Andalus had  never seen camels, and their horses were greatly frightened at them. The sight of  one of those animals, or his cry, was enough to make a horse rear and throw  his rider. It was a good idea of Yiisuf’s to take camels to Andalus, and to train  them to war, and surround his camp with them, for they were afterwards of great  assistance to him by throwing into disorder the Christian cavalry.   But let us again see what the author of the Raudhu-l-mu’attar says on this Marches to  topic, who not only has dwelt at full length on the history of Andalus, but was  a native of that country, although I am unable to say to what tribe he belonged,  or in what city he had his dwelling. ‘‘ When Yisuf, with all his army, had  “crossed [the Strait] and landed at Jeziratu-l-khadhra [Algesiras], he marched  ‘to Seville in the finest order, army after army, general after general, and tribe  ‘after tribe. Al-mu’tamed sent his own son to meet him, and issued orders  “to the governors of the districts [through which Yusuf had to pass] to furnish",317,book_7,

Every  ‘“‘ where Yusuf met with a reception that pleased him exceedingly, and he was  “ highly rejoiced. In this manner the several divisions of his army marched under  “their respective commanders until they arrived in sight of Seville. At the  “ approach of Yusuf, Al-mu’tamed went out to receive him, escorted by one  ‘“‘ hundred cavaliers and the principal officers [of his court]. At a short distance  “from the spot where Ytisuf had encamped, Al-mu’tamed put his horse to a’  ‘« gallop, which being perceived by the people of the camp, they also went out  “towards him. Yusuf then left his tent and met Al-mu’tamed alone, when both  ‘* princes shook hands and embraced each other, and showed friendship and sin-  “* cerity, thanking God for his favours, and recommending to each other courage  ‘* [in the field] and compassion [towards the Moslems]. They congratulated each  “ other upon their determination to wage war against the infidel, and prayed to  “God Almighty that he would render their act pure and acceptable to him.  ‘They then separated; Yusuf returned to his camp, Al-mu’tamed to his own  ‘* quarters, where, having collected together the presents, gifts, and provisions  ‘“‘ which he had brought for Yusuf, he sent them to the tent [of that monarch].  ‘* Al-mu’tamed and Yusuf passed that night under their tents; but on the ensuing  ‘* morning, after the prayer of sunrise, all mounted on horseback, and the former  “having proposed to ride on to Seville, Ytsuf accepted the proposition, and  ‘* gave orders to that effect. Once in the capital of Al-mu’tamed, the Africans  ‘* witnessed enough of the splendour of royalty to make them glad. There was  “no king of Andalus but who either hastened to Seville in person, or sent some  “one to represent him, appearing there at the head of his own army, or sending  ‘it under the command of an experienced general. [It is true] the people of  “the Desert had done the same with respect to Yusuf, every one of the tribes  “ or districts [of Western Africa] sending down their contingent of men to assist  “ in the undertaking.   Preparations“ Qn the other hand, when Alfonso had ascertained that Yusuf was marching  ‘in hostile array against him, he summoned to arms all the men of his own and  “the neighbouring kingdom, as well as those of the countries beyond them;  ‘his priests, bishops, and monks raising every where their crosses and displaying  “their gospels [in order to engage the people in the contest]. By these means  ‘he collected round him an innumerable host of Franks and Galicians, and  “« established couriers to inform him of the movements of each army.   ‘These preparations being complete, Alfonso wrote a letter to Al-mu’tamed,  ‘in which he said to him,—‘ Your friend Yusuf is no doubt tired of his native  “* country, and has crossed the seas [in order to fix himself here]; but I am likely",318,book_7,
"    CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 281    “to give him occupation for the rest [of his days]. He was evidently so much  *‘ taken with you, and wished so much to see you, that he spared you the trouble  “« fof going over to him], and he came here to meet you in your country, and to  ‘‘show you all the friendship and regard which he has for you.’ Having then  ‘© assembled his favourites and the members of his council, he addressed them  “in the following words: ‘Methinks that were I to allow the enemy to cross  ‘the passes [leading] to this my kingdom, and to engage my army on this side  “‘ of the mountain barriers [which encompass this country], if the fortune of war  ‘* decides against me, the Africans will doubtless take possession of this country,  “and mow down its inhabitants at one stroke; whereas if, on the contrary, I  ‘try my forces with theirs on the skirts of their country, and the fortune of  “the day were to turn against us, they will be satisfied with the advantages  “« [gained] and will not follow us beyond the mountains, for fear of leaving the  ‘* passes at their back; or if they do follow us, it will not be before they have  ‘“‘ made fresh preparations, and some time has been spent (in them]. This plan,  ‘“T imagine, will prove a preservative to our country, and a sort of palliative to our  “ defeat. If, on the contrary, the enemy should be beaten and we prove victorious,  ‘JT shall have over them, and in their country, that very advantage which I  “‘ fear they may reap in ours. I am, therefore, determined to fight them in the  “ very heart of their country.’ In conformity with this resolution, Alfonso, having  ‘taken with him the élite of his army and his choicest troops, advanced towards  “the passes which lead into the Moslem territory, leaving the rest of his forces  ‘‘ behind. It is related that when Alfonso saw the flower of his troops formed  “in line of battle, he could not help exclaiming in raptures, ‘ With such men  “ag these I engage to fight the genii, the demons, and the angels of heaven.’  ** According to the lowest computation the army which Alfonso chose to accompany  ‘him on that expedition consisted of forty thousand men, clad in coats of bright  “mail, without counting their [mounted] followers; but the Christians stared  “with amazement at those who made such low reckoning, and declared that  “their numbers were still greater. All agree, however, that the Moslems were  “ on this occasion less numerous than the unbelievers.   ‘“* Whilst these events were passing, Alfonso dreamt one night that he was His dream.  “riding on a huge elephant, which was all the time beating a drum with his  “trunk. Being greatly terrified by this vision, he consulted his priests and  “‘monks about it, but he found no one who could explain its meaning to him.  “ At last he bribed a Jew to go over to the Moslem territory, and try to ascertain  “its meaning from some learned man well versed in the interpretation of dreams.  “‘ Having found a Moslem who professed to explain dreams, the Jew related to   VOL. 11. 20",319,book_7,

The dream may be explained in those words of the  “* Korén,—‘ Seest thou not how thy Lord has dealt with the people of the elephant ?’  “* As to the elephant beating [the drum] with his trunk, the meaning of it is that  “ Alfonso will receive a wound in his face, which will also happen on the same  ‘‘ ominous day.’ The Jew returned to Alfonso, to whom he related the interview  ‘he had held with the interpreter ; but, instead of imparting to him the explanation  ‘“‘ which the astrologer had given him, he offered him a satisfactory one, more  “ suitable to his position and views.   “They relate that Alfonso wrote a letter to Yusuf, which a traitor Moslem  “composed for him, wherein he used very abusive language, and endeavoured to  ‘intimidate that Sultan, by greatly exaggerating the forces, military stores, and  ‘‘ provisions which he had at his disposal. When the letter arrived and was  “read to Yusuf, he ordered his secretary Abi Bekr Ibnu-l-kossayrah ' to answer it.  “ Abi Bekr, who was a learned and elegant writer, retired and soon returned  ‘‘ with a long epistle full of rhetorical beauties, which being read to Ydsuf, he  “said to him, ‘That answer is too long; bring me Alfonso’s letter.’ Abi Bekr  ‘“‘ did as he was commanded, and Yusuf wrote these words upon the back of it,—  ‘“«He who shall live will see.”* When Alfonso read these words he trembled  “with fear, and soon became convinced that he had to deal with a man against  ‘* whom all his power would be useless.   ‘* However, after spending some time on the passes, Alfonso marched with his  “army towards the western provinces of Andalus. He was there met by the  “ Sultan Ytsuf, who advanced against him. Al-mu’tamed had remained behind,  “‘ occupied in some pressing business ; but when he had dispatched it, he followed  “his track with an army composed of warriors trained to border warfare, and  “ the chiefs of Andalus. His son ’Abdullah led the van, and as he was marching  “he recited extempore the following verses, which have since become cele-  “ brated :   ‘ Joy is near at hand; it shall come to thee [coupled] with wonderful  ‘ events.  ‘ From this blessed expedition thou canst not fail shortly to return victorious :",320,book_7,

VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 283    ‘ For God grants thee his help, whilst he sends down destruction upon the  ‘ worshipper of the crucified.  ‘ We may, indeed, expect a day as glorious as that of Koleyb.’*   “ The [allied] armies arrived at Badhalios (Badajoz), and encamped outside the Arrival at  ‘walls. The king of that city, Al-mutawakkel ""Omar Ibn Mohammed Ibn Al- mn  ‘ afttas, went out to meet the Moslems some distance from this capital with  “‘ refreshments and provisions, and showed them every possible attention and  “respect. He brought them news of the movements of Alfonso,‘ and told them  “ that he was already in the neighbourhood with all his forces. Upon the receipt  “ of this intelligence, Yiisuf advanced against the enemy, and the two hosts were  ‘* goon in sight of each other. Fearing some stratagem of the enemy, Al-mu’tamed  “gent out experienced people to examine and reconnoitre the camp of the Al-  ‘* moravides ;° he himself, after seeing the sentries placed at the gates [of the  “ camp], as well as detachments of cavalry and infantry [to guard against a  “‘ surprise], would go out every night and ride outside the camp, so that if a  “« soldier left his tent he was sure to find Al-mu’tamed going his rounds.   ‘* When the two armies were in presence of each other, Ytisuf wrote to Alfonso, holed  ‘* offering him one of the three [conditions] prescribed by the law; namely, Isl4m,  “tribute, or death. The letter was a long one, and elegantly written. Among  “ other things which it contained was the following: ‘ We understand, O Alfonso!  ‘that thou didst once express the wish of coming over to us [in Africa], and  “ didst regret thou hadst no vessels to allow thee to do so.” Thy wishes are now  “accomplished. Here we are, ready to meet thee wherever thou pleasest, and  ‘* we shall see how thy prayers have been attended to. It is a thing well known,  “« that infidels never pray except in the path of error.’   “ At the receipt of this letter the unbeliever was highly indignant; he flew  ‘into a most violent passion, and returned an answer indicative of the miserable  ‘state (of his mind]. His bishops and monks then raised their crosses in the  “air, and displayed their gospels, pledging themselves to die [for their religion].  “On the other hand, both Ytisuf and Al-mu’tamed addressed their respective  “ followers ; after which, theologians, and other men distinguished by the sanctity  “ of their lives, assuming the functions of Khattibs or preachers, erected temporary  “ pulpits from which they preached to the soldiers, stimulating them to show  “ courage and resolution in the approaching contest, and warning them against  “ cowardice or flight.   “« On Wednesday morning, at break of day, the scouts came to the camp of Yisuf  ‘and informed him that Alfonso had struck his tents and was close at hand.  ‘* On the receipt of this intelligence, the Moslems fell into their ranks and prepared",321,book_7,

On the following morning, which was Thursday, Alfonso  “sent a message to Al-mu’tamed, thus conceived: ‘To-morrow is Friday, and  “‘a holiday for the people of thy creed; so is Sunday for those of ours; let the  “ battle, then, take place on the intermediate day, which is Saturday.’ Al-  ‘“mu’tamed hastened to communicate to Ytsuf the message he had received ;  “at the same time intimating to him his conviction that it was merely intended  “to deceive, and that Alfonso really meant to attack them on Friday. He there-  “fore advised that Sult4n to keep his men in readiness the whole of Friday.  “This was done as he proposed; the men received orders to be prepared for  “ battle, and the sentries to be on the alert.   “In the middle of the night of Thursday, a devout and holy Faquih, named  ‘* Abi-l-’abbds Ahmed Ibn Romeylah Al-kortobi, who followed the camp of Al-  “ mu’tamed, awoke in great exultation and delight, saying to all those whom  ‘he happened to meet, how he had that very night seen in a dream the messenger  “‘of God [Mohammed], who had assured him of the victory, and told him that  “he himself would fall a martyr for the faith at sunrise of the ensuing day.  “ Accordingly, Abi-l-’abbds prepared himself; he passed a part of the night in  ‘‘ prayer, and anointed and perfumed his head. This circumstance having been  “ reported to Al-mu’tamed, he hastened to communicate it to Yusuf, as one proof  “ more of the treason which the infidel king was meditating.   “The same night [of Thursday], two horsemen, belonging to the army of  “‘ Al-mu’tamed, came and informed that prince, that having, according to his  “instructions, spied Alfonso’s camp, they had heard a confused noise as of  “‘ troops marching to and fro, and soldiers getting their weapons ready. Shortly  ‘‘ after other horsemen arrived at full gallop into the camp, bringing positive  ‘information of Alfonso’s movements. These were quickly followed by some  “scouts whom Al-mu’tamed had sent into the Christian camp to ascertain, if  ‘* possible, what were the intentions of the enemy. They returned, saying, ‘We  ‘“‘ sharpened our ears and listened; and heard Alfonso say to his people,—Al-  “* mu’tamed is well practised in Andalusian warfare; the Africans are not; for,  “‘ however intelligent and experienced in military affairs the latter may be, they  “are totally unacquainted with this country and its different modes of warfare.  “Tt is clear, therefore, that on the present occasion they are entirely guided by  “the advice of Al-mu’tamed: against him, then, must your attacks be first  ** directed, and your utmost courage and perseverance be displayed ; for, if once",322,book_7,
"    CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 285    “* you defeat him, the victory over the Africans will be easily gained. For my  ‘ part, I do not think that Al-mu’tamed can resist you long, if you attack him with  “vigour and determination.’ :   ‘‘ Upon the receipt of this information, Al-mu’tamed dispatched his Katib, Abii His plans |   “ Bekr Ibnu-l-kossayrah, to inform the Sult4n Yusuf of the approach of Alfonso, disconcerted.  “ and of his plan of attack, and to ask him at the same time to re-inforce his army  ‘‘ with some troops. Ibnu-l-kossayrah galloped through the camp, until he reached  ‘the tent of Yusuf Ibn Tdshefin, to whom he delivered his master’s message.  “‘ Yusuf answered, ‘Go and tell Al-mu’tamed that I will shortly hasten to his  “* assistance ;” saying which, he directed one of his generals to take a body of  “ troops, which he named, and to attack and fire Alfonso’s camp as soon as he  “saw him engaged with Al-mu’tamed. Ibnu-l-kossayrah then returned to his  ‘master ; but scarcely had he had time to communicate the answer of which he  ‘* was the bearer, when the troops of the infidel king made their appearance.   “* Al-mu’tamed [and his men] fought with the courage of despair, but the troops larrigs  ‘of Alfonso being greatly superior in numbers, the Moslems were surrounded mu'tamed’s  “and hemmed in on all sides. The struggle now became fiercer than ever, and the""?   ‘* furnaces of war burned with additional violence ; death exercised its fury among  “ the followers of Al-mu’tamed, who himself performed on that day such feats of  ‘* arms as no warrior in his army could equal. Meanwhile the King of Seville was  ‘ anxiously expecting the re-inforcements which Yusuf had promised to him. He Realous ees  “kept looking in the direction of the African camp, but no troops came; the monarch.  “‘ Christians, on the other hand, repeated their attacks with increasing fury, until, at  ‘* last, the Andalusians, disheartened by their own loss, and not seeing the Africans  “‘ come to their assistance, began to lose courage. Some of them even gave way,  “< and in their number Al-mu’tamed’s own son, ’Abdullah. However, that monarch  “ continued fighting until he was thrice wounded ; he received a sabre cut on the  “head, which went through his helmet and lodged in his head, as far as the  ‘temples ; he received another sabre cut in the right hand, and a thrust of a spear  ‘in his thigh; he had three chargers killed under him, and whenever he was  “‘ dismounted he was immediately supplied with another steed. Often did he seek  “« death in the ranks of the enemy by rushing into the middle of them and dealing  “‘ blows right and left. In that situation, and whilst the blood was dripping from  “his wounds, Al-mu’tamed happened to think of a pet child of his, surnamed  “ Abi Hashim, whom he had left behind [in Seville] owing to a slight indis-  ‘ position, and he exclaimed—  ‘O Abd Hashim! the sword [of the enemy] has fractured my bones ;  ‘but God gave me courage and endurance throughout the bloody conflict.",323,book_7,

The first among the generals of Yiisuf who came to  “ the assistance [of the Andalusians] was Déwid Ibn ’A’yeshah, an experienced  “ and brave officer. Next came Yusuf himself with banners displayed and drums  “* beating, the sounds of which resounded loudly through the air. This being  “ perceived by Alfonso, he sent against the Africans a body of his best troops ;  “he in person followed them with the greater part of his army. Yusuf then  “hastened towards them, and having charged the enemy at the head of all his  “* forces, made them fall back upon their cantonments. The relics of Al-mu’tamed’s  “ division gathered round Yiisuf’s host ; the men began to sniff up the odoriferous  ‘* gales of victory, and congratulate each other upon their forthcoming success.  “* This done, the Moslems again charged the enemy together and at once; the  “* earth quaked under the hoofs of their horses ; the sun was obscured by the clouds  “* of dust rising under the feet of the warriors ; the steeds swam through torrents of  Extrleates him.

Alfonso then fled the  “ field of battle, not without having received a wound in one of his knees, which  “made him lame for the rest of his life.”  Takes and According to Ibn. Khallekén (in the life of Yusuf Ibn Téshefin), when, as above  serene - related, Alfonso had nearly destroyed Al-mu’tamed’s division, Yusuf summoned  camp round him his best infantry, and the cavalry of Senhéjah and the chiefs of the  principal [Berber] tribes, and, putting himself at their head, led the attack against  the camp of Alfonso, which he surprised and entered, putting to the sword all  the troops left for its defence. The stormy din of drums, the clash of clarion  and trumpet, filled the air; the earth quaked [under the weight of the warriors],  and the neighbouring mountains echoed the thousand discordant sounds. The  Christians [who were closely engaged with Al-mu’tamed] seeing the Moslems in  possession of their camp, returned to expel them therefrom ; upon which, the Amir,  Yusuf, went out [to assist them, and having repulsed the assailants,] returned to  the camp, and expelled the Christians from it.’ Again the enemy returned to the  attack, but they were a second time repulsed, and the camp remained in the posses-  sion of the Moslems. In this manner the attacks succeeded each other, until the",324,book_7,

In the middle of the conflict Alfonso attacked, sword in hand, eee  a black slave who had spent all his javelins, and aimed at his head; but the black the thigh.  avoided the blow, and, creeping under Alfonso’s horse, seized the animal by the  bridle; then taking out a khanjar,° which he wore at his girdle, he wounded the  Christian king in the thigh, the instrument piercing both armour and flesh, and  pinning Alfonso to his horse’s saddle. The rout then became general, the gales of  victory blew, and God sent down his spirit to the Moslems, rendering the true  religion triumphant. A charge more desperate than the others at last expelled  the Christians from their camp, and completed their discomfiture. Every where the  infidels turned their backs before the Moslems, quietly giving up their throats to  the caresses of the swords, and their bodies to the thrusting of the spears. Those  who escaped fled to a small eminence in the vicinity of the camp, where they tried  to make a stand. They were immediately surrounded by the cavalry of the Mos-  lems, and would inevitably have been taken had not night come on, under cover of  which Alfonso and his followers were enabled to come down and escape destruction,  when they must already have felt the fangs of death upon their throats. The  Moslems, however, took possession of every thing they found in the Christian  camp,—stores, weapons, provisions, tents,!° vases, and so forth.   But let us hear what the author of the Raudhu-l-mu’attar says on the subject. Fees the field  “ After the defeat of his army, Alfonso ascended a small eminence close to his of bate  “‘ camp, with five hundred of his knights, every one of whom had been more or less  ‘“‘ wounded in the conflict: from thence they all disappeared in the course of the  “night. All those who did not follow the example of their king were either  ‘« killed or taken prisoners ; the number of those who died in the battle or after it  “being so great that the plain was actually covered with their bodies, and that  ‘‘ the heads of the slain, piled up in various places, formed several pulpits from  “which the muezzins called the faithful to prayer: indeed, had Alfonso stayed  ‘to contemplate the field of battle, he would have found it a terrible lesson to  “him and to his followers.   ‘© As it was, when he arrived at his city [Toledo], and began to inquire about Diese sora  “his friends and courtiers and the brave warriors of his army, and was told that ment.  “‘ every one of them was either slain or a captive in the hands of the Moslems,  «* —-when he perceived that wherever he went there was nothing but wailings and",325,book_7,
"    288 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK VII.    “* Jamentations,—he fell suddenly into a dejected state of mind, and neither ate nor  “drank, until he actually died of sorrow and disappointment. He left no male  “« children, and was succeeded by a daughter, who shut herself up in Toledo.""   ‘« Immediately after the battle, Al-mu’tamed went to see Yusuf, shook hands with  “‘ him, congratulated him upon the victory he had gained, and thanked and praised  “him [for the assistance he had lent to the common cause]. Ytisuf, on the other  ‘hand, thanked Al-mu’tamed for his exertions, and the courage which he had  “‘ displayed in the contest. Yvtisuf having, in the course of conversation, asked  “ Al-mu’tamed how he was when his timely aid came to extricate him from his  “« dangerous position, that monarch answered him, ‘Thou hadst better ask [the  “ fugitives]; there they are before thee.’   ‘* Al-mu’tamed wrote from the field of battle, announcing to his son in Seville  “the victory which the Moslems had gained. The letter was thus conceived:  “« From the camp of victory, this Friday, the 20th of Rejeb, [a.u. 479]. God  “has exalted the faith, and rendered the Moslems victorious, granting them a  ‘manifest victory, routing and putting to flight the idolaters and unbelievers. He  ‘“‘ has made the latter taste the awful punishments and excruciating tortures which  ‘‘ await them [in hell]. Praise [be given] to God for the signal favours he has  “« just granted to us, and the contentment and joy he has this day sent down unto  “us by breaking down the power and scattering the forces of Alfonso, annihilating  ‘the whole of his army, and committing so many of his followers to the raging  ‘* fires of hell, where they will not fail to be subjected to those everlasting torments  “which are reserved for the infidels. Our victory was complete: we took and  “‘ plundered his camp, and put to the sword the whole of his men, his most  “‘ renowned warriors and stoutest champions; the slaughter being so great that  ‘* the Moslems are now piling up the heads of the slain, and raising towers from  ‘* which to proclaim the hours of public prayer. Praise [be given] to God for all his  “‘ favours. As to me, I received a few slight wounds, which at first were painful  ‘“* enough, but are now closed. Praise be given to God. Fare thee well.’” -   In this battle numbers of Moslems won the crown of martyrdom, among whom  were several chiefs and doctors distinguished by their virtues or their talents, such  as Ibn Romeylah, whose dream we have related above, Abii Merwadn ’Abdu-l-malek  Al-masmidi, Kadi of Morocco, and others. (May God Almighty have mercy  on their souls!) Yet the loss of the Moslems was trifling when compared with  that experienced by the Christians. For many years after the field of battle was so  covered with the carcasses of the slain, that it was impossible to walk through it  without treading on the withered bones of some infidel.   The Moslems remained four days encamped on the field of battle, occupied in",326,book_7,

When every thing had been got together,  Yisuf’s pleasure was consulted with regard to the partition; but Yisuf would  not touch any portion of the spoil, and gaye it to the Andalusian chieftains to  be divided among them, saying, ‘‘I came not to this country for the sake of  ‘“‘ plunder; I came for no other purpose than that of waging war against the    6c    “o    infidel, and thereby deserving the rewards promised to those who fight for the  cause of God.” When the Andalusian princes saw Yuisuf’s generous conduct    with regard to the division of the spoil, they praised his liberality, and thanked  him for it.    But to return to the principal subject of our narrative. ‘‘ The battle being over, Yésuf visits  eville,    ‘* Al-mu’tamed invited Yusuf Ibn Tashefin to accompany him to Seville, and the  “latter having accepted the invitation, both princes repaired to that capital, ac-    companied by a numerous and brilliant escort. When Ydsuf Ibn Tdshefin saw  Seville, which, as is well known, is one of the most splendid and magnificent cities  {in the world], he could not remove his eyes from the sight, and his mind was  absorbed in the contemplation of its many beauties. Seville is situated on the  banks of a large river, into which the tide pours the waters of the sea, and  which is navigated by merchant ships trading between Maghreb (Western Africa)  and Andalus. To the west of the city lies a fertile district, twenty parasangs in  length, in which are upwards of one thousand hamlets surrounded by orchards  and gardens, where the vine, the olive, and fig-tree grow in great luxuriance.  The district is called Sharaf (Axarafe), and constitutes one of the greatest  beauties of Seville, there being no other city in the West to be compared to  it on this account. On one side of the city are the palaces of Al-mu’tamed and  of his father, Al-mu’tadhed, both extremely beautiful [in their proportions], and  most splendid in their decorations. In one of these palaces, which was furnished Is magni-    ficently enter-    for the occasion with every requisite article, Yisuf Ibn Tashefin was lodged tained by the  with his suite, Al-mu’tamed taking care that they should be daily provided with Gf °""""""  food, drink, clothes, beds, &c., and appointing persons to see that all the wishes   of his royal guest were fully gratified. Such, indeed, was the attention and  courtesy which Al-mu’tamed displayed on this occasion, that Yusuf could not   forbear showing his gratitude, and thanking him for his hospitality.   “There were in the suite of Ibn Tdshefin [Yvisuf] several courtiers who were The Almora-    dexterously calling the attention of that Sultan to the comforts and luxuries Snpostion to  by which he was surrounded, and to the pleasures and enjoyments which his Kndaius.  host was daily procuring for him, as well as instigating him to adopt a similar    mode of living.

The answer was, that Al-  ‘* mu’tamed always led the same life [of dissipation and pleasure]. ‘And do  ‘* Al-mu’tamed’s friends, do his allies, and the high functionaries of his court,  ‘“‘ approve of his conduct and imitate him ?’—‘ No, they do not.’—‘ Well, then,  ** how are they pleased with him?’—‘ They are not pleased at all,’ was the courtier’s  ‘answer.

I have been  “ thinking of an expedient, which, if thou art inclined to listen to me, I will  ** proceed to state.’—‘ Speak,’ said Al-mu’tamed impatiently. ‘This man,’ con-  ‘tinued the stranger, ‘whom thou hast allowed to pry into thy kingdom, is  ‘‘ well known to have sprung like a lion upon the kings of various countries,  “‘and to have dispossessed them of all their dominions. Witness the Zendtah  “‘ of the opposite coast, whose chiefs he attacked in succession, and deprived of  “all their power, and would mercilessly have destroyed, had not the sight of  “the luxuries and comforts by which thou art surrounded suddenly filled him  “with a desire to seize on thy kingdom; nay, on the whole of this island; for  **T do not imagine that thy colleagues, the rulers of Andalus, will fare better  “than thou.

Whilst he was absorbed in his thoughts, one  “of his courtiers, whom, like many others, Al-mu’tamed was in the habit of  “ admitting to his parties of pleasure, addressed himself to the counsellor, and said :  “ «Tt is not for princes like Al-mu’tamed, who is the pattern of every virtue, to  “commit such a treacherous act as to seize the person of his guest.’-—‘ No  “ matter,’ replied the man, ‘treason always takes the right from the hands of  ‘its possessor, to protect the man who is hard pressed by his enemy.’ '%—  ‘“« Injury with good faith,’ replied the courtier, ‘is preferable to prudence with  ‘injustice.’ The counsellor would go on defending his opinion, but Al-mu’tamed  ‘‘ dismissed him, after thanking him for his good advice, and making him a hand-  ‘© some present.   “ It appears, however, that Yusuf got intelligence of what had passed ; for when,  “on the morning of the ensuing day, Al-mu’tamed came up to him, as usual, with  “costly presents and valuable gifts, he took leave of him and departed on the  “same day. Some historians relate that Yusuf Ibn Tashefin dwelt outside of  “‘ Seville, and that when he had been there three days news came to him from  “‘ Maghreb (Western Africa), which required his: presence in that country; that  ‘* [Al-mu’tamed] Ibn ’Abbéd accompanied him one day and one night, after which  “Yusuf, seeing that his wounds were sore, begged and entreated him to return  “to his capital, which Al-mu’tamed did, not without appointing his own son,  “Abdullah, to accompany his illustrious guest to the sea shore, and to cross  “ over to Africa with him.”   On his return to Seville, Al-mu’tamed sat one day in public, and the people  were admitted to his presence.

Yusur had no sooner left the shores of Andalus than Alfonso began again to plan  the destruction of the Moslems. Having put himself at the head of considerable  forces, he invaded the dominions of ’Abdu-]-’aziz, King of Murcia, and laid siege to  a strong castle, called Aleyt (Aledo), which he attacked so vigorously that he soon  after took it by storm. Leaving a large force for the defence of the place, Alfonso  retired into his own dominions ; but the Christian garrison of Aledo made so many  incursions into the dominions of Al-mu’tamed, that this Sultan was again’ compelled  to cross over to Africa, and implore Yiisuf’s assistance. Accordingly, in the month  of Rabi’-l-aw4l of 481 (May or June, a. p. 1088), the commander of the Moslems  again landed at Algesiras at the head of a considerable army, and, having united  his forces to those of Al-mu’tamed, marched to Aledo, which he besieged. Owing,  however, to some misunderstanding which arose among the Andalusian chieftains,?  Yuisuf was unable to reduce the place, and after some slight incursions made into  the neighbouring districts of the enemy, he crossed over to Africa.   In the year 483 (beginning March 5, a.p. 1090), Yusuf Ibn Téshefin visited  Andalus for the third time, in order to wage war against the infidels. Having  penetrated as far as Toledo, the court and capital of Alfonso, he besieged it ; but,  although he repeatedly attacked the city, laid waste all the country around,",332,book_7,
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 295    and prevented provisions and stores being conveyed to it, he was in the end  compelled to raise the siege and return to his dominions across the sea. They say  that on this occasion not one of the Andalusian chieftains joined the banners of  Yusuf, although they had been particularly requested to do so, which so incensed  that Sultdn, that he decided to chastise them for their negligence, and to deprive  them of their dominions.   Among the Andalusian rulers who would not answer the summons of Yiisuf was Deprives  Abdullah Ibn Balkin, who not only did not join that Sultén with his forces, but Balkin of his  had actually concluded a treaty of alliance with Alfonso. Upon him Yusuf first dominions.  wreaked his vengeance. At his approach, ’Abdullah shut the gates of his city, and  made some show of resistance ; but his mother having advised him to try by his  submission to quiet Yusuf’s anger, he went out to meet him, and gave him the  salém. After this he returned to Granada to prepare for the reception of his  illustrious guest; but Yusuf had no sooner gained admittance into ’Abdullah’s  palace than he seized the person of his host, and sent him in irons to Aghmét,  together with his brother Temim, governor of Malaga, after taking possession of  the immense treasures which that Sultan had amassed during a long and prosperous  reign. This ’Abdullah was the grandson of Baddis, son of Habis, founder of the  dynasty of the Zeyrites of Granada. .   In the month of Ramadhan of the same year (a. Hu. 483), Yusuf Ibn TAshefin His generals  quitted Andalus for Africa, leaving one of his best generals, named Seyr Ibn Abi reat of Ans  Bekr, with a body of troops to prosecute the war against the unbelievers. After“  allowing some days’ rest to his men, Seyr led them against Alfonso, whose king-  dom he invaded, plundering and laying waste the land, slaying and making  captives of the inhabitants, reducing the best fortified towns and the strongest  and most inaccessible fortresses. In this manner he penetrated far into the  Christian territory, collecting rich spoils and immense treasures. Having left  bodies of infantry and cavalry to garrison the places which he had taken from  the enemy, Seyr sent to apprise Ytisuf of his success, and to inform him that  whilst his own troops were performing a service of danger on the frontiers, waging  incessant war against the Christians, and leading at the same time a life of hard-  ship and privation, the kings of Andalus were plunged in pleasure and sloth,  and their subjects were enjoying a happy and easy life. He therefore requested  him to send him his instructions respecting the said kings, and to inform him  how he was to deal with them. Yvtisuf’s answer was thus conceived: ‘ Order  ‘‘them to accompany thee to the enemy’s country; if they obey, well and good ;   “if they refuse, lay siege to their cities, attack them one after the other, and  “‘ destroy them without mercy.

"    Seyr, the Al-  moravide, at-  tacks the King  of Saragossa.    Takes the  castle of Roda.    Dethrones the  Kings of  Murcia and  Almeria.    Puts to death  Thu Al-afttas,  King of  Badajoz.    296 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book VIII.    ‘minions border on the enemy’s frontier, and shalt not attack Al-mu’tamed  ‘until thou hast reduced the rest of Mohammedan Spain.to thy obedience. To  ‘every city or town which may thus fall into thy hands thou shalt appoint a  “ governor from among the officers of thy army.”   Agreeably to his instructions, Seyr first turned his arms against Ibn Hud (King  of Saragossa], who was then [residing] at Rottah (Roda), a strong castle® fortified  with great art and skill, having abundance of fresh water springing up at great  height, and in which there was, moreover, such a quantity of provisions and stores  of all kinds collected by the kings his predecessors, that time only could consume  them. This castle Seyr besieged; but perceiving that he could not reduce it,  owing to its marvellous strength, he had recourse to the following stratagem. One  day he raised the siege, struck his tents, and went away some distance from the  castle: having then selected a division of his army, he dressed them in the Christian  fashion, and directed them to approach the castle, as if they were friends, and came  to sell them provisions; whilst he himself with the remainder of his forces lay  concealed in the neighbourhood. It happened as Seyr had anticipated.- No sooner  had the garrison of Roda perceived the disguised Africans, than, seeing them in  small number, and not suspecting any treason, they came out of the castle, and  the governor among them; upon which, Seyr left his place of concealment, and,  rushing suddenly upon the governor, seized him with his own hand, made him  prisoner, and obliged him to surrender his castle. :   Seyr next attacked the Beni Tahir in the eastern parts of Andalus. Having  advanced upon Murcia, where [’Abdu-r-rahm4n] Ibn Tahir‘ was ruling at the time,  he invested that city with all his forces, and compelled that chieftain to surrender  the place to him and cross over to Africa. The taking of Murcia happened in the  month of Shawwal of the year 484 (a. p. 1091).   The campaign of Murcia being at an end, Seyr next attacked Al]-mu’tassem  Ibn Samédeh, King of Almeria. He sent against him a division of his army  under the command of Abi Zakariyyé Ibn Wasinis, or, according to other au-  thorities, of Mohammed Ibn ’A’yeshah. Having shut himself up in the citadel,  which was of wonderful strength, Ibn Samédeh at first made a stout resistance ;  but hearing that the Almoravides were in possession of the city, and were pre-  paring to invest the citadel, he fell into a low state of mind, and died of sorrow.  His son Hosdmu-d-daulah* then surrendered to the Almoravides, and crossed over  to Africa in a ship which lay at anchor in the bay.   Seyr then marched to Badajoz, where a king of the dynasty of Al-afttas, named  Al-mutawakkel Omar Ibn Mohammed, of whom previous mention has been made,  was reigning at the time. Seyr besieged him [in Badajoz], made him prisoner,",334,book_8,
"    cHapP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 297    and seized on all his dominions and treasures. Some time after he put him to  death, together with his two sons, Al-fadhl and Al-’abbas.   Only Al-mu’tamed remained.® Seyr wrote to acquaint Yisuf with what he  had done, and to ask him for further instructions respecting the Sultan of Seville.  Yiisuf’s answer was, that he should propose to him to cross over to Africa with  all his family and household: if he consented, he was to be nowise molested ;  but if he refused, he was to make war against him and to besiege him in his capital ;  and, when taken, to transport him to Africa, like the rest of the Andalusian rulers.  Accordingly, Seyr sent a messenger to Al-mu’tamed, acquainting him with Yusuf’s  pleasure, and begging to be informed what his intentions were; but Al-mu’tamed  returned no answer; upon which Seyr besieged him in his capital, which he took  by storm, and having made Al-mu’tamed his prisoner, sent him over to Africa  with his family and children, as we are about to relate in the words of an Anda-  lusian writer.   Seyr had no sooner heard of Al-mw’tamed’s disobedience to the .orders of Yusuf  Ibn Tashefin than he prepared to execute that Sultan’s commands. Accordingly,  having detached a portion of his army to Cordova against Al-fat’h Al-mamin,  one of Al-mu’tamed’s sons, he himself, with the remainder of the Almoravides,  marched to Seville. After taking possession of Carmona, which surrendered to  him on Saturday the 27th of Rabi’ the first, before the hour of sunset, Seyr  advanced upon that capital, which he invested. Meantime, Abi ’Abdillah Ibnu-l-  hdj, who went in command of the forces sent against Cordova, after reducing on  his road the cities of Baeza and Ubeda, and the castle of Al-balate, appeared in  sight of that city, which he soon after took by storm, on Wednesday the 3rd  day of Safar.? Al-mamiin was taken prisoner and immediately beheaded. Another  of Al-mu’tamed’s sons, whose name was Yezid Ar-rdédhi, shared a similar fate.  His father had appointed him governor of a strong castle called Ronda, to the  north of Malaga. Seyr having dispatched against him one of his officers, named  Jerdr Al-hashemi,® he was taken and put to death, and his head brought to the  camp of Seyr, who had it paraded on a spear before the walls of Seville.   Al-mu’tamed, seeing himself surrounded by enemies, sent to implore the aid  of Alfonso, who sent an army to his relief; but Seyr having detached ten thousand  horse under an experienced officer, named Abii Is’hik Al-lamttini, the Christians  were kept in check, and did not proceed beyond Almodovar. The siege meanwhile  was prosecuted with unabated vigour; Al-mu’tamed defended himself with great  courage for a whole month, until the Almoravides having fought their way into  the city, he was compelled to surrender. The poet Ibnu-l-lebbinah has preserved  some details of this memorable siege, from which we borrow the following passage :   VOL. II. 2a    Preparations  against Al-  mu'tamed.

"    Taking of Se-  ville by the  Almoravides,    Al-mu’tamed  is conveyed a  prisoner to  Africa.    298 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book viru.    “‘ During the siege of Seville by the Almoravides under Seyr, a party of Al-  ** mu’tamed’s men meditated treason against him; but that Sultan received intel-  “ ligence of their plans, and was enabled to defeat them. Although their crime  ‘* was proved, and he was advised to seize their persons, and take away their lives,  “he was prompted by his magnanimity and his generosity to leave them un-  ‘* molested, and allow them to fly from the city.   “One day Al-mu’tamed quitted his palace to inspect the fortifications and  “ encourage the garrison by his example. He was dressed in a wide tunic [over  ‘‘his armour], and in his hand glittered a sharp scimitar, which soon became  “ notched and tarnished through repeated striking. Having arrived at one of the  ‘ city gates, he found there a warrior renowned for his courage and strength, who  ‘* had just forced his way into the city. The warrior aimed a blow at him with his  ‘* spear; but the weapon buried itself in Al-mu’tamed’s tunic without touching his  “ body. Al-mu’tamed let fall his scimitar on the back of the warrior’s neck, and  “‘made his head roll on the ground. At sight of this exploit,” adds Ibnu-l-  lebbanah, “‘ several of the Almoravides, who were standing on the top of the  ** city walls, threw themselves down, the enemy abandoned the gates of which they  “had taken possession, and directed their steps elsewhere. We all thought that  “after this [manifestation of fear] the city would be freed from the enemy, and  “ that the cloak of protection was once more thrown over us; but we were greatly  “mistaken: on Sunday, the 21st of Rejeb, affairs grew all of a sudden much  ‘‘ worse, and the Almoravides entered the city on the river side.”   Another historian says that the Almoravides took possession of Seville on the  22nd day of Rejeb;® that they had no sooner entered the city than they began  to slay the inhabitants and to plunder their houses. Al-mu’tamed then left his  palace, mounted and armed, taking with him his son Malik, surnamed Fakhru-d-  daulah (glory of the state), who was soon after put to death by the Almoravides,  and trampled under the horses’ feet. After performing prodigies of valour, Al-  mu’tamed returned to his palace, dejected in spirits and torn by affliction. When  night came on, he sent his eldest son, Ar-rashid, to the tent of Seyr Ibn Abi Bekr ;  but the Almoravide general would not receive him, and commissioned one of his  slaves to hear his message. Ar-rashid then returned to his father, and told him  that there was no hope of mercy; upon which Al-mu’tamed took an affectionate  leave of all his family, and, hiding his face in his hands, waited with resignation for  his fate. Shortly after Seyr entered the palace, and having communicated to  Al-mu’tamed the orders of which he was the bearer, told him to prepare to go  to Africa. Accordingly, having embarked with his family and children on board  a galley prepared for him, he sailed under an escort to Tangiers, where he landed in",336,book_8,

Soon after there came an order from Yusuf Ibn Tashefin,  enjoining him to go to the castle of Aghmat; and he was accordingly removed to  that fortress with such among his wives, children, and servants, as consented  to share his captivity. Al-mu’tamed’s eldest son, surnamed Ar-rashid, accompanied  him thither. His name was ’Obeydullah, and his kunyd or appellative Abd-l-hasan.  His father, who destined him for his successor, had caused him some time previous  to be proclaimed as such at Seville. Al-mu’tamed was likewise followed to Aghmét  by his wife *Itimdd, who was the mother of most of his children, to whom he  always was more deeply attached than to any other of his women. Her name  at first was Romeykiyyah, and she was so named from her master, Romeyk Ibn  Hejéj, of whom Al-mu’tamed had purchased her. The surname of ’Itimdd was  given to her by Al-mu’tamed.’ She was a good poetess, and well versed in  literature. She died at Aghmaét some time before her husband.   Historians have recorded many acts of gallantry of Al-mu’tamed towards his  wife Romeykiyyah, among which we select the following one. That princess  happened one day to meet, not far from her palace in Seville, some country women  selling milk in skins, and walking up to their ankles in mud. On her return to  the palace, she said to her royal spouse, ‘“‘ I wish I and my slaves could do as those  “women are doing.” Upon which Al-mu’tamed issued orders that the whole  of his palace should be strewn with a thick paste made of ambergris, musk, and  camphor, mixed together and dissolved in rose-water. He then commanded that  a number of vessels, slung from ropes of the finest spun silk, should be procured ;  and thus arrayed, Romeykiyyah and her maids [went out of the harem and]  splashed in that mud."" It is likewise related that on the same day in which  Al-mu’tamed was deprived of his liberty and throne, some angry words passed  between him and Romeykiyyah, as is often the case between man and wife. In the  middle of the dispute, Romeykiyyah, whose pride was wounded, said to Al-  mu’tamed, ‘“‘ By Allah! I never saw any good come from thee.”—‘ Not even  “ the day of the mud?” inquired Al-mu’tamed, meaning by that the day in which,  to satisfy a mere whim of her’s, he had spent treasures the amount of which no one  but God can estimate. When Romeykiyyah heard this answer she blushed and  kept silence.   Al-mu’tamed remained in confinement till the moment of his death, which  took place four years, or thereabouts, after the taking of Seville by Seyr Ibn Abi  Bekr. Some time before his death one of his sons, named ’Abdu-l-jabbar,  made an attempt to re-establish the power of his family in Andalus; but he  failed, and perished in the undertaking.

An influential citizen of Malaga, named Ibn Khalaf, was put under arrest, together  with other friends and relatives of his, for some misdemeanour of which they were  accused. One day, however, Ibn Khalaf and his comrades broke out of their  prison and fled. Having arrived at night before the castle of Montmaytr (Monte-  mayor), Ibn Khalaf and his followers surprised and expelled the governor, but   His son Abdu- did him no harm. Whilst they were thus engaged, there happened to pass near   l-jabbar revolts   in Andalus. the castle a man whom they did not know at first, but who, upon inquiry, turned  out to be ’Abdu-l-jabbar, son of Al-mu’tamed. Hearing who he was, Ibn Khalaf  and his friends immediately chose him for their commander, and conducted him  to the castle, where he remained, the people [of the country] thinking all the time  that he was Ar-rddhi.'? Some time after a ship, called the ship of Ibn Zaraka,  arrived from Western Africa, and cast anchor in the port of As-sajrah (Sagra),  close to the castle; and the crew, having landed, [entered the castle, and] took  the banners, the drums, and all the stores and provisions which it contained.  In this manner the rebellion increased and spread. The mother of ’Abdu-l-jabbar  then came to the castle ; upon which the prince sent messengers to Algesiras and to  Arkosh (Los Arcos), and seeing that they were well received, repaired thither  in person, and made his entry into that fortress in the year 488 (a. p. 1095).   When Yiisuf Ibn Téshefin heard of the rising of ’Abdu-l-jabbar, he sent orders to  Aghmét to have Al-mu’tamed put in chains. It was in allusion to this that he  composed these two verses :   ‘Chains! do ye not know that I am a Moslem? I will watch at night,  “until ye are moved to pity.  “ Abd Hashim will gaze on ye, until he melts your iron heart.” '3  Meme inthe ’Abdu-l-jabbér, however, did not maintain himself long in his position. No  sooner was Seyr Ibn Abi Bekr apprised of his rebellion, than he sent against him a  body of troops, who besieged him for some months jn his castle of Arcos, until he  was killed by an arrow shot by the enemy. After the death of ’Abdu-l-jabbar,  his partisans still held out, but they were at last overpowered and slaughtered  to a man.  Death of, _ Al-mu’tamed died at Aghmat in the month of Rabi’ the first, of the year 488  (March or April, a.p. 1095). Ibnu-s-seyrafi says in Dhi-l-hajjah of the same year  (Dec. a. p. 1095).* He was born at Beja in the year 431 (beginning Sept. 22,  A.D. 1039), and had occupied the throne of Seville for a period of twenty-seven  years, from 461, when he began to reign, to 488 (a.p. 1095), when he was  dethroned and conveyed to Africa, as above related.   The histories of Andalus are filled with praises of this monarch. ‘‘ Al-mu’tamed,”   says Ibnu-l-katta’, in his work entitled Lamahu-l-malh (sallies of wit),> being a    ",338,book_8,

He was himself an excellent poet, as appears from the many elegant verses which  Al-fat'h, Ibnu-l-hijéri, Ibnu Sa’id, and, above all, Ibnu-l-lebbanah, cite in their  works. The last-mentioned writer, who was one of Al-mu’tamed’s Wizirs, and  visited that prince in his confinement, made a collection of all his verses, as well  as of those of his father and grandfather, which he entitled Saktttu-d-doror wa  lakittu-zohor ft sha’ri-bni ’Abbdd (the falling of the pearls and the spreading of  the flowers: on the poetry of the Beni ’Abbdd).’* Ibn Bessém, in the Dhakhtrah,  gives also many, which he describes as being sweeter than the blooming calyx  of odoriferous flowers. ‘No poet,” he says, ‘‘ ever equalled him in tenderness  ‘‘ of soul, and in the sentiment which prevailed throughout his verses. Wishing  ‘‘ upon one occasion to send the women of his harem from Cordova to Seville,  “he went out and travelled part of the road with them from night till sunrise  ‘‘ of the ensuing day; he then took leave of them, and returned [to Cordova],  ‘* repeating extempore several verses, of which the following two form part :   ‘I accompanied them when night had spread her impervious veil, so as to  ‘ conceal to the sight the traces of the travellers.  ‘ I stopped and took leave [of them]; and the hands of morning stole from  ‘ me those bright stars.’ 7  ‘* This last idea,” observes Ibn Bessdm, “is exceedingly beautiful.”   Among the singular and extraordinary circumstances connected with Al-mu’tamed  one is, that when he was buried at Aghmdat and the funeral service was read over  his tomb, the prayer of the stranger was chanted, as if he had been an adventurer,  without having regard either to the nobility of his birth, or to the extension of  his empire, or the splendour and magnificence of his court; or to his having ruled  over Seville and its districts, Cordova and its Az-zahré. Such, however, are the  ways of this world.   We might fill volumes with anecdotes respecting that prince; but as we have  already given in the seventh chapter of this work several extracts from the  Kaldyidu-l-tikiydn and other works where the biography of Al-mu’tamed is given  at large, we will abstain from dwelling any longer on the subject. Suffice it to say,  that the memory of that illustrious Sultan is still alive in the West, and that  his tomb at Aghmat is well known and much frequented by travellers.

We also visited the tomb of Al-mu’tamed, and that of Romeykiyyah, the mother  of ‘his children, when we were at Morocco in the year 1010 (a.p. 1601). We  arrived at Aghméat, and, not knowing where that prince was buried, we proceeded  to inquire from such of the inhabitants as we chanced to meet. For some time our  inquiries were unsuccessful, but at last an old man, bent with age, showed us  the place, saying, ‘‘ Here lies a king of Andalus, and by his side she whom his  heart loved tenderly.” We recognized the spot, such as Ibnu-l-khattib described  it in his verses,—a gentle eminence. We remained for some time fixed to the  spot, assailed by fear and thought; our mind soon carried us away to the con-  templation of the impenetrable mysteries of Providence, and we could not help  exclaiming, ‘“‘ Praise to Him who gives the empire to whomsoever he pleases !  “‘ There is no God but Him! He is the heir of the earth, and of every thing that  “‘is on it, and he is the best of heirs!” But to resume the thread of our  narrative.   In the year 500, some historians add in the month of Moharram (Sept. a.p. 1106),  died at Morocco the commander of the Moslems, Yusuf Ibn Tashefin. Some time  before his death he had appointed his son Abi-l-hasan ’Ali to be his successor,  and caused him to be recognized as such throughout his African, as well as  Andalusian dominions. They say that when he felt his end approach, Yusuf sent  for him, and recommended to him three things. He was not to disturb the African  tribes inhabiting the gorges of the Atlas or the deserts to the south [of Morocco],  such as the Masmidah and others; he was to conclude a peace with Ibn Hid,  the Sultan of Saragossa, in order to allow him to carry on war against the infidels ;  and, lastly, he was to fix his court at Seville, not at Cordova.

He followed the steps of his able  father, although he fell short of him in some things. In Andalus he kept off  the enemy of God from the dominions of Iskim, and made incessant war on  the Christians. He was equally prosperous in Africa, until God Almighty  decreed the rising of Mohammed Ibn Tuimarta, surnamed Al-mahdi, the founder  of the dynasty of the Al-muwdhhedtiin (Almohades), who ceased not to sap the",340,book_8,
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 303    foundations of the Lamtinite dynasty until he nearly accomplished its ruin ;  for, although he himself never could reduce Morocco, he conquered extensive  provinces, and appointed for his lieutenant and successor ’Abdu-l-mimen Ibn  *Ali, who, in the year 541, took that wealthy capital by storm, and became in  time the ruler of the West.   *Ali crossed four times to Andalus; once in the lifetime of his father. He Be peak  crossed a second time in the year 503 (beginning July 30, a.p. 1109), when of Andalus.  he reached as far as Toledo, and besieged it tor some time. Although he could  not reduce that city, owing to the strength of its walls, he nevertheless took  Talavera, Majoritt (Madrid), Wada-l-haj4rah (Guadalaxara), and other fortresses  and towns of those districts, defeated the Christians whenever they dared show  themselves, and collected incredible spoil. Meanwhile his general, Seyr’® Ibn  Abi Bekr, was inflicting terrible blows upon the Christians of Al-gharb (Algarve),  who, profiting by the absence of the Almoravides, had extended their conquests in  those parts. Seyr retook the cities of Shantireyn (Santarem), Battalids (Badajoz),  Bortokél (Oporto), Yéborah (Evora), and Alishbiinah (Lisbon), and purged the  whole of those western provinces from the filth of the infidels.   Whilst these events were passing, Adefunsh Ibn Radmir (Alfonso I. of Aragon),  king of a nation of Franks called the Barcelonese, was grievously afflicting the  Moslems upon their north-eastern frontier. Having defeated and slain Al-musta’in  Ibn Hiid in an encounter near Tudela,” in a.u. 503, he thought of nothing less than  subjecting the whole of the Thagher (Aragon) to his detestable rule. Accordingly, Taking of a  he kept going backwards and forwards to Saragossa, casting a wistful eye over Aragonese.  that city, and hovering in its immediate neighbourhood, as the hungry vulture  over his prey; but Temim Ibn Ytsuf, whom ’Ali had left to govern Andalus  in his absence, was so much on the alert that the Christian monarch found no  opportunity to carry his wicked plans into execution. At last, in the year 512  (beginning April 23, a.p. 1118), thinking that the time was come to strike a  decisive blow, Alfonso sent [messengers] to the land of Afranjah (France), sum-  moning all the Christian nations there to assist him in his undertaking; and the  people of those countries, having answered his call, flocked under his standard  like swarms of locusts or ants. Alfonso soon found himself at the head of  innumerable forces, with which he encamped before Saragossa. In order the  more effectually to attack the city, he came provided with lofty wooden towers  placed upon wheels, by means of which his men could approach the walls; he  also brought thundering machines”? which he planted against the city, as well  as twenty manjanik or catapults. The siege lasted until the provisions were  exhausted, and the greater part of the population had died of hunger, when",341,book_8,

The [grand-]son of Ramiro granted their request; but as no succour came, the  people of Saragossa were obliged, at the expiration of the truce, to open their  gates and surrender their city to the enemy.* The Christians had not been many  days in possession of Saragossa when a body of twelve thousand cavalry, which  the commander of the Moslems, ’Ali Ibn Yisuf, had sent to its relief, appeared  before the walls ; but finding that the infidels had taken the city, the Almoravides  went away without attempting even to snatch it from their hands. Saragossa,    ‘however, was not the only city which that accursed Christian reduced; he took    also Kal’at Aytib (Calatayud), and other important towns of those districts,*  and soon after he defeated the Almoravides at a place called Kutandah (Cutanda).  “‘ This city,” says a contemporary writer, ‘the name of which some authors  “write with a kef, and others with a kof, is a town of the district of Darikah  ‘« (Daroca), in the province of Saragossa, in the upper Thagher (Aragon). Near  ‘it the Moslems (may God restore them to their pristine vigour!) were com-  ‘« pletely defeated by Alfonso, with the loss of about twenty thousand volunteers,  “although, strange to say, not one of the regular army perished in the action.  “The Moslems were commanded on the occasion by the Amir Ibrahim, son of  “ Yiisuf Ibn Tashefin,® the same prince to whom Al-fat’h dedicated his Kaldyidu-t-  “‘tkiydn. Among the illustrious Moslems who died martyrs for the faith on that  ‘‘ disastrous day, we may count the Sheikh Abd ’Ali As-sadfi, and his equal in  “ virtue and talents, Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Al-faraé. Both went out of Valencia to  “« fight against the enemy of God, but never returned to their friends.”   The Kadi Abé Bekr Ibnu-l-’arabi was also present at the battle, but he escaped  alive. It is related by more than one historian that when the discomfited army  entered Valencia, a man came up to Abi Bekr and asked him how he was, and  that he answered, ‘‘I am like one who has lost both his tent and his cloak,”  thereby meaning that he had lost all that he possessed in this world. The above  is a proverb well known in the West, and it means that whoever has lost his  clothes and his tent has lost every thing in this world.   The news of these disasters induced the commander of the Moslems again to  cross the Strait at the head of his Almoravides. In the year 513 (beginning  April 13, a.p. 1119), he landed at Algesiras, and, after staying some time first  at Seville and then at Cordova, directed his march towards the western provinces  ot Andalus, where he caused the ravages of a storm. His presence, moreover,  was enough to cast terror into the hearts of the enemy, whose stoutest warriors  fled for refuge behind the walls of their castles. Having recovered some of the    ",342,book_8,

Alfonso, the King of Toledo, had, it is true,  died of sorrow and disappointment when he heard that his only son [Sancho], the  heir to his crown, had been slain in a battle with the Almoravides ;* but there  remained to the east of the Mohammedan possessions another Alfonso, who proved  equally destructive to the worshippers of the true God. Elated with his past  successes, and with the taking of Saragossa, he made an incursion into the south  of Andalus, and having traversed the greater part of that country in his march,  arrived before Granada, where he encamped.   According to the author of a history of the Almoravides, entitled Anwdéru-l- Peg este  jaliyyah ft tdértkh daulati-l-mordbetiyyah (the rays of dazzling light: on the history ™  of the Almorabite dynasty),?” the Mu’dhidin or Christian population of Granada *  were the cause of this invasion, for they had frequently written to Ibn Radmir  (Alfonso), inviting him to come among them, and promising to rise in arms  the moment he should show himself in those parts. Accordingly, about the  beginning of Sha’ban of the year 515 (October, a.p. 1121), Alfonso started [from  his dominions] at the head of a numerous and well-appointed army, without  acquainting any one with the object of his expedition, and proceeded to Valencia,  where there was a body of Almoravides under the command of Abi Mohammed  Ibn Yedersen.” After besieging the city in vain for several days, Alfonso raised  his camp and proceeded to Jezirah-Shukar (Alcira), where he was not more  fortunate, for the inhabitants made a valiant defence. He then went to Denia  and to Xatiba, and thence to Murcia, and afterwards to Beyrah (Vera). After  this he crossed the valley of Al-manstrah (Almanzora), descended to Bursénah  (Purchena), and halted some time at Wada Taghlah.*® He then went to Bastah  (Baza), and thence to Wadi-Ash (Guadix), in the neighbourhood of which he  halted, taking up his quarters at a village close to that city, called Al-kasr  (Alcazar). Here Alfonso remained for about a month, making attacks upon the  city of Guadix, which, however, he could not reduce.** After this he marched to  Dejmah*? (Dierma), close to Granada, and encamped there. It was at day-break of  the great festival, or 10th of Dhi-l-hajjah, that the tents of Alfonso were first  seen in the distance in an eastern direction: the inhabitants were thrown into  the utmost consternation by the sight, and the prayer of fear was said in the  mosques ; the people flew to arms and prepared for resistance.

After stopping three  days at that place, Alfonso took the road to Bayénah (Baena), passed by Kabrah  (Cabra), where he halted some days, and went to Al-lusénah (Lucena). Having  received intelligence that the Almoravides of Granada, under the command of  Temim Abi Tahir, were in pursuit of him, he went to Belali,** and thence to  Fahssu-d-danistl, where he was overtaken by the Moslems. A battle ensued,  in which the Moslems had at first the advantage; but their general having given  orders to remove the tents from a low to a high ground, the order was mis-  understood, a panic struck the troops, and the Christians made themselves masters  of their camp.   Alfonso next went towards the sea shore by the road of Shaliibéniah (Salobrefia).  They say that as he crossed the deep and narrow valleys watered by the river  of that name, he exclaimed in his native language, ‘‘ What a fine tomb this would  make, if we had any one to throw the earth over us!” From Shalibdéniah Alfonso  took a western direction and reached the coast of Belesh (Velez-Malaga), where  he caused a small boat to be made, and, sending out people to fish for him, ate  of the fish which they brought him, as if he had made a vow, or wished to have  his memory perpetuated by the exploit. From Velez-Malaga the Christian king  returned once more to Granada, and pitched his tents at a village called Dolar,*  three parasangs south of Granada. After staying two days there he removed to  the town of Hamadan,* in the neighbourhood of which there were some notable  skirmishes between his host and that of the Moslems. Two days after he marched  to Al-faraj, and encamped at a place called ‘Ayn Atesah,*” but perceiving that  the Moslems were surrounding him on every side, he marched in the direction  of Al-bordjelat,** thence to Al-laghtn,®® and lastly to Waédi-Ash (Guadix). Here,  seeing that the cavalry of the Almoravides were close upon him, and that he had  lost a number of his bravest knights, he determined upon returning to his own  dominions. Accordingly he took an eastern direction, and passing by Murcia,  Xativa, Denia, Valencia, &c., reached the capital of his kingdom, not without having  lost in the expedition the best part of his warriors.   It has been said above that the Al-mu’dhidin or Christians living in the territory  of Granada were the principal cause of Alfonso’s invasion, since they had not  only instigated him to penetrate so far into the Mohammedan territory, promising  him every aid and assistance in their power, but they had provided his army with",344,book_8,

At  the solicitation of several respectable citizens of Cordova, Seville, and other places,  the celebrated Kddi Abj-l-walid Ibn Roshd (Averroes) crossed over to Africa,  and, having had an interview with Ali, explained to that Sultan the dangerous  situation in which the Moslems of Andalus were, having to fight enemies abroad  and guard against traitors at home. He besought him to remedy the evil, by  ordering the transportation of the Christians who lived about Granada, and the  other districts lately overrun by Alfonso; and the commander of the Moslems,  yielding to his solicitations, issued the requisite orders, and thousands of that  treacherous population were embarked and removed to Mekndsah, Salé,*° and  other towns of Western Africa.   In the year 515, the commander of the Moslems crossed over again to Andalus, ’Aii goes to   in order to put down some serious disturbances which had arisen in Cordova, fourth fine,  and also to wage war against the infidels. He had not been long in that country  when messengers came to him from Africa, announcing the rising of Mohammed  Ibn Tiumarta, better known in history by the surname of Al-mahdt (the leader).  ’Ali, therefore, crossed over to Morocco, and never afterwards visited his Anda-  lusian dominions, the government of which, as before, he intrusted to his brother  Abi Tahir Temim, and at his death, which happened in 520 (a. p. 1126), to his  own son Tashefin.   *Ali died at Morocco in Rejeb of the year 537 (Jan. or Feb. a.p. 1143). His Death of “ats  death, however, was not made public until three months afterwards.

The whole of his reign—which was of very short duration—  was spent in war with the Al-muwdhhediin or Almohades, whose rising under  his father’s reign we have recorded. Although their leader, Abi ’Abdillah  Mohammed Ibn Tiumarta, had died in 524 (August, a.p. 1130), his successor  *Abdu-l-mimen had since followed in his track, and was fast overthrowing the  tottering empire of the Almoravides. Tashefin fought several engagements with  them, in some of which he came off victorious; but in 539 (a. p. 1144), having  left his capital, Morocco, to attack ’Abdu-l-mimen, he was defeated by that general  near the city of Telemsin, and compelled to take refuge within its walls. Shortly  after, not deeming himself secure there, he fled to Wahrdn, whither he was fol-  lowed by the victorious Almohades. For some time T4shefin defended himself  valiantly ; but at last, seeing that he could not escape the hands of his enemies,  he determined upon leaving the city at night and retiring to a castle which he  had built on the sea shore, hoping to be able from thence to cross over to Andalus.  *Abdu-l-mtimen, however, having received intelligence of his plans, ordered that  the city should be more closely invested, that the sentries should be doubled,  and fires lighted at certain distances in his camp, to prevent the Sultdn’s escape.

"    CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 309    the mountains she fell down a precipice, and the body of Tashefin was found the  next morning stretched at the bottom of a deep ravine.   Tashefin was succeeded by his son Abi Ishak Ibréhim, whom he had left  to command at Morocco during his absence; but ’Abdu-l-mtmen, after reducing  Telemsan, in a.u. 540, and Fez and Salé in 541, marched against that capital,  which he besieged and took in Shawwal, a.u. 541 (March, a.p. 1147), putting  to death the unfortunate Ibrahim, who fell a prisoner into his hands.   During the wars between the Almoravides and Almohades, the Moslems of  Andalus were left a prey to the murderous infidels, who attacked them every  where with the greatest fury, took their cities and towns, and led thousands of  them into captivity. In this manner the Christians of Toledo extended their  ravages to the very walls of Cordova,? and thought of nothing short of establishing  their abominable rites in the very city which had so long been the citadel of Islam.  On the other hand, Alfonso, King of the Franks (Catalonian and Aragonese), whose  conquests we have recorded above, was not inactive ; he surprised several fortresses  bordering upon his dominions, and carried fire and sword into the very heart  of the Mohammedan territory. God, however, was pleased to deliver the Moslems  from the demon’s mischief; for having laid siege to Fraga, a considerable town  of the Thagher (Aragon), the general of the Almoravides * hastened to the assistance  of the besieged, defeated the Christians, and put Alfonso to death. This happened  in the year 528 (a. p. 1134).   The above period [of civil war in Africa] was also remarkable for the rising  of several chieftains, who, seeing the Almoravides engaged with their enemies  the Almohades, took the opportunity to assume independence and to shake off  the African yoke. On his departure for Africa, Tashefin had appointed a Lam-  tinite chief, named Ibn Ghdniyyah [Yahya Ibn ’Ali], to govern Andalus during  his absence; but what with the Christians of every denomination who assailed  his frontiers, and what with the Moslems of Andalus themselves, who showed  every where symptoms of disaffection and wished to rid themselves of the Al-  moravides, that chieftain was unable to stem the torrent of calamity and misfortune  which broke out more furiously than ever in the fair dominions of Islim. At last,  when. the people of Andalus saw that the empire of the Almoravides was falling  to pieces; when they heard that Tashefin had been slain, and that his son, Abi  Is‘h4k Ibrahim, was shut up in his capital and surrounded by his enemies, they  waited no longer, and, casting away the mask of dissimulation, broke out into  open rebellion against their African rulers. In the same manner as at the overthrow  of the house of Umeyyah the provinces of their vast empire had been parcelled  out among their generals and governors, so now every petty governor, chief, or    Conquests of  the Christians.

As some writers,  but especially Ibnu-s-seyrafi, Ibn Séhibi-s-sal4t, and others, have written in detail  the events of this period of confusion and anarchy, which they have designated  by the name of Al-fitnatu-th-thdniyyah (the second civil war), to distinguish  it from that which followed immediately after the massacre of ’Abdu-r-rahman,  son of Al-manstr, we will abstain from relating them here, having done it already  in our work entitled As’hdru-r-riyddh ft akhbdr Kddht ’Iyddh (the flowers of the  garden: on the history of the Kadhi Iyddh). Suffice it to say, that Ibn Hamdin  rose at Cordova; Ibn Maymin [’Ali Ibn ‘Isa] at Cadiz and the neighbouring  districts ; that Ibn Kasi [Ahmed] and Ibn Wazir [Seddaray]* shared among them-  selves the whole of that country which had once belonged to the Beni Al-afttas ;  that a chief named Maymin Al-lamtini rose in command of Granada; and  lastly, that Ibn Mardanish Al-jodh4mi took possession of Valencia and a great  portion of the east of Andalus. Among these chieftains some were of Andalusian  origin, and detested alike the rule of the Almoravides and that of the Almohades ;  others belonged to some of the tribes which Yusuf Ibn Tashefin led into Anda  lus, such as the Lamtinah, Senhdjah, Zendtah, &c., and they were naturally  hostile to the Almohades. All, however, shortly disappeared before the victorious  banners of ’Abdu-l-mimen, who deprived all and every one of them of their  usurped dominions, and subjected the whole of Andalus to his rule. The  last-named chieftain, however [Ibn Mardanish], maintained himself longer than  any other, and fought successfully against the Almohades, as we shall hereafter  relate.   ie stots In the month of Dhi-l-hajjah of the year 539 (June, a.p. 1145), an army of   dalus. Almohades, commanded by Abi ""Imran Misa Ibn Sa’id, landed at Jezirah Tarif  (Tarifa), of which place they took possession, as well as of Algesiras and the  surrounding country. Early in the ensuing year Malaga and Seville shared  the same fate. Three years after, Yahya Ibn Ghdniyyah surrendered to them  the city of Cordova,® and shortly after Jaen. In the year 546 (beginning April 19,  a.p. 1151), ’Abdu-l-mimen announced his intention of crossing over to Andalus.  Having made every ostensible preparation to that effect, he left his capital,  Morocco, and proceeded to Kasr ’Abdi-l-kerim, where he passed his troops in  review ; but the news which he there received from Eastern Africa induced him  to relinquish his purpose and repair to that country. Hearing, however, that  the Moslems of Andalus were much pressed by the Christians, who had lately",348,book_8,
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 311    taken Almeria, he sent thither one of his sons, named Abi Sa’id, with orders to  recover that city. :   Almeriyyah (Almeria) was a fine city situated on the coast of the sea of Sham  (Mediterranean). It was the port of Andalus, and the resort of merchants from  Eastern Africa, Egypt, Syria, and other distant parts. It was the maritime arsenal  of the Beni Umeyyah, and the port where those fleets were equipped which  furrowed in all directions the waters of the Mediterranean, spread devastation  over its shores, and allowed no Christian vessel to sail in it. Almeria was cele-  brated all over the East and West for its pottery, its glass, its silken robes of  every colour and pattern, and many other articles of trade, which its merchants  shipped to all parts of the world. The fertility of the soil, moreover, the abundance  and cheapness of provisions, the sweetness of its waters, the mildness of the air,  and the salubrity of its climate, made it a favourite residence for the Moslems,  who went to settle there from all parts of Andalus, until its population could not  find room within its precincts. All these advantages, and many others which we  do not specify, made Almeria a desirable prize to the Christians, who for a long  time past had cast a wistful eye over its delightful fields and well-filled storehouses.   At last, in the year 542 (a.p. 1147), As-soleytan (Alfonso II. of Castile),® Fear iienty  King of Toledo, assisted by a Christian fleet which came from Jenewah (Genoa),  besieged Almeria by sea and land. Ibn Mardanish, King of Valencia, the only  Moslem who could effectually have defeated the plans of As-soleytdn, entered  into some secret compact with him and kept away: the consequence was, that,  after besieging that city for some time, the infidels lodged themselves in one of  the suburbs, and having from thence attacked the citadel, took it by storm on  Friday, the 20th of Jumada the first, 542 (October 16, a. p. 1147).   It is related by Abi Zakariyyd4 Al-ja’ydi, on the authority of Abi ’Abdillah  Ibn Sa’ddah Ash-shatibi Al-mo’ammar (the long-lived), that about two years or  so before the taking of Almeria, a respectable inhabitant of that city, whose name  was Abi Merwdn Ibn Ward, saw in a dream an old man of imposing height,  who approached him, and, placing his hands suddenly on his sides from behind,  shook him with great violence until he made him wake all terrified; after which  he bade him repeat the following verses :   ‘“‘ Up, up with thee, thou careless and deceived man! do not sleep ;   “‘ For God has some hidden views concerning the people [of this town].   ‘There is no escape, [to his will they must submit,] and yet not abuse  ‘* what is detrimental to them ;   “For otherwise they would be guilty of a crime against the Lord of  “© mankind.” 7",349,book_8,
"    312 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOoK viII.    This happened in the year 540 (beginning June 23, a.p. 1145). About two  years after (a.p. 1147) the Rim (Castilians) took possession of Almeria. The  above anecdote is borrowed from the HA4fedh Ibnu-l-’abbér, who relates it in a  work of his entitled Tekmtlah (complement).   Among those who gained the crown of martyrdom on this occasion one was  the celebrated Im4m Ar-rushatti, whose entire name was Abi Mohammed Ibn  *Ali Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn ’Ali Ibn Khalaf Ibn Ahmed Ibn ’Omar Al-lakhmi Ar-  rushatti Al-meriyi, a man deeply versed in sacred traditions, biography, history,  and other sciences, the author of an excellent work entitled Iktibdsu-l-anwdér wa  iltimdsu-l-azhdr ft nasabi-l-sihdbat wa rawati-l-athdr (the borrowing of lights and  the begging of flowers: on the genealogy of the companions and selected traditions  of their times),® which many a scholar learned under him. It is an excellent  work, in which Ar-rushdtti collected [much that is useful], without failing in  any part of his arduous task. He wrote it on the model of the celebrated Kitdbu-l-  ansdb (book of lineages), by the Héfedh Abi Sa’id Ibn As-sam’dni. Ar-rushdatti  was born at a small town of the province of Murcia, called Auriwelah (Orihuela),  in the year 466 (beginning Sept. 5, a.p. 1073); he died, as above related, at  the storming of Almeria, on the morning of Friday, the 20th of Jumdda the  first, 542 (October 16, a.p.°1147). The surname of Ar-rushdttt was given to  one of his ancestors owing to a large mole on his body, which his nurse, who  was a Christian woman, called in her language rushdttah (roseta), whence he was  called Ar-rushdttt. The above is borrowed from the Wafiyydtu-1-’dydn (the deaths  of the illustrious), by Ibn Khallekan.   Treating of the taking of Almeria [by the Castilians], Ibn Hobeysh, the last  of the traditionists of Andalus, says as follows: ‘‘ I was in the castle of Almeria  “‘ when the Christians took possession of that city, and presented myself to the  “ chief of the Christians, As-soleytan, who was the son of the daughter of Alfonso,  “ and I said to him,—‘ I know of a tradition which traces thy genealogy to Hirkal  ‘* (Heraclius), the Emperor of Constantinople.’ The Christian [king] seemed  “* pleased at this, and told me to repeat the tradition, which I did, as I had  ‘learned it; upon which he said,—‘ Thou and all those who are with thee are  “free; you may go out [of the castle] without paying any ransom.’” This  Ibn Hobeysh was the master of Ibn Dihyah, and of Ibn Haut-illah, and of Abi-r-  rabi’ Al-kal4’i, (may God show them mercy!) His entire name was ’Abdu-r-  rahmén Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Yiisuf, but he was better known by  the surname of Ibn Hobeysh. He was ‘the author of several works, and one in  particular on the first conquests of Isl4m,’° which he inscribed to Abi Ya’kib  Yusuf Al-mansir.    ",350,book_8,
"    CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 313    In the year 545 (beginning April 29, a.p. 1150), Alfonso, King of Toledo Cordova te.  and Galicia (Alfonso II. of Castile), marched to Cordova with forty thousand fowe  cavalry, and laid siege to that capital. The inhabitants defended themselves  with great vigour; but the scarcity of provisions began to be felt, and they were  in great tribulation. *Abdu-l-miimen had no sooner heard of their dangerous  situation, than he sent an army of twelve thousand horse to their assistance. On  the approach of the African forces, Alfonso raised the siege and retired into his  dominions, upon which the Kayid Abi-l-ghamr As-sdyib, who commanded in  Cordova, gave up that city to Yahya Ibn Maymin, who was ’Abdu-l-mimen’s  general, and acknowledged the supremacy of the Almohades. On the morning  of the day following the arrival of Ibn Maymiin, the Christians were seen returning  to their encampment before the city, upon which that general left a portion of his  forces for the defence of Cordova, and with the remainder crossed over to Africa.  Some time after, Alfonso, despairing of reducing that capital, raised the siege and  returned to his kingdom. .   In the ensuing year [a. H. 546] ’Abdu-l-mtimen sent to Andalus another army of ee .  twenty thousand men, under the command of Al-hentéti [Abi Hafss], who had Almeria  instructions to retake the city of Almeria, which, as above related, had some time  previous fallen into the hands of the Christians. When the news of their dis-  embarkation became known, Maymin, the Lord of Granada, Ibn Humushk, and  other chieftains, hastened to pay their respects to the general of ’Abdu-l-mimen,  and to place themselves under the obedience of that Sultén. They all instigated  him to make war against Ibn Mardanish, King of the eastern provinces of Andalus ;  but the latter had no sooner received intelligence of their plans, than, fearing for  himself, he sent an embassy to the Christian Lord of Barcelona, imploring his help  against the Almohades. The Lord of Barcelona granted the request of Ibn Mar-  danish, and sent him an army of ten thousand men, under a brave and experienced  general. Meanwhile the Almohades were marching against Ibn Mardanish; but  when their general [Al-hentéti] heard of the arrival of his Frank auxiliaries, he  retraced his steps and proceeded towards Almeria. Having arrived there, Al-  hentéti invested the city on every side; but the want of provisions soon compelled  him to raise the siege and to return to Seville, where he remained some time.   It was not till some months afterwards that the Moslems succeeded in wresting that  city from the hands of the enemy, after a siege of seven months.   “In the year 546 (a.p. 1151),” says an African historian, “Sid Abi Hafss  “and Sid Abt Sa’id, sons of the Commander of the Faithful, ’Abdu-l-mimen,   “‘ marched to Almeria, and besieged the Christians, who held its kassdbah.

At last, Ibn Mardanfsh, perceiving  “all the shame of his act, in thus attacking his brethren in religion whilst engaged  “ in the extermination of the Christians, desisted from his undertaking and marched  “ off, leaving the execution of his vengeance for another opportunity. When the  ‘“‘ Christians inside the castle [of Almeria] saw Ibn Mardanish raise his tents and  ‘“* go away, they said (to each other], ‘Surely Ibn Mardanish would not decamp,  “ unless he had heard that the Almohades were on the point of receiving re-inforce-  “ ments.’ Upon which they offered to capitulate, and surrendered [the city] to  “ the Moslems.”  Account of the ‘This Ibn Mardanish was a man of Christian origin, who, profiting by the  danish. confusion which followed the overthrow of the Almoravide dynasty, had made  himself the master of Valencia, Murcia, and other towns in the east of Andalus.  According to Ibn Sdahibi-s-salat, who, as is well known, wrote a. history of the  Almohades,"" in which he treats at full length of this and other chieftains who  resisted their authority in Eastern Africa as well as in Andalus, Ibn Mardanish  was the son of Sa’d, son of Mohammed, son of Ahmed, son of Mardanish. His  name was Mohammed, and his kunyd or appellative Abi ’Abdillah. He was,  however, better known by the surname of Ibn Mardanish. His father, Sa’d, had  served under the Almoravides. He was governor of Fraga when Ramiro, King  of the Franks, besieged that city in the year 528 (a.p. 1134). His uncle, Mo-  hammed, surnamed Sdhibu-l-bastt (the hero of Albacete), had also been one of the  most distinguished warriors of his time. Trained to arms under the eyes of his  father and uncle, Ibn Mardanish soon became a very experienced captain. He  entered the service of Ibn ’Ayddh, King of Murcia, who, in reward for his eminent  services, appointed him governor of Valencia, and gave him his daughter in  marriage. On the death of Ibn ’Ayd4dh, Ibn Mardanish retained possession of  Valencia, and shortly after added Murcia, Jaen, and other cities to his dominions.  He was a very powerful monarch when the Almohades arrived in Andalus.’? But  to return.  *Abdu-1- In the year 555 (a. p. 1160), the Commander of the Faithful, ’Abdu-l-mtimen  over toAn.

This Ya’ysh, who was an excellent  engineer, is said to have constructed some wonderful machines during his residence  at Jebal-Térik (Gibraltar), and among others a large windmill, which stood on the  very top of the mountain.   During ’Abdu-l-mtimen’s residence at Gibraltar, the Almohades made several  incursions into the enemy’s territory by his express command. A body of eighteen  thousand horse, having penetrated into the district of Badajoz, defeated Ibn Errink  (Alfonso Enriquez), reduced Bajah (Beja), Yéborah (Evora), Al-kasr (Alcazar  do Sal),'? and other towns which the accursed Christians had taken some time  before, and returned victorious and laden with plunder to the dominions of  Islam.   In the year 556, in the month of Juméda the first (May, a.p. 1161), an Anda- fom, Humush  lusian chieftain named Ibréhim Ibn Humushk, who was the father-in-law of Ibn prise the city  Mardanish, and made common cause with that rebel, took by surprise the city of of Granada  Granada. According to Ibnu-l-khattib this happened thus: ‘‘ Sid Abi Sa’id,  “son of ’Abdu-l-mtimen, who was then governor of that city, having crossed  “over to Africa to assist his father in putting down a rebellion, Ibréhim and  ‘his partisans among the Almoravides thought the opportunity a favourable  “one again to take the field against their enemies, the Almohades. Putting  “ himself at the head of a band of resolute followers, Ibrahim approached Granada  “secretly and at night, and entered it by a gate which his partisans'* had left  ‘open [for him]. Having then attacked the Almohades who composed the  “ garrison, he killed a great many of them and obliged the remainder to take  “refuge in the kassdbah, which he besieged immediately, battering its walls  “and throwing inside all sorts of projectiles. When this intelligence reached  “* Morocco, Abt Sa’id hastened to the assistance of the besieged, taking with him  ‘his own brother, Sid Abi Mohammed Abi Hafss, and a considerable body of  “ African troops. Ibn Humushk, however, was not discouraged by the arrival  “‘ of so powerful an army; he sallied out of Granada, formed his troops in the  “ spot called Merju-r-rokdd (the field of the sleepers), and engaged the Almohades,  ‘* whom he defeated, notwithstanding their superior numbers, making great slaughter  “‘ among them, owing to the trenches and canals into which the plain before that  ‘city is cut up for the purpose of irrigation, and which arrested the flight of  “« the fugitives.

As to Ibn  ‘* Humushk, he returned to Granada with his prisoners, whom he caused to be  “taken near the walls of the kassdbah, and there slaughtered in the presence  Is besieged by “of their friends. Meanwhile the Khalif ’Abdu-l-mimen, who had put down  hades. “ the insurrection, and was then at Salé, being informed of this disaster, dispatched  “another large army to Andalus, under the command of another of his sons,  “ named Abid Ya’kib, assisted by the Sheikh Abi Yusuf Ibn Suleyman, one of  “the bravest and most experienced warriors of the time. These troops, which  “‘ were joined by many thousands of volunteers anxious to wage war against the  “infidels, arrived at Dilar, a hamlet close to Granada, where they encamped.  “This happened in 557 (a.p. 1162). Meanwhile Ibn Humushk, seeing the  “ tempest gather over his head, had sent to apprise his son-in-law, Ibn Mardanish,  “ of his perilous situation, and to beg him to come to his assistance. No sooner  “had Ibn Mardanish received the message, than having quickly raised in his  “‘ dominions an army composed of Christians and Moslems, he hastened to his aid  ‘‘ and encamped with his forces on an eminence close to the suburb inhabited by the  “ people of Baeza (Albayzin), which still bears his name, Kudyat Ibn Mardantsh  ‘* (the hillock of Ibn Mardanish). The two armies came soon after to an engage-  ‘* ment in the Vega of Granada, when, after a bloody and hard-contested battle,  ‘ fortune decided in favour of the Almohades, and Ibn Mardanish fied to Jaen.  Leena “ Some time after this, Ibn Humushk and his son-in-law having quarrelled,  “the former made his submission to the Almohades. The cause of their quarrel  ‘‘ was this: Ibn Mardanish divorced his wife, the daughter of Ibn Humushk,  ‘‘ who, accordingly, returned to her father. Having, some time after, sent for  “a son of hers to be educated at her father’s house, her late husband refused  “to comply with her request, and would never deliver up her son. At last,  “‘ seeing her application disregarded, the mother said one day,—‘ After all, what  “‘is the son of a dog but a puppy? Let him keep him; I do not want him;’  ‘‘ which expressions she caused to be circulated among the women of Andalus.  “From that moment Ibn Mardanish and Ibn Humushk became sworn enemies,  ‘and the latter, in order the better to revenge himself, embraced the party of the  ‘** Almohades in 565 (beginning Sept. 24, 1169), and served under them against  “ Tbn Mardanish. In the year 571 (beginning July 21, a. p. 1175), however, Ibn  ‘“‘Humushk asked for leave to cross over to Africa, and, having obtained it,  “* settled with his family and children at Mekndsah, where he died in Rejeb of  “« 572 (January, a. p. 1177).”  Death of In the year 558 (a. p. 1163), ’Abdu-l-mimen made public his intention to cross    aaa over to Andalus, and summoned the tribes of the Desert to engage in the holy",354,book_8,

On the death of ’Abdu-l-mimen, his son Ytsuf, surnamed Abi Ya’ktb, received  the oaths [of the Almohades]. When the affairs of the government had been  settled, and the foundations of the kingdom strengthened, Yiisuf crossed over  to Andalus, in order to exhibit in that country the benefits of his government.  This happened in 566 (beginning Sept. 13, a.p. 1170). He landed in Andalus,  accompanied by ten thousand horse of the Almohades and Arabs, and proceeded  to Seville, where he fixed his court.   Some time before the landing of Yusuf, a Christian named Ibn Errink (Alfonso  Enriquez) had been committing great depredations in the western parts of Andalus,  and had even reduced some considerable towns,’ as Turjeloh (Truxillo), Yéborah  (Evora), Kaseresh (Cazeres), and others; but Ytisuf had no sooner arrived in  Seville than the accursed Christian shut himself up in his stronghold, and the  Moslems were for some time delivered from his mischief.   Yusuf’s arrival had also the effect of checking the progress of Abi ’Abdillah  Mohammed Ibn Sa’d Ibn Mardanish, who, as before related, ruled undisturbed  over Murcia and the greater part of Eastern Andalus; for no sooner did he hear  of that Sultan’s landing than fear lodged in his heart, and he fell dangerously ill and  died: some authors say that he was poisoned.   On the death of Ibn Mardanish, his sons and relatives presented themselves  to the Commander of the Faithful, Yusuf, then residing at Seville, placed them-  selves under his rule, and delivered the whole of their dominions into his hands.",356,book_8,

This being done, the Commander of the Faithful began to give his serious  consideration to retaking from the Christians those districts and towns which they  had subdued [under the preceding reigns]. After a successful campaign his  dominions were considerably enlarged, and his victorious army ravaged the  Christian territory to the very gates of Toledo, which city he is said to have Yisuf ays  besieged [for a length of time]. But all the Christian nations of Andalus having leds. ‘oe  collected their forces to attack him, and famine, moreover, having seized on  his army, he was compelled to raise the siege and to return to Morocco, the  capital of his [African] dominions. From thence he proceeded to Eastern Africa,  and having appeased the troubles which agitated that country, returned to Morocco.   In the year 580 (beginning April 13, 4. p. 1184), the Commander of the Faithful Dies before  again crossed over to Andalus at the head of considerable forces. This time he  directed his march towards the western provinces, and laid siege to Shantireyn  (Santarem), one of the greatest cities of the enemy. He remained encamped  before it for a whole month, until he was attacked by a disease which caused his  death in the same year [a. H. 580]. He was carried on a litter to Seville. Others  say that he was killed by an arrow shot by the Christians ;? but God only knows  the truth of the case. It was Yusuf who ordered the building of the great mosque  of Seville,—which, however, was not completed till the reign of his successor,—  and who put the maritime arsenal of Ceuta in its present efficient state.   Yusuf was succeeded by his son Abi Yusuf Ya’ktb, surnamed Al-mansir-billah it ey,  (the victorious by the grace of God), a monarch whose fame travelled far and wide, mansir.  who upheld the glory of the Almohade empire, who raised the banners of holy war,  suspended the balance of justice, and spread the decrees of civil law,—rendered  Islam triumphant, ordained what is right and forbade what is wrong, and made his  orders obeyed over near as well as distant [lands], of all which acts history affords  abundant records. During the reign of this Sultan the Christians of Andalus received  many a severe blow, for he triumphed over them on several occasions, and prin-  cipally at Alarcos, where the victory equalled—if it did not surpass in importance  —the celebrated one of Zalikah. The learned and celebrated poet, Abi Is’hak  Ibrahim Ibn Ya’ktib Al-kénemi, a black of Stidén, has said in allusion to. this  Sultdn,—   “Well may his Hajibs conceal him from my view; my reverence [for him]  ‘is such that I see his image on the curtain.   ‘My knowledge of his virtues prompts me to approach, but fear and  “ respect fix me to my place.” *",357,book_8,

The first thing that he did on his taking possession  “‘ of the command was to direct his attention towards Andalus and to inquire  “into the state of that country. Having collected a numerous army, he landed  ‘“‘at Algesiras on Thursday the third of Rabi’ the first of the year 585 (April 20,  ““a.p. 1189), and started immediately for the west of Andalus, where he com-  “‘ mitted the ravages of the tempest. He then proceeded to Seville, and after  “ providing for the welfare of the country in general, and steadying the warriors  “ in their ranks, he returned to Morocco, the capital of his dominions.”   Again, in the year 586 (beginning Feb. 7, a.p. 1190), having received intelli-  gence that the Franks had taken Shilb (Silves), one of the principal cities of  Al-gharb, Ya’kib marched thither in person at the head of considerable forces,  and having laid siege to the city, restored it to the rule of Islam. Immediately  after he sent forward [into the enemy’s country] a large army of Arabs and  Almohades, which reduced four other towns of those which had been taken by  the Christians forty years before. The Lord of Toledo [Alfonso II. of Castile]  feared Ya’ktib, and asked him for a truce, which he granted to him, to last for  five years, after which he returned to Morocco. It was on this occasion that  the K4yid Abé ’Abdillah Ibn Wazir Ash-shelbi (from Silves), one of the general  officers of the army stationed at Seville, composed that beautiful ode, in which  he addresses Al-manstir, and congratulates him upon his successful campaign  against the Christians. Abi ’Abdillah had attended the expedition as commander  of the van. The ode begins thus :   “‘When we met, the spears were crossed, and the blows [followed each  ‘ other] like the revolutions of the millstone.   “The sharp Indian swords sported on our necks and on those of our  “ enemies ; some [of us] kept their saddles, and some fell ;   “‘ Not a breast but what had an arrow fixed in it; not a jugular vein but  ‘‘ what had afforded a lodging to the scimitar.   “« We fought until no refuge was left save the helmet and the spear, and the  “ greatest courage was displayed on both sides.   “* At last we charged and they staggered; [the victory was ours], for the  ‘* stageerer soon after falls.”’ *   This Abi ’Abdillah was a very experienced officer and an excellent poet. An-  nasir, one of the Sulténs of the posterity of ’Abdu-l-mimen, appointed him  governor of Kasr Abi Dénis; but when Ibn Hid, who afterwards rose against  the Almohades, made his entrance into Seville, he caused Abi ’Abdillah, [who was  residing there,] to be arrested and put to death.",358,book_8,

When the truce made with the Christians was  over, or nearly so, a large party of them invaded the Moslem territory, and  began to plunder and lay waste the country, and to commit all manner of ravages  and depredations, which being reported to Al-mansir, who was then absent in  Africa, he resolved upon chastising their insolence. Having, accordingly, collected  a numerous and well-appointed army, that Sultén crossed the Strait and landed  at Jezirat Al-khadhré (Algesiras), in Rejeb of the year 591 (a.p. 1195). The  Christians of Andalus were no sooner informed of the landing of Ya’ktb, than  they began to collect troops from the most remote parts [of Christendom], which  being done, they marched against the Almohades. They say that soon after his  arrival at the port of Salé for the purpose of crossing over to Andalus, Ya’kib  fell so dangerously ill that his physicians despaired of his life, upon which Alfonso,  who was aware of the Sultdn’s indisposition, sent him an embassy, threatening,  abusing, bragging, and thundering; asking to be put in possession of some of  the fortresses bordering upon his dominions. The result, however, is well known ;  Ya’kiib met the infidels at the head of his forces, and gained over them a victory  which equalled, if it did not surpass in importance, the victory of Zalaékah. Indeed,  some writers assert that it exceeded it in every respect.   Alfonso with his Christian auxiliaries having encamped at Alark (Alarcos), a spot Battle of  in the district of Badajoz,® Ya’kib marched thither at the head of his forces, and “""""""  the two hosts were soon in presence of each other. Some time before the battle,  Ya’ktib devised the following stratagem. Knowing that the Christians would attack  in preference that part of the camp where he himself was, he bade his kinsman,  the Sheikh Yahya Ibn Abi Hafss, change place with him, and to occupy with his  troops the space round the royal pavilion. This Ibn Abi Hafss was the uncle  of Abi Zakariyyé Al-hafssi, who afterwards became Sultan of Eastern Africa,  as well as of a portion of Andalus whose inhabitants said the khotbah in his name.  It happened as Ya’kiib had foreseen. The Christians, thinking that the banners  in the middle of the camp marked the spot where Ya’kib and his body-guard  were, directed a most furious attack upon that quarter; but it availed them not ;  for they had exchanged only a few blows with the Moslems, when Ya’kub fell un-  expectedly upon them and defeated them most completely.   This memorable battle was fought on Thursday, the 9th of Sha’ban, a. 4. 591  (a. D. 1195), which year, moreover, is well known all over the West as ’A’mu-l-alark  (the year of the battle of Alarcos). Never was there a more signal victory gained  by the Moslems of Andalus. It is said that the loss of the Franks amounted to one  hundred and forty-six thousand men, besides thirty thousand prisoners. The amount  of spoils, too, said to have been gained on this occasion is almost incredible: some   VOL. II. 2T",359,book_8,
"    322 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN {Book vir.    authors say one hundred and fifty thousand tents, eighty thousand horses, one hundred  thousand mules, and four hundred thousand asses ; as the infidels, having no camels,  used those animals to carry their baggage. Another account says sixty thousand  suits of armour, and that the horses, mules, &c., were innumerable. As to the  money and jewels, they were beyond calculation. A captive sold for one dirhem, a  sword for half a dirhem, a horse for five, and an ass for one. All this spoil Ya’kib  divided among the Moslems agreeably to law. The relics of the Christian army  fled to Kal’At Rab&h (Calatrava), where they fortified themselves; but the Sultan  Ya’kuib followed them thither, and, after besieging them some days, took possession  of the place. The Christian king, Alfonso, fled to Toledo with a few followers,  in the worst possible plight. They say that when he arrived in that city, he  had his head and beard shaved, turned his cross upside down, and swore not to  sleep in bed, approach a woman, or mount a horse or mule, until he had revenged  his defeat. He then began to collect troops and warlike stores from distant islands  and countries; but he was again met by Ya’kiib, who, having defeated him,  pursued him to Toledo, which city he besieged and battered with war engines,  until he was on the point of taking it. The mother of Alfonso, accompanied by his  wives and daughters, then came out of the city, and, with tears in her eyes,  implored the conqueror to spare the city. Being moved to compassion, Ya’kib  not only granted the request, but, after paying them due honour, he dismissed  them with splendid presents in jewels and other valuable articles.’ The Amir then  returned to Cordova, where he passed a month occupied in the distribution of  the spoil among his soldiers. Whilst there, ambassadors came to him from King  Alfonso to sue for peace, which the Amir granted, as he had just heard of the  rising in Eastern Africa of Al-mayiirki,? who was assisted in his rebellion by  Korkiish, the mameluke of the Beni Ayib, Sultans of Syria.and Egypt; so that  the people of Andalus for some time enjoyed security and rest.   After a prosperous reign of fourteen years and eleven months, Ya’kib Al-manstr  died at Morocco, on Friday, the 22nd of Rabi’ the first, a. H. 595 (Feb. a. p. 1199).  His body was conveyed to Tinmelel, where it was buried by the side of his father  and grandfather. As to the report that this Sultan abdicated his royal power, and  travelled to Syria, where he died and was interred in the district called Beka’h,°  there is not the least foundation for it, although Ibn Khallekan says something  to that purpose. No author, however, has so well exposed the unsoundness of  such a statement as the Sherif Al-gharndtti (Abi-l-késim Mohammed) in his  commentary upon the Makssiirah of Ibn Hazem, who says, ‘‘ This is one of the  “* stories of the vulgar, who were in love with that Sultan.” Ya’kib completed the  building of the great mosque of Seville,’° and erected several useful or ornamental",360,book_8,
"    CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 323    works in other parts of his dominions. He was a powerful monarch, dreaded by  his enemies and respected by his equals. In the year 587 the Sultén Saléhu-d-din  (Saladin), son of Ayvib, sent an embassy to solicit his aid against the Franks  who had attacked him on the coast of Palestine ; but this Ya’kib would not grant,  because Saldhu-d-din had not in his letter addressed him by the title of Amtru-I-  mimenin (Commander of the Faithful). Such, however, was Ya’ktb’s benevolent  disposition that, although highly offended with Saléhu-d-din, to whom he returned  a despicable present, he rewarded munificently the ambassador of that Sultan,  whose name was Ibn Munkid; having given him on one occasion, for a poem  of forty verses,"" forty thousand dirhems, being at the rate of one thousand for  each verse, adding, when he gave him that large sum, “‘ This we give thee, not  _ for Saléhu-d-din’s sake, but for thy learning and poetry.” Ibn Munkid left  Andalus in 588 (a. p. 1192).   Ya’kiib Al-manstir was succeeded by his son Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed, Accession of  surnamed An-ndsir lid{n-illah (the defender of the faith), whose reign proved 80 Annisin  fatal to the cause of the Moslems, and principally to those of Andalus; since,  having in the year 609 (a. p. 1212) collected an army amounting to six hundred  thousand warriors, he not only accomplished nothing advantageous to the cause  of religion, but actually sustained one of the most complete defeats that ever  disgraced the arms of Islam. The author of the Adh-dhaktratu-s-saniyyah ft  tértkhi-d-daulati-l-mertniyyah (the valuable treasure: on the history of the Merinite  dynasty),'? says that Mohammed was so astonished and pleased with the number of  his troops that he thought himself invincible. The Franks, on the other hand,  made [ample] preparations [to resist him], and they fought the celebrated battle of  Al-’ak4b, which the Moslems lost, and the result of which was that the greater The Moslems  part of Maghreb was deserted and that the Franks conquered the greater part of of ALakkb oF  Andalus. Out of the six hundred thousand men who entered the field of battle“  only a few escaped; some authors even state that their number did not reach  one thousand. This battle was like a curse, not only to Andalus, but to the whole  of Maghreb, and the defeat is to be ascribed to the bad policy of An-ndsir; for, It fatal re-  although the Moslems of Andalus were well trained to war and accustomed to""  fight with the Christians, that Sultan and his Wizir entirely disregarded their  advice, and even offended some of them; and the consequence was that the minds  of the Andalusian officers were alienated and the Christians gained an easy  victory. However this may be, certain it is that this defeat may be regarded as  the real cause of the subsequent decline of Western Africa and Andalus,—of the  former country, because the loss sustained in the battle was so great that. her  districts and towns were almost depopulated through it,—of Andalus, because the",361,book_8,

At last the Andalusian chieftains  and the descendants of the Arabs of the time of the Beni Umeyyah, such as  Mohammed Ibn Yisuf Ibn Hid Al-jodh4mi, Ibn Mardanish, and others, united  together and expelled them from the country, as we shall hereafter relate.   On the death of An-ndsir, which happened.at Morocco in Sha’bdn of the year  616 (Oct. or Nov. a.p. 1219), his son Abii Ya’ktb Yusuf Al-mustanser (he who  implores the help of God), succeeded him; but as he was fond of pleasure and  repose, the affairs of the Andalusian Moslems, far from improving, went on declining  rapidly, and the empire of his family became still weaker. He died without  posterity at Morocco on the 12th of Dhi-l-hajjah, 620 (Jan. a. p. 1223), and was  succeeded by his father’s uncle, ’Abdu-l-w4hed Ibn Yusuf Ibn ’Abdi-l-mtmen,  whose rule, however, was not more prosperous than that of his predecessors. A  relative of his, named Al-’4dil Ibn Al-manstir, who was then at Murcia in Andalus,  considering himself more entitled to the crown than his kinsman, raised the standard  of revolt, and was proclaimed without opposition in all those towns which acknow-  ledged the rule of Islam in that country.   *Abdu-l-wéhed’s rule was not of long duration; for no sooner had the news  of Al-’4dil’s revolt reached Morocco, than he was deposed and strangled there  on the 21st of Sha’bén, 621 (a.p. 1224). Meanwhile the Christians of Andalus  were stirring against Al-’4dil, who marched against them at the head of his forces.  Having, however, fought a pitched battle with them, he and the Moslems under  his orders sustained a most severe and shameful defeat, which was like an ulcerated  wound [to the body of Isl4m]. At last Al-’ddil fled over the Straits, and landed  in Africa with the intention of going to Morocco, leaving a brother of his, named  Abi-l-’ala Idris, to command at Seville during his absence. After some negotia-  tion [with the Sheikhs of the Almohades], Al-’ddil entered Morocco ; but shortly  after, the same parties, having risen against him, secured his person, and appointed  in his stead Yahya, son of An-ndsir (Yusuf II.), a youth without experience, and  totally incapable of conducting the affairs of the Moslems.   On the receipt of this intelligence, Abi-l-’ala Idris assumed the title of Khalif at  Seville, and was immediately proclaimed by the Moslems of Andalus under the  surname of Al-mdmuin (the trusted by the grace of God). In the course of time he",362,book_8,
"    CHAP. 111.] DYNASTIES IN 8PAIN. 325    was also recognized at Morocco, although he would still dwell in Andalus. At  last an Andalusian chief, named Mohammed Ibn Yusuf [Ibn Hid) Al-jodhdmi,  having revolted against him and defeated his troops in several encounters, Idris  was compelled to abandon Andalus to him, and to cross over to Africa, where he  ceased not to carry on war against Yahya Ibn An-ndsir, until he put him to death  in the year 633 (beginning Sept. 15, a.p. 1235), and became the only ruler of  Western Africa; although, as above related, the empire of Andalus was for ever  lost to him and to the Sultans of his race.   Idris died in the year 640 (beginning June 30, a. p. 1242), and was succeeded As-se’id.  by his brother * As-sa’id (Idris II.), who was killed near a castle distant one day’s  march from Telemsén, in 642 (beginning June 8, a.p. 1244).

Al-wdthik himself was slain  in the year 668 (beginning August 30, a.p. 1269) by the Beni Merin, who sub-  jected the whole of Western Africa to their rule.

Ipris AL-MAMUN was, as before stated, the last Sultén of the posterity of ’Abdu-l-  miimen who held rule in Andalus, for his successors were too much occupied  in Africa, where the Beni Merin were daily assailing their empire, ever to think  of reconquering their dominions across the sea. The Moslems of Andalus then  perceiving the helpless state in which they were left, turned their eyes in another  quarter, and began to look about among themselves for men capable of conducting  the government in those perilous times, and stemming the torrent of Christian  invasion. °   cast ot Mohammed Ibn Yiisuf Al-jodh4mi was descended from Al-musta’in Ibn Hid,  fourth Sultén of Saragossa of the dynasty called the Beni Hid. According to  Ibnu-l-khattib the cause of his revolt was as follows: about the time that the  dynasty of the Almohades began to show visible signs of decay, there prevailed  an impression among the people of Murcia and other cities in the east of Andalus,  that the power of their African rulers was shortly to be overthrown by a man  named Mohammed Ibn Ytisuf, who would rise in arms against them, expel them  from the country, and restore the Mohammedan empire to its pristine power and  splendour. Other authors assert that it was an astrologer who communicated   Prophecy in that information to one of the Almohades, saying, ‘‘ There will soon rise in this   mis Mou as country against you a man from the ranks of the army whose name will be Mo-  ‘‘ hammed Ibn Yiisuf,” and that by order of the prince, to whom the information  was communicated, a strict search was made all over Andalus, when all those  who bore that name were put to death without mercy, and among them a citizen",364,book_8,
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 327    of Jaen. They add that Ibn Hid was not aware at first either of the existing  prophecy or of the orders issued for the apprehension of all those bearing a name   similar to his. One day a wise man, dressed in the garb of a faquir, came up   to him in Murcia and said, ‘‘ Why art thou still here? Dost thou not know   “that a kingdom awaits thee? Away, away! Look for Al-kashi,! and he will   ‘pave thee the way to power.” This Al-kashi was nothing more than a cele-   brated brigand, who, at the head of a few desperadoes, infested the roads about  Murcia, and practised all manner of cruelties and extortions upon the country   people, or the travellers who fell into his hands. On the ninth of Rejeb of the   year 625 (June 13, a.p. 1228), Ibn Hiid left Murcia secretly and joined Al-kashi,   to whom he imparted what the faquir had told him. The brigand chief received   him kindly, and, as he knew him to be descended from kings, had no difficulty   in giving up to him the command of his small force. Shortly after, the two chiefs, ee  having made an incursion into the Christian territory, returned to their usual Murcia  haunts, with many captives and rich booty, which being divulged, soon brought   them numbers of adventurers anxious to enlist under their banners. Little by   little, Ibn Hiid’s partisans increased, until, seeing himself at the head of a respectable   force, he caused himself to be proclaimed [king] by his men at a place called  As-sokheyrah,? in the neighbourhood of Murcia. At the news of this rebellion,   Sid Abi-l-’abbés, at that time governor of Murcia, left that city at the head of  considerable forces, and attacked Ibn Hiid; but he was defeated with great loss,   and obliged to return to the seat of his government. Shortly after the inhabitants Subdues the  of Murcia rose against their governor, expelled him and his Almohades, and pro- Sandalus.  claimed Ibn Hud, who repaired thither at the head of his forces, and made his  triumphant entry about the end of 625, or the beginning of 626. Denia, Xatiba,   and other cities of the east of Andalus soon followed the example of Murcia.   Ibn Hid himself reduced Granada, Malaga, and Almeria; and towards the close   of the year 626 (Nov. a.p. 1229), Cordova, Jaen, and other important cities,   sent also their allegiance to him. Seeing himself the sole master of Andalus,   Ibn Hiid hesitated not to assume the title of Améru-l-moslemin (commander of   the Moslems), and to dispatch an embassy to Al-mustanser Al-’abbasi, the reigning Proctaims the  Khalif at Baghddd, requesting to be allowed to hold his dominions from him, Baghdad.  and to mention his name in the public prayers. Ibnu-l-khattib relates that the  ambassadors returned to Andalus in 631 (beginning Oct. 6, a. p. 1233), bringing a  favourable answer from the Khalif, together with a letter granting Ibn Hid the  investiture of all the dominions which he then held or might acquire in future. That   Sult4n was then at Granada, and he ordered that the letters of the Khalif should   be read to the people, which was done in the principal mosque of the place.",365,book_8,
"    328 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book vill.    Ibn Hid himself was present at the ceremony, and he stood dressed in the sable  uniform [of the ’Abbdssides], and holding in his right hand a black banner. The  same historian adds that the day when the ceremony took place happened to  be one in which prayers for rain had just been said, and that no sooner was  the Khalif’s letter read to the people than the sky was suddenly obscured by  clouds, and the rain began to fall in torrents. On this occasion Ibn Hid assumed  the honorary surname of Al-mutawakkel ’ala-illah (he who relies on God).   i nanlareig Ibn Hiid did not long enjoy in peace his newly-acquired sovereignty. Other   authority. Chieftains rose in various parts of Andalus, and either assumed the same titles  and authority which he had usurped, or refused peremptorily to acknowledge him  as their sovereign. Among the former was Ibnu-l-ahmar [Mohammed Ibn Yisuf],  who, in the year 629 (beginning Oct. 28, a. p. 1231), rose at Arjona, and having  made himself master of Jaen, Granada, Malaga, and even Cordova and Seville,  became eventually the sole ruler of Andalus, and the founder of a powerful dynasty.  Among the latter we may count Abi Jemil Zeyydn Ibn Mardanish, a descendant of  that Mohammed Ibn Mardanish whose wars with the Almohades we have elsewhere  related. This chieftain, who enjoyed considerable power and influence in the  eastern districts of Andalus, made himself master of Valencia and the surrounding  country, where he maintained himself until the accursed Christians reduced that  city in the year 636 (a. p. 1238), as we shall hereafter relate.   Another chief, named, Al-baji (Abi Merwdn Ahmed), of the posterity of the  celebrated theologian Abi-l-walid Al-bdji, revolted at Seville, and held the sove-  reignty of that place until he was treacherously slain in 631 by a lieutenant of  Ibnu-l-ahmar. , :   The Christians © Whilst the above-mentioned chieftains divided among them the provinces of  SaaiBaaagae Andalus, or were at war against each other, the Christians of every denomination  were furiously assailing the dominions of Islam. In the year 627 (beginning  Nov. 19, a.p. 1229), for instance, they occupied the whole province of Merida,  and from that time woe and perdition fell to the lot of the wretched inhabitants  of that once flourishing district (may God restore it to the rule of Islam!). Merida  had been the capital of Al-jauf,? both in the times preceding the [Arabian] conquest,  and in those of the Cordovan Khalifate; but subsequently‘ the city of Badajoz  became the court and residence of the rulers of those districts. Between Merida  and Cordova the distance is five days’ journey. As before stated (p. 256), Merida,  Badajoz, and the neighbouring districts had formerly been subject to Al-modhaffer  Mohammed Ibn Al-mansitr Ibn Al-afttas, a personage well known in history, and  whose biography may be read among those of the illustrious men of the Dhak-  itrah and Kaldyid: he was without dispute the most learned and accomplished    ",366,book_8,

His son Al-mutawakkel (’Omar Ibn Al-afttas] was likewise one of  the [eminent] men mentioned in the Dhakhtrah, Kaldyid, and Mas‘hab. But to return.   Ever since the rebellion of Ibn Hid and the departure of Idris Al-m4nuin for  Africa, the whole of Al-gharb or Western Andalus had acknowledged the rule  of the former. Accordingly, no sooner did the people of Merida, Badajoz, Cazeres,  and other towns of those districts, hear of the arrival of the Christians among them,  than they sent to implore the assistance of Ibn Hiid, who hastened thither at the  head of his best troops. Ibn Hud found the Christian king (Alfonso IX. of Leon)  encamped before Merida, which he was besieging. He attacked him with great  fury, and was at first successful; but in the end his troops were worsted, and  he was compelled to relinquish his enterprise. Shortly after the Christians took  possession of Merida,® and some time after of Badajoz.   “At the time that the people of Andalus rose against the descendants of Attack and  * *Abdu-l-mimen, Abi Yahya Ibn Abi ""Imran At-tinmeleli was governor of fland of Mal-  ‘‘ Mallorca.” In his days the island was taken by the Franks.” Such are the tore  words of Ibnu Sa’id. Ibnu-l-abbar places the conquest of that island on Monday,  the 14th of Safar, a.m. 627 (Jan. 12, a.p. 1230). Al-makhziimi, in his history  of Mallorca, gives the -following details :—‘‘ Mallorca was governed at the time  “by an Amir, named Mohammed Ibn ’Ali Ibn Misa, who, being a man of quality  “and influence among the people of the extinct dynasty of [the Almohades], had  “ been intrusted with the government [of the Balearic Islands], which he held  “ ever since 606 (beginning July 5, a.p. 1209). Happening once to want some  ‘‘ timber, which in the neighbouring island of Iviza is very abundant, Mohammed  “sent thither some light vessels under the convoy of a few of his war galleys.  “‘ The Christian governor of Tortosa, having received intelligence of the departure  ‘ of the expedition, sent out a fleet to capture the Moslem vessels, and succeeded ;  “ upon which Mohammed was so angry at the loss of his ships that he resolved  ‘‘upon declaring war against the Christians and making a descent upon their  “territory. In an evil hour did he form such a determination; for he lost his  “dominions in the contest. An occasion soon presented itself for carrying his  ‘* project into execution. About the end of Dhi-l-hajjah of the year 623 (Dec.  “a.D. 1226) news came to him that a vessel from Barcelona had appeared in  ‘“‘ sight of Iviza, and that another ship from Tortosa had also come up with it.  ‘* Upon the receipt of this intelligence, Mohammed dispatched his son with some   VOL.

"    330 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book vilI.    “armed vessels in chase of the enemy. The son of Mohammed having entered  “the harbour of Iviza, found lying there at anchor a large Genoese galley, which  “he attacked and took. This done, he sailed in chase of the Barcelonese ship,  ‘‘ which he likewise boarded and took. This trifling success had the effect of  “ completely turning the head of the governor of Mallorca, who from that moment  “ fancied himself a conqueror, and thought that no king could resist his victorious  “ arms, forgetting that he was as ill-fated as the camel cursed with sterility, and that  “the Christians would not fail to take ample vengeance for the injury they had  “‘ received. And so it happened; for the people of Barcelona had no sooner heard  “* of the capture of their vessel, than they said to their king, who was of the posterity  “ of Alfonso,® ‘How does the king like to see his subjects used in this manner?  ‘* We are ready to assist thee with our persons and our money to revenge this  “ insult.’ The king, taking them at their word, immediately raised an army of  ‘twenty thousand men in his dominions, and, having equipped a considerable  “ fleet, set sail for Mallorca with upwards of sixteen thousand soldiers. This took  ** place in 626 (a. p. 1228) ; but as these immense preparations could not be made  ‘* secretly, the news of the armament soon reached the governor of Mallorca, who  “ began also to collect his forces, and prepared to repel the invasion. Having  “ selected upwards of one thousand cavalry, he distributed them about the island,  ‘and he raised besides another body consisting of one thousand horse from among  “the country people and the inhabitants of the capital; his infantry amounted  “to eighteen thousand men. All these levies were ready by the month of Rabi’  “the first, of the said year (a.p. 1228). Unluckily; however, all these active  “« preparations were counteracted by the following unfortunate event. One day  ‘‘ Mohammed ordered the captain of his guards to bring into his presence four  “of the principal inhabitants of the town, and when, in pursuance of his order,  “ they appeared before him, he caused them to be immediately beheaded. Among  ‘ the number of these victims were two sons of his mother’s brother, Abi Hafss Ibn  “ Sheyri, a man of rank and influence in the island. The people went to him  “and related what had occurred, warning him against the tyrant, and saying,  « « By Allah! this state of things can no longer be endured; the Amir is not fit  “* either to govern us or defend us, and as long as he rules our lives will be entirely  “at his mercy.’ After this declaration, the citizens bound themselves to revenge  “ the blood spilt by the tyrant, and Ibn Sheyri having consented to become their  “chief, they determined upon ridding themselves of the Amir at all hazards. It  ‘« was on a Friday, about the middle of the month of Shawwél (a. p. 1228). What  “‘ with the fear of Mohammed’s vengeance, should their plans be discovered, and  “the dread caused by the enemy, who was known to be at no great distance from    ",368,book_8,

Presently Mohammed summons  ‘* to his presence the captain of his guards, and commands him to bring before him  ‘fifty of the principal citizens, the most distinguished by their birth, wealth,  “or talents. The tyrant’s orders were immediately complied with, and the fifty  ‘* individuals stood before him : they were all expecting to be marched to immediate  “execution, when, lo! a horseman appears, dressed as a courier, who, being  ‘introduced into the Amir’s presence, informs him that the Christian fleet,  ““composed of upwards of forty sail, is in sight, and making for the shore.  “No sooner, however, had the horseman finished his recital, than a second mes-  “‘senger from a different quarter rushed breathless into the audience chamber,  ‘ saying, ‘ The Christian fleet is in sight, and I can count seventy sail.’ The fact  “* was soon ascertained, and the news found to be true. Mohammed then pardoned  “the fifty citizens who had been sentenced to death, and having apprised them  “* of the arrival of the enemy, bade them go and prepare for the defence of the city.  ‘“* Accordingly they all went home, and were received by their families as if they  ‘‘ had risen from the tomb. Soon after the news arrived that the Christians were  ‘* just at hand, and that their fleet was composed of one hundred and fifty sail.   “ After crossing the bay, the Christians made for the harbour [intending to  “ land] ; but the Amir having sent against them some infantry and cavalry, with  ‘‘ orders to station themselves on the shore and to remain there encamped both  ‘« day and night, they were prevented from landing. At last the Christians gained  their object ; and on the 18th of Shawwél (a. p. 1228), which was a Monday, an  “‘ engagement took place in which the Moslems were completely defeated. After  “this, the enemy marched to the city and encamped on the deserted and unculti-  “vated plain, close to the gate of Al-kahl,!° whence they made several assaults  ‘* upon the city, and were on the point of taking it by storm. When Ibn Sheyri  “saw that the Christians were masters of the neighbouring country, and that  ‘the city could not hold out much longer, he left it secretly and made for the  “interior of the island, with such among the inhabitants as would follow him.  “On Friday, the 11th of Safar, a.u. 628 (Dec. 18, a.p. 1230), the Christians  ‘* made a general attack on the city, and on the following Sunday "" became masters  “ of it; when in the massacre that ensued no less than twenty-four thousand of the  “inhabitants were inhumanly sacrificed for the fault of a single individual. The  “ Amir was taken! and subjected to all manner of torture, under which he  “ expired forty-five days after his capture. As to Ibn Sheyri, he betook himself to  ‘* the mountainous part of the island, in which were many places strongly fortified  “ by nature, and having collected around him a force of sixteen thousand men,",369,book_8,
"    332 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book viII.    “‘ he defended himself bravely for some time, until he was killed on Friday the 10th  ‘* of Rabi’ the second, of the year 628 (Feb. 14, a. p. 1231).   “ This Ibn Sheyri derived his pedigree from the:sons of Jubalah Ibn Al-ahyam  *« Al-ghossani. The remaining fortresses in the island were taken by the Christians  ‘about the end of Rejeb of the same year, 628 (May, a.p. 1231); and by the  “month of Sha’ban all those who succeeded in making their escape reached the  “‘ dominions of Islam.” The above is borrowed from the work of Ibn ’Omayrah  Al-makhzimi.   There were at Mallorca several distinguished theologians and eminent poets.  Among the latter was one named Ibn ’Abdi-l-wali Al-mayurki, who composed  the following verses :   ‘Who can be secure against thy looks, or thy slender waist, bending like  “ the Indian cane ?  “« My blood boils when I see thee; my eyelids hang down and preclude my  “* vision.  “Thy bewitching looks tempt me, and yet I fear not the temptation of  “ Satan.” 38  eee Not far from Mallorca is another island called Menorkah (Minorca), which was  capitulate. governed at the time by the noble, righteous, and learned Sheikh Abi ’Othmén  wih them. Sa’id Ibn Hakem Al-korashi. When the Christians, as above related, took pos-  session of Mallorca and put to death its Amir Abi Yahya, Abi ’Othmdn, who  owed his appointment to the latter, made his peace with the enemy, and agreed to  pay them an annual tribute on condition that no Christian should land on the  island. The treaty was ratified, and Abi ’Othm4n remained master of Minorca,  which he governed with great moderation and wisdom.   Abi-l-hasan ’Alf Ibn Sa’id says, ‘‘I was told by one of the inhabitants of  ‘“‘ Mallorca, who, after the taking of that island by the Christians, took refuge  ‘* in Minorca, that the governor received him very kindly, and tried several times  ‘to persuade him to settle in that out of the way island. He told me that he  “ once rode out with Abi Othman, who, having observed that his sword-belt was  “so tight that it actually left a mark upon his neck, sent him a handsome  “ present in money besides a dress called ghonbdz, with a paper containing the  “ following verses :   ‘The sword-belt always reveals the excellence of its bearer, especially on  ‘days of trepidation and haste.   ‘ The best thing that men can use on such days is a sharp heavy sword  ‘ which makes necessary the wearing of a ghonbdz.’”’'*    ",370,book_8,
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 333    The ghonbdz is among the people of the West a kind of coarse dress, which  covers and protects the neck.   The governor Abi ’Othmdn was originally from a town in the western part,  of Andalus, called Tabirah (Tavira). He was a patron of literature, and many  are the works celebrated for their merits in Western Africa which were dedicated  to him, as the book entitled ‘the soul of the trees and the spirit of the verses,’  and others.    Valencia was another of the cities which fell into the hands of the Christians Siege and    during the above period of civil war and confusion. As early as the year 488 Tencis by the    (a. D. 1095), that city had been taken by the Kanbittir (El Cid Campeador) ; but  the Almoravides had retaken it from them, and it had remained the abode of  Islam until Jakmish (Jayme), King of Aragon, the same who conquered the  island of Mallorca, took it in the year 636, as we are about to relate.   When Abii Ahmed Ibn Jehaf, who was K4di of Valencia, assumed the command  in that city, and proclaimed Yisuf Ibn Téshefin, Al-kddir Ibn Dhi-n-ntn, the  same who had been expelled from Toledo by Alfonso, marched thither at the  head of his forces, and besieged him in it; but Ibn Jeh4f having, with the  assistance of a body of Almoravides, made a sudden attack upon the camp of  Al-k4dir, defeated that Sultén and put him to death.° It appears, however, that  Ibn Jehaf exceeded the limits of his authority; for the same party of the  Almoravides [who had assisted him against Al-kddir] now deserted him and  left him to fight single-handed against his enemies. In this extremity the Kadi  of Valencia sent to implore the assistance of Yusuf, who promised to send troops  to his aid, but the succour never came. Inthe mean while, Yusuf Ibn Ahmed  Ibn Hid, King of Saragossa, who was the enemy of Ibn Jehdf, instigated the  tyrant Rudherik (Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar) to march to Valencia, which he did,  taking possession of that city after a short siege. They relate that Ibn Jehdf  surrendered the city by capitulation, and that Rodrigo asked him to give up [to  him] the treasures of Al-k4dir Ibn Dhi-n-nin; that Ibn Jehdf swore that he knew  nothing of them, and that Rodrigo told him that he would put him to death if  he found them; that he discovered them in his possession, and caused him to  be burned alive. Rodrigo, moreover, plundered Valencia, and almost destroyed it.   The taking of Valencia by the Kanbittir [El Cid Campeador], may the  curse of God fall on his head! happened in the year 488 (a.p. 1095). Some  authors refer it to the year before [a.H. 487]..° But let us hear the account of  Ibnu-l-abbar, who, alluding to that deplorable event, writes as follows: ‘‘ Valencia  ‘was besieged by the Kanbittir for a period of twenty months, after which it  “was taken, some say by capitulation, others by storm. The Christians set fire    Aragonese.",371,book_8,
"    334 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (BOOK VIII.    “to it and destroyed it. Among the Moslems who perished that day in the  ‘ flames was the learned Abi Ja’far Ibnu-l-bana, the celebrated poet (may God  ‘‘ have mercy on him and forgive him his sins!). Some years after the Amir  ‘of the Moslems, Yisuf Ibn Tashefin, sent thither one of his generals, named  * Abt Mohammed Modhzeli,’” who retook it from the enemy in 495 (beginning  “ Oct. 25, a.p. 1101). Valencia was then governed by a succession of Almo-  “‘ravide chieftains till the time of Yahya Ibn Ghaniyyah, who, at the breaking  “ out of the civil war in the sixth century of the Hijra, was expelled from that  “city by Merwdn Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz.'* This latter ruled over Valencia and the  “ neighbouring districts until the year 539 (beginning July 3, a.p. 1144), when  “the army rose against him, deposed him from the command, and appointed in  ‘* his stead Ibn ’Iydédh, King of the Eastern provinces of Andalus. Merwan fled  “ to Almeria.”   After this, Valencia fell into the hands of Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Mardanish, who  succeeded Ibn ‘Iy4dh in the kingdom of Murcia. Abi ’Abdillah appointed a  brother of his, named Abi-l-hej4j Yusuf Ibn Sa’d Ibn Mardanish, to be governor  of the city, and he kept the government of the place until he made his submission  to the Beni ’Abdi-l-mimen.   Under the Almohades, Valencia continued to be ruled, as before, by African  princes, the first of whom was Sid Abi Zeyd ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, son of Sid Abi  *Abdillah Ibn Abi Hafss, and grandson of the Commander of the Faithful, ’Abdu-l-  mtimen Ibn ’Alf. When, as before related, (p. 324), Al-’4dil raised the standard  of revolt at Murcia, fortified himself [in that city], and assumed the supreme  command under pretensions which concealed his ambitious views,’ and when  Abi-l-’ala [Idris] Al-m4miin followed in his steps, a chief named Zeyyén Ibn  Abi-l-hamalét Ibn Abi-l-hejaj Ibn Mardanish, who was one of his most influential  partisans, laid siege to Valencia and took it by storm. Sid Abi Zeyd fled to the  Christians.   The affairs of Valencia grew worse and worse; the enemy went on reducing its  towns and districts, until the King of Barcelona laid siege to it. Zeyyd4n then  implored the aid of Abi Zakariyyé Ibn Abi Hafss, Sultan of Eastern Africa, and  sent as his ambassador the celebrated Katib Abi ’Abdillah Ibnu-l-abbar Al-  kodhé’%,” the author of the Tekmilah (complement), of the A’tdbu-l-kottdb (the  degrees of the scribe), and other works. Ibnu-l-abbér presented himself to that  Sultdn, and recited before him that celebrated kasstdah of his, rhyming in sin, which  has since become so celebrated both in the East and West.   The Sultdn hastened to their assistance; he fitted out his fleet and sent. it to  Valencia with money, provisions, and stores of every description. But when the",372,book_8,
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 335    African fleet appeared [in sight of Valencia] they found that the garrison had been  reduced to the last extremity, and shortly after the enemy of God took possession  of that city by capitulation on Tuesday, the 17th of Safar of 636 (Sept. 29,  A.D. 1238).27 May God Almighty restore it to the Moslems!   Not satisfied with the taking of Valencia, the tyrant Jayme prosecuted his Ferdinand 111.  conquests in those eastern districts, plundering and destroying wherever he went, takes Cordova.  and putting to the sword the unfortunate Moslems. On the other hand, Ferdeland  (Ferdinand III. of Castile) was not inactive. After a siege of several months he  reduced Cordova; and on Sunday, the 23rd of Shawwal of the year 636 (May 29,  A. D. 1239), that seat of the western Khalifate, repository of the theological sciences,  and abode of Islam, passed into the hands of the accursed Christians. (May God  destroy them all!). In the year 645, moreover, the above-mentioned infidel,  Ferdeland, King of Kastellah, besieged the city of Seville by sea and land, and  took it by capitulation on Monday, the 5th of Sha’ban of the ensuing year  (a. a. 646), after a siege of one whole year and five months, or thereabouts. The  historian Ibnu-l-’abbar, in his biographical dictionary entitled Tekmilah (com-  plement), at the article Abi ’Ali Ash-shaliibeyn, says, ‘‘ Ash-shaltibeyn died  ‘ [at Seville], during the siege of that city by the Castilians, on Thursday, the  ‘* 15th of Safar of the year 645 (June 21, a.p. 1247). The year after Seville was  “taken by the enemy.” The same author, Ibnu-l-abbdr, says that the rout of  Aynajah,” in which the Hafedh Abi-r-rabi’ Al-kal4’i was killed, happened on  Thursday, the 20th of Dhi-l-hajjah of the year 634 (August, a. p. 1237), and that  ’Abi-r-rabi’ never ceased fighting in the foremost ranks, striking the infidels with  his sword, encouraging the Moslems, recalling the fugitives, and reminding them  of the pleasures of Paradise, until he himself was slain. Abv-r-rabi’ used to say  that he would live to be seventy, having, when only a boy, had a dream to that  effect; and so it was; for at the time he was killed he had just entered his  seventieth year. The Hafedh Abi ’Abdillah Ibnu-l-abbaér wrote an elegy rhyming  - in mim on the death of Abi-r-rabi’. One of the historians of Andalus says that  Abi-r-rabi’ was the disciple of Abi-l-k4sim Ibn Hobeysh, and of his class or  school. He wrote several works, among which the following are most celebrated :  Misbdhu-dh-dholam ft-l-hadtth (the lamp of darkness: on sacred traditions) ; Al-  arba’tin ’an arba’tn sheykhan liarba’tn min-assdhibah (the forty traditions collected  from forty doctors who held them from forty of the companions of the Prophet) ;  Al-tktifd fl maghdési rastli-llah wa maghdzt-l-thaldthi-l-kholafd (the sufficient: on  the wars of the messenger of God and the three [first] Khalifs) ; Meyddnu-s-sdbikin  wa halbatu-s-sddikin-l-musaddikin ft gharas kitdbi-Listi’db (the hippodrome of the  active and the arena for the sincere who fulfil their religious duties: or a treatise on",373,book_8,

We have related elsewhere (p. 313) how the city of Almeria, after remaining  for a length of time in the hands of the enemy, was recovered by the two  Almohade princes [Abi Sa’id and Abi Hafss] in the year 546 (beginning April 19,  a.p. 1151).% The city, however, had been almost destroyed (during its occupation  by the Christians], and would have been entirely deserted, had not ’Abdu-l-mtiimen  appointed as governor a chief named Abi-l-’abb4s Ahmed Ibn Kemmal, who was a  native of it, and who took pains for its preservation. A sister of this Abi-1-’abbés  was made prisoner at the taking of Bejennah (Pechina) by [the troops of] ’Abdu-I-  miimen, and conveyed to the palace of that Sultan, with whom she rose so much  in favour that she obtained for her brother the government of his native [town].  Abi-l-’abb4s was a man of a generous and benevolent disposition.   Among the governors of Almeria during the rule of the sons of ’Abdu-l-mimen,  in the seventh century of the Hijra, one of the most distinguished was the Amir  Abi ‘Imrdén Ibn Abi Hafss, the uncle of Abi Zakariyy4 [who became afterwards]  ruler of Eastern Africa. But to return.   When, in the year 625 (a. p. 1228), the people of Andalus, as before related  (p. 326), revolted against their Sultén Al-mamun [Idris], of the posterity of  ’Abdu-l-mimen, and Ibn Hiid rose in arms at Murcia, a chief named Abi ’Abdillah  Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Abi Yahya Ibnu-r-remimi, a descendant of that  Ibnu-r-remimi from whom the Christians had taken Almeria® [in a.u. 542],  rose in that city and proclaimed Ibn Hid. This being done, Ibnu-r-remimi  repaired to Murcia, where Ibn Hid was at the time, and acquainted that chief  with what he had done. Ibn Hid received Ibnu-r-remimi kindly, and, as a reward  for the important service he had just performed, appointed him governor of Almeria,  chose him for his Wizir, and intrusted to him the entire management of his  affairs. Things continued in this state for some time until Ibnu-r-remimi dex-  terously persuaded Ibn Hid to have the castle of Almeria repaired and fortified,  in order that it might be made a bulwark [to his kingdom]; but the truth was  that Ibnu-r-remimi ‘intended it as a stronghold for himself. Ibn Hiid acceded  to his request, and the castle of Almeria was accordingly repaired and strongly",374,book_8,
"    CHAP. IV.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 337    fortified. It happened that [in one of his visits to Almeria], Ibn Hid left under  the care of Ibnu-r-remimi a mistress of his on whom he doted; but Ibnu-r-  remimi, who was also passionately fond of her, violated the laws of hospitality,  and seduced her. Intelligence of their criminal intercourse being secretly con-  veyed to Ibn Hid, he hastened to Almeria, intending to take ample revenge on  the governor; but Ibnu-r-remimi was beforehand with him, and had him strangled  whilst in his bed. Ibnu-l-khattib relates the above differently: he says that  “‘Ibn Hid had promised his wife never to marry another as long as she lived.  “When, however, he rose into power, his eyes fell on the daughter of a Christian  “« chief taken in one of his campaigns: she was one of the most beautiful creatures  “that ever lived, and Ibn Hid became so deeply enamoured of her that he  “‘ determined upon living with her, notwithstanding the solemn promise he had  ‘“ made to his wife. In order, however, to conceal his guilt from the latter, he  ‘“‘ gave her in charge to his lieutenant, Ibnu-r-remimi, the governor of Almeria,  “‘ who, they say, conceived likewise a strong attachment for the woman, and  “‘ seduced her. Finding that she was pregnant, and that Ibn Hiid, who was shortly  “expected in Murcia, could not fail to discover the guilt, Ibnu-r-remimi had  ‘recourse to the following stratagem. When he heard that Ibn Hid was close  “to Almeria, he went out to meet him, and invited him to come to his palace.  ‘“‘Tbn Hiid accepted the invitation, and in the dead of night four men stole into  ‘the sleeping apartment of that Sultdén and suffocated him with the pillows of  “his bed. On the morning of the following day, it was announced that Ibn  ‘* Hid had died suddenly during the night; notaries and witnesses were called  “in to certify the fact, and his body was placed in a coffin and sent by sea to  “Murcia. The death of Ibn Hiid took place on the 24th of Jumdda the second, of  “ the year 635 (Dec. 12, a. pv. 1237).”   . After the death of Ibn Hid, Ibnu-r-remimi made himself master of Almeria.  A son of his revolted against him, and after several revolutions and events which  would take us too long to relate, the city fell into the hands of Ibnu-l-ahmar,  King of Granada, whose posterity retained it until the infidels took it from them  when they conquered the whole of Andalus, as we shall hereafter relate. There is  no conqueror but God !   As to the Beni Htid, the last of the family was Al-w4thik, son of Al-  mutawakkel. Being hard pressed {in Murcia] by Alfonso of Barcelona, he sent  to implore the assistance of Ibnu-l-ahmar, offering himself as his vassal. Ibnu-l-  ahmar granted his request, and sent him some troops under the command of Ibn  Ashkililah, who took possession of Murcia in his master’s name, and had him  proclaimed [in the mosques].

Ir now behoves us to speak of the Beni Nasr, a powerful dynasty which reigned Origin of the  for nearly three centuries at Granada, and is well worthy of mention, not only  because Lisdnu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattib was Wizir to one of them, but because they  were the last [Mohammedan] rulers of Andalus, since from one of them the  Christians conquered the whole of that country, as we shall hereafter relate.  The origin of this dynasty is thus given by the historian of Africa, Abii Zeyd  *Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Khaldtin Al-hadhrami. ‘‘ The Beni Nasr were originally  “from Arjinah (Arjona), a castle in the jurisdiction of Cordova. Their ancestors  “had been Officers of rank [in the army], and were well known in that country  “‘ as the Beni Nasr, or the sons of Nasr. They connected their genealogy with  ‘* Sa’d Ibn ’Obddah, Lord of the tribe of Khazrej. The head of the family, towards  “ the close of the dynasty of the Almohades, was Nasr [lege Mohammed]' Ibn Yisuf,  “better known as Ash-sheikh (the Sheikh) ; his brother’s name was Isma’fl: the  “* former especially enjoyed considerable influence among his kindred. When the  ‘fortune of the Almohades began to decline, and rebels rose against them in  ‘* Andalus,—when the Sids? or members of the royal family began to give up  “ their castles and fortresses to the Christian king,— when, in short, Mohammed  “Ibn Yusuf Ibn Hiid rose at Murcia, and, having proclaimed the reigning Khalif  ‘‘ of the house of ’Abbd4s, took possession [in his name] of the eastern provinces  “* of Andalus,—the Sheikh [Ibnu-l-ahmar] prepared also for rebellion, and in the",377,book_8,
"    340 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK viII.    “ year 629 (beginning Oct. 28, a. p. 1231) caused himself to be proclaimed Sultan  ‘ of Andalus, although he ordered that the name of Abi Zakariyyé [Yahya Ibn Abi  ‘« Hafss], Sultén of Eastern Africa, should be mentioned in the public prayers, as  “ Commander of the Faithful. In the following year, a. H. 630 (beginning Oct. 17,  “a.p. 1232), Jaen and Sherish (Xerez) submitted to him. All this Ibnu-l-ahmar  “* accomplished with the assistance of his relatives the Beni Nasr, and of the family  “of Ibn Ashkililah, to whom he was related by marriage.* Subsequently to this,  “in the year 631 (beginning Oct. 6, a.p. 1233), hearing that Ibn Hvd had  ‘‘ received from Baghddd a favourable answer to his petition, Ibnu-l-ahmar sent  “in his allegiance to that Sultan. Then happened the rebellion at Seville of Abi  “« Merwan Al-bdji, who, taking advantage of the departure of Ibn Hud [from that  “‘ city] to return to Murcia, rose and declared himself independent. With this  “‘ chieftain Ibnu-l-ahmar entered into a treaty of alliance, giving him one of his  “ daughters in marriage, and promising to defend him against Ibn Hud on condition  “ that he would acknowledge himself his vassal. Al-baji accepted the proposition,  “and Ibnu-l-ahmar accordingly entered Seville as its lord in 632 (beginning Sept. 25,  ““a.p. 1234); but in the course of time he had Al-baji seized and put to death,  ‘ through the means of Ibn Ashkiltilah, whom he sent thither for that purpose.   “One month after the above event, the people of Seville returned to the alle-  ** giance of Ibn Hid, and expelled [the troops of] Ibnu-l-ahmar; but in 635  “ (beginning Aug. 23, a. p. 1237), the latter prince made himself master of Granada  “by means of his secret partisans there. An influential citizen of that place,  “named Ibn Abi Khaled, who was his friend, having risen against Ibn Hid,  ‘ prevailed upon the citizens to proclaim Ibnu-l-ahmar, and, hastening to Jaen,  ‘‘ where that Sultén was at the time, tendered to him the allegiance of the  .“‘ inhabitants. Immediately upon the receipt of this news, Ibnu-l-ahmar dispatched  “ Tbn Ashkililah to Granada with a portion of his forces ; he himself followed with  ‘‘ the rest of his army, and having taken up his abode in that city, built the fortress  “* of the Al-hamra (Alhambra), as a residence for himself. Soon after the acquisition  “‘ of Granada, Ibnu-l-ahmar obtained possession of Malaga, and in the year 643  “* (beginning May 28, a.p. 1245) received Almeria from the hands of Ibnu-r-  “ remimi, the Wizir of Ibn Hid, who had risen and taken the command of the  ‘place. Ibnu-l-ahmar was next proclaimed by the people of Lorca, who, in 663  “« (beginning Oct. 23, a.p. 1264), sent their allegiance to Granada.   ‘* During the events above related the Christians reduced several important cities  “of Andalus, chiefly through the division and perversity of their Mohammedan  ‘rulers. At the commencement of his reign, Ibnu-l-ahmar had entered into an  “alliance with the Christian king [Ferdinand III. of Castile], for the purpose of",378,book_8,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 341    ‘* obtaining his aid [against Ibn Hid] ; and the infidel king had accordingly sent  ‘him occasional succours of troops. Ibn Htid, on the other hand, wishing to  “‘ detach the Christian from the cause of Ibnu-l-ahmar, had offered him thirty  ** castles on the western frontier of his dominions, if he would forsake that Sultan  ‘and assist him to take possession of Cordova: the offer was accepted, and the  “* castles delivered to the Christians. At last, in the year 633 (beginning Sept. 15,  ‘* a. p. 1236), the enemy took possession of Cordova (may God restore it to Islim !),  “and, in the year 646 (beginning April 25, a. p. 1248), laid siege to Seville,  “ Tbnu-l-ahmar himself co-operating with his forces [against the Moslems]. After  ‘‘a vigorous and long protracted defence, the city was taken by capitulation, and  “the Christians became masters of its districts. Murcia also fell into their hands  ‘in 665 (beginning Oct. 1, a.p. 1266) ; in short, the Christian king [Ferdinand III.  ‘* of Castile] ceased not to assail the dominions of Islam, and to take district after  “« district and castle after castle until the whole of the Moslem population were  “« driven to the coast between Ronda in the west and [Almeria in] the eastern parts  ‘of Andalus, about twenty marhala® in length and one marhala or less in width  “ from the sea to the furthermost point on the northern frontier.   “‘ Subsequently to this, Ibnu-l-ahmar grew angry, and sought to obtain possession  “ of the rest of the island; but he found the task too difficult, and was unable  ‘* to accomplish his purpose. Troops, however, sent by the Beni Merin and other  ‘* African dynasties, occasionally crossed over to his assistance, and with them  “ Tonu-l-ahmar was enabled to keep the Christians at bay. For instance, in the  “‘ year 660 (beginning Nov. 25, a.p. 1261), according to previous stipulation, the  “ Sultan of Western Africa, Ya’kib Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakk, sent him three thousand  “‘ warriors, whose arrival Ibnu-l-ahmar welcomed, and with whom he repelled the  “attacks of the enemy, and inflicted serious losses upon them. On the return  “of these auxiliary troops to Africa, others kept continually going over in their  “ stead, until the death of the Sheikh Ibnu-l-ahmar, which happened in 671  “ (a. D. 1272).”   So far Ibnu Khaldin, who, as is well known, resided some time at Granada,®  and must have been in possession of authentic records respecting the founder of  the dynasty of the Beni Nasr ; but as we are also able to quote from Ibnu-l-khattib,  whose works’ abound with precious information respecting the establishment of that  dynasty and the high deeds of its members, we will in future quote from him.   “Mohammed Ibn Ytisuf Ibn Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibn Khamiss Ibn Nasr peau  “Tbn Kays Al-khazreji Al-ansdri was descended from Sa’d Ibn ’Obddah, the Inn-t-ahmar.  “* companion of the Prophet.

His kunyd was Abd ’Abdillah, and he was  “also surnamed Ibnu-l-ahmar and Al-ghdlib-billah (the conqueror by the grace  ‘© of God). Both historians and genealogists have all acknowledged the illustrious  “ origin of this family, which, as above stated, was descended in a direct line from  ‘* Sa’d Ibn ’Obd4dah, Lord of the tribe of Khazrej, and one of the companions of  “our holy Prophet. Ar-rézi, among others, in his genealogical treatise asserts  ‘that two men of the posterity of that illustrious individual entered Andalus at  ‘ the time of the conquest; one settled at Tékeriina,* the other at a village close  “‘ to Saragossa, which, from the name of his tribe, was called Kariat Khazrej.  “Mohammed was born in 591 (a.p. 1195) at Arjinah (Arjona), in the territory  ‘© of Cordova, where he inherited from his father extensive estates, which he  “ cultivated himself. I was told by the Katib Mohammed Ibn Mohammed Ibn  ‘© *Abdillah Al-lishi (from Loxa) Al-yahssobi,? whom I once met in Jaen, that  ‘his grandfather had a mare of the best quahties, which he used to mount  ‘‘ whenever he had to repel an attack of the enemy, or to make an incursion  ‘into his territory. In this manner the animal became known among the  “ Christians of the neighbouring districts for its excellent qualities and its aptitude  “for border warfare, until the King of the Christians, happening to hear of it,  “sent a message to Al-ltshi, requesting him to sell him the mare and fix his  “‘own price. Al-hishi, however, was so much attached to the animal that he  “could not bear to part with her at any price, and he accordingly refused to  ‘« sell her to the king. They say that on the night of the day on which he  “ received the message from the infidel king, Al-ltishi dreamt a dream, and  “heard a voice saying to him, ‘Go to Arjona and take thy good mare with  “ thee; when there, thou shalt inquire for a man named Mohammed Ibn Yisuf,  “ and when thou hast found him, thou shalt sell thy mare to him, for he shall  “ certainly ride on it, and be the conqueror of Jaen and other towns, by which  “ conquests thy posterity shall be benefited.’ Al-lishi at first paid no attention  “to this warning; but having heard the same voice a second, and even a third  “ time in his dreams, he at last began seriously to think about it. Having inquired  “from a friend of his named Ibn Ya’ysh, who was well acquainted with the sur-  “ rounding country and its inhabitants, who the person could be who was described  “to him in his dream, Ibn Ya’ysh told him that it could be no other than Ibnu-l- _  “ahmar. Al-hishi, therefore, proceeded to Arjona and took up his abode in the  “town. No sooner was his arrival made known, as well as the object of his  ** journey, than Ibnu-l-ahmar and some of his relatives went to Al-hishi’s lodgings",380,book_8,
"    CHAP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 343    ‘“‘ and began to bargain for the mare; but the price which he asked was so  “ exorbitant that Ibnu-l-ahmar declared his inability to pay the sum demanded.  “ At last Ibnu-l-ahmar, having offered to pay a portion of the money down and  “the rest by instalments, Al-lishi accepted the offer, and Ibnu-l-ahmar took  “the mare home. The bargain being concluded, Al-lishi took Ibnu-l-ahmar  “‘to the mosque of the castle, and there disclosed to him the dream which he  “had dreamt. Ibnu-l-ahmar paid him the sum agreed between the two, and  ‘ Al-hishi returned to Jaen.   “« Scarcely had a year elapsed after this occurrence, when Ibnu-l-ahmar assumed [it revolt *  “‘ the royal title at his native town, and soon after took possession of the wealthy  “city of Jaen. Historians, however, are at variance as to the cause which impelled  ‘him to do so, some saying that it was some injustice done him by one of the  ‘* governors of the district which prompted him to revolt.   “¢ After Jaen, Ibnu-l-ahmar took Granada. He also made himself master of  “ Seville in the last days of Rabi’ the first, of the very year in which he rose,  “ that is, in 629,'° and remained in possession of that city for nearly thirty days.  “He also took Cordova on the 11th day of Rejeb of the aforesaid year: both  ‘ those cities, however, returned to the possession of Ibn Hid.   “ Tbnu-l-ahmar was frequently at war with Al-mutawakkel [Ibn Hid], who, His mare with  ‘as above stated (p. 336), was Sultén of Murcia, Almeria, and the greater part  * of Eastern Andalus, and who at one time made himself master of almost the  “whole country. He once defeated him most completely in the neighbourhood  “of Seville, whither Ibn Hid had gone for the purpose of chastising the revolt  “of Al-bdji. Having joined his forces to those of that rebel, Ibnu-l-ahmar  “attacked the camp of his adversary and routed his army, obliging Ibn Hid  “to embark for Murcia. This happened in 629. Five years after (a. u. 634),  “ Tbn Hiid was again defeated with great loss by Ibnu-l-ahmar, in the district  *¢ of Elvira, near Granada.   ‘* At the beginning of his reign, Ibnu-l-ahmar showed every attention and respect  ‘“‘ towards the kings of the opposite coast [Western Africa], as well as towards  “ those of Eastern Africa, and he went so far as to have the khotbah said for the  “ Jatter in all the mosques of his dominions, hoping thereby to obtain their help  ‘ and assistance [against the Christians]. He also said the khotbah for the Sultan  ‘“‘ of Baghdad, Al-mustanser Al-’abbdsi; but in the end he would acknowledge  “no sovereign but himself.   “ Tbnu-l-ahmar was at Jaen when the people of Granada proclaimed him at the Takes pos.  “ instigation of Ibn [Abi] Khaled, and he entered that city in the last days of Ra- #2.  “* madhdn of the year 635 (May, a.p. 1238).

Abti Mohammed Al-basti (from Baza), who saw Ibnu-l-ahmar  ‘ ride through the city, says that he was dressed in a tunic’? of the stuff called  ‘* milaf, striped, the sleeves of which were open at the sides. Just as Ibnu-l-ahmar  “ arrived at the gate of the kassdbah, the voice of the muezzin was heard in the  “* distance, calling the people to the prayer of the setting sun ; upon which, without  “ going any further, Ibnu-l-ahmar went into the mihrdb of the mosque, and recited  “ the first chapter of the Koran, and went into the castle of Badis, preceded by men  ‘ bearing wax-tapers.”   Ibnu-l-khattib goes on to relate how Ibnu-l-ahmar assisted the Christian king  (Ferdinand III. of Castile) in the reduction of Seville, Carmona, and other towns of  Andalus, after which he continues,—   “In the year 643 a peace was concluded between Ibnu-l-ahmar and the King of  “ the Christians, and a treaty signed, one of the conditions of which was that Jaen  ‘should be given up to the Christians. Some time before Ibnu-l-ahmar had  ““ completely defeated the infidels near a castle called Bolullos,'* at one day’s march  “ from his capital. Ibnu-l-ahmar, however, repented of what he had done, and in  “ the year 662, after causing his son Mohammed to be sworn as his legitimate heir,  ‘‘ he summoned the [African] tribes to aid him in the holy war. Having made  ‘* every necessary preparation, he invaded the Christian territory.”   As long as he lived, Ibnu-l-ahmar was on terms of amity and friendly corres-  pondence with the rulers of Western Africa, the Beni Merin, who had built their  empire on the ruins of that of the Almohades. One of the most powerful monarchs  of that dynasty was Ya’kib Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakk, who, having received an embassy  from the people of Andalus, imploring his powerful assistance against the Christians,  crossed over to that country and gained a most signal victory over the infidels, as  we shall hereafter relate. Ya’ktb was succeeded by his son Yusuf, to whose court  Alfonso,""* King of the Christians, came for the purpose of obtaining his aid to  regain possession of his kingdom. After Yusuf reigned Abi Thabit, and after  the latter Abi Rabi’ Suleyman, who was succeeded by Abii Sa’id ’Indn; but as  it is not our object in this place to write the history of that dynasty, we will resume  the thread of our interrupted narrative.   ‘* Tbnu-l-ahmar died on the 1 5th of Jumada 11. of the year 671 (Sept. 10, a.p. 1272).  ‘* His death happened in this way. Having heard that some Christian chieftains  ‘* had with their united forces made a foray close to his capital, he sallied out to  “meet them. As he was returning to his palace, he stumbled and fell down; he  ‘“* was immediately put on a horse and conveyed to his palace, supported by one of",382,book_8,

Shortly after, on Friday, the 29th of Jumada  “‘ the second, after the prayer of ’asr (before sunset), Ibnu-l-ahmar died, and was  ‘‘ immediately buried in the makborah (cemetery) of the old mosque, on the hill  “of Sibkah.'® He was born at Arjona in the year 591 (beginning Dec. 13,  ** a.p. 1194), known in Andalus as ‘the year of Alarcos,’ because the celebrated  ‘* battle of that name was fought in it. His proclamation took place on a Friday  “ of the year 626. He was the father of three sons; Mohammed, who succeeded  “ him in the empire, Farej, and Ytisuf, who died before him.”   On the death of Ibnu-l-ahmar, his son Mohammed, surnamed Abi ’Abdillah, 0 Hear   succeeded him. He was then thirty-eight years old, having been born at Granada hammed II.  in the year 633. No sooner had he ascended his father’s throne, than he began  to give his most serious consideration to the enlargement of his dominions at the  expense of the infidels. Ibnu Khaldin relates, that when Mohammed Ibnu-l- His campaigns  ahmar saw his death approach he sent for his son and gave him his last in- Christians,  structions, among which one was that in his wars with the Christians he was  always to implore the assistance of the Beni Merin, who had inherited the  empire of the Almohades in Western Africa. Accordingly, when in the year  672 (beginning July 17, a.p. 1273) Mohammed Al-fakih'® (or, the theologian,  as the King of Granada is called by that historian,) heard that the Christians  were about to carry the war into his dominions, he sent over an embassy to  Ya’kib Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakk, Sultan of Fez and Western Africa, soliciting his aid  against the infidels; and that sovereign, having graciously acceded to his request,  sent first his own son at the head of an army, and himself followed shortly after.  Having taken Jeziratu-l-khadhra (Algesiras) from the hands of a rebel who had  gained possession of it, he converted it into a receptacle for his warriors. Mo-  hammed, moreover, gave up to the African sovereign Tarifa and the castles  appertaining to it; and when every thing had been arranged, the two kings  united, put to flight Don Nujio, the general of the Christians, dispersed his army,  and routed every where the troops of the Castilian king, sending large bodies  of cavalry to make predatory incursions into his dominions. At last, through  fear of the Africans, Mohammed made his peace with the Christians, and Ya’kib  returned to Africa. In the course of time, however, the kings of Granada recovered  Algesiras, Tarifa, Ronda, and all the fortresses which this Mohammed had given  up to the Beni Merin. So far Ibnu Khaldiin, whose narrative we have somewhat  abridged.   The victory above alluded to was gained by the united forces of Mohammed and Destbjot(Dion  Abi Ya’kib Yusuf on the 15th day of Rabi’ the first, of the year 674 (Sept. 8, Nufo de Tara  A.D. 1275), Don-Niinoh (Nufio Gonzalez de Lara), the general of the Christians,   VOL.

Shortly after, God  was again pleased to send down victory to the Moslem banners, and to spread  woe and confusion through the ranks of the infidels; for Sancho <Al-mitrdn  (Archbishop of Toledo), having made an incursion into the Moslem territory, the  troops of Granada overtook him near the town of Martosh (Martos), and com-  pletely defeated his army, he himself remaining among the dead.   In the month of Moharram of the year 695 (Nov., a. p. 1295), shortly after the  death of Sancho, son of Alfonso, the Castilians prepared to invade the territory  of Granada; but Mohammed, having received intelligence of their movements,  marched against them, and, having laid siege to Kijéttah (Quesada), reduced that  important city, besides several small towns and fortresses which depended on it.  Having left a sufficient garrison for the defence of the place, Mohammed returned  to Granada. In the year 699 (beginning Sept. 27, a. p. 1299) he besieged the town  of Al-kabdhak, and, after a few vigorous attacks, made himself master of it. The  Christian garrison then took refuge in the kassdbah, a place well known in the  surrounding country for its strength ; but the Moslems took it by storm shortly  after the hour of noon, on Sunday, the 8th of Shawwal (June 27, a. p. 1300), and  put the garrison to the sword. After repairing the fortifications, in which he  himself worked, helping to dig the moat with his own hands, Mohammed converted  the place into a rdbittah or border fortress, and, leaving a body of chosen warriors  to defend it, returned to his capital.   After a prosperous reign of thirty years and one month, Mohammed died suddenly  at Granada on Sunday, the 8th day of Sha’ban of the year 701 (April 9, a. p. 1302).  There are not wanting historians who assert that he was poisoned by his son and  successor. He was interred apart from his ancestors, to the east of the great  mosque, in the gardens adjoining his palace. In aftertime his grandson Abi-l-  walid, and Abi-l-hejaj, son of the latter, were interred by his side. He had three  sons ; his successor, Abii ’Abdillah, Faraj, who died in the lifetime of his father, and  Nasr, who succeeded Abi ’Abdillah on the throne.   Mohammed, surnamed Abt ’Abdillah, succeeded. He was one of the greatest  monarchs of the Nasserite dynasty. Having been educated under the eye of his  father, and trained from early youth in the duties of government, he displayed  immediately upon his accession that sagacity and tact by which the monarchs of  his family, surrounded as they were by enemies, were particularly distinguished.   Soon after his accession to the throne he made an incursion into the enemy’s  territory. The result was the taking of the town of Al-mandhar,"" which he entered  by force of arms, and the captivity of all the garrison. Among the prisoners was  the lady of the place, a woman of matchless beauty, the brightest gem among",384,book_8,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 347    the Christians. She was marched into the capital with the rest of the prisoners,  splendidly mounted and attired, and shining with beauty. She became afterwards  the wife of the Sultan of Western Africa.   In the year 703 (beginning Aug. 14, 1303), the Sultan being displeased with  his relative the Reys Abv-l-hejaj Ibn Nasr, governor of Guadix, for some act of  his administration there, removed him from his government. Abi-l-hejaj, who  was then residing at court, began secretly to form a party in his favour both at  the capital and at Guadix, which being reported to Mohammed, he caused him  to be arrested and brought to his presence, when he was immediately executed.  By his death civil war was prevented. In the month of Dhi-l-ka’dah of the same  year [a.H. 703], after the death of his Wizir, Abi-s-sultan ’Aziz Ibn ’Ala Ibn  *Abdi-l-mun’am, of Denia, Mohammed named to that office one of his own  secretaries, named Abi ’Abdillah Ibnu-l-hakim, in whom he placed all his con-  fidence. The Wizir, who was a shrewd and ambitious man, failed not to take  advantage of his position, and to gain over the mind of his sovereign, whereby  he effected his own ruin, as we shall presently relate.   In Shawwal of the year 705 (April or May, a. p. 1306) Mohammed took Ceuta  from Abi Talib ’Abdullah Ibnu-l-k4sim, son of the Reys and Faquih, Im4m and  traditionist, ’Abu-]-’abbds Al-’izafi.® By this victory Mohammed became the  master of immense wealth belonging to the merchants of that port, besides countless  treasures amassed by that chieftain. The chief inhabitants of that place were also  led prisoners to Granada, where, at the beginning of Moharram of the ensuing year  (a. H. 706), they received orders to appear in the presence of the Sultén. Mo-  hammed received them in state, surrounded by his ministers and his guards. Some  of the prisoners, however, having recited verses in praise of him, his heart was  touched, and he set them all at liberty, assigning to each of them a house to reside  in and a suitable pension for his sustenance.   This excellent monarch could not escape the shafts of treason. A considerable Misleotber  party having been formed in his own capital in favour of his brother Nasr, he was against him.  compelled to abdicate on the day of Al-fitr of the year 708 (April, a.p. 1309). Ac-  cording to Ibnu-l-khattib the event happened thus. ‘“‘ Early in the morning of  “that day a party of the principal citizens went to the dwelling of his brother :  “‘ thence they repaired to the house of the Wizir Abd ’Abdillah Ibnu-l-hakim,  “who, however, received timely intelligence of their arrival and escaped. Thence,  “ after proclaiming, as they went along, the prince Abd-l-jiytish Nasr, they took the  “* direction of the royal palace, which they surrounded on all sides. In the mean  “ while the house of the Wizir Abii ’Abdillah 9 was attacked by the mob, and gutted  ‘* of all its valuable contents, besides the treasures which he had amassed in books,",385,book_8,

Towards the end of  “the day, a party of the revolted went up to the Sult4n, and, having removed  ‘‘ him from his palace to another house, compelled him to abdicate in favour  “of his brother. Mohammed consented, witnesses were called in, and a deed  “‘ prepared which he signed. After this he retired to a pleasure-house outside  “ the capital, called the palace of Seyd, whence, after a short stay, he proceeded  “to Almuiecar.”   No sooner was Nasr raised to the throne than he had to defend his dominions  against enemies at home and abroad. The first act of his administration was to  appoint to the charge of Wizir, ’Attik Ibn Mohammed Ibn Al-mil, and after him,  Mohammed Ibn ’Ala Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Al-hdj,?? by whose intrigues he was after-  wards deprived of his throne.   In the year 709 (beginning June 10, a. pv. 1309), the King of Castile, Herando  (Fernando IV.), laid siege to Algesiras. He remained before that city from the  2st day of Safar till the end of Sha’ban, when, despairing of reducing the place,  he raised the siege, though not without making himself master of Gibraltar. In  the mean while, the Lord of Barcelona, another Christian king, arrived before  Almeria in the first days of Rabi’ the first, of the aforesaid year (August,  A.D. 1309). He laid siege to the city, which he closely invested, after completely  defeating an army sent for its relief. In this manner he remaiped encamped  before the city, daily pressing the siege more and more, until, towards the end  of Sha’ban, God Almighty was pleased to permit that the infidel should retire from  before its walls.   Scarcely was Nasr delivered from his enemies, the Christians, when all his  attention was engrossed by the revolt of one of his relatives, named Abii Sa’id  Faraj, who was governor of Malaga and its district, as well as of Ceuta, which,  as above related, the dethroned Sultan took in 705. Abt Sa’id was the son of  Isma’il, the brother of Mohammed Ibnu-l-ahmar, the founder of the Nasserite  dynasty. Having repaired to Granada for the purpose of tendering the oath of  allegiance to Nasr, he was there persuaded by some of the chiefs and high  functionaries at court to rise against the usurper. Accordingly, on his return to  Malaga, Abt Sa’id raised the standard of revolt, and caused his own son Abi-l-  walid Isma’il to be proclaimed. This happened on the 17th day of Ramadhan of  the year 709 (Feb. 18, a. p. 1310). Some months after, Abti-l-walid marched to  Antikeyrah (Antequera), of which he made himself master: the city of Almeria  also submitted to him; not so Belesh (Velez), the inhabitants of which shut their  gates and refused to admit him into their town; but Abi-l-walid, having sent for  some besieging engines, destroyed part of their walls and forced them to surrender. _",386,book_8,
"    CHAP. V.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 349    Towards the end of Jumdada the second, of the year 710 (Nov. a. p. 1310), Nasr was  suddenly struck by a fit of apoplexy: so severe was the attack that the physicians  thought he was dead. No sooner was the news spread through Granada, than  the partisans of the dethroned monarch hastened to Almufecar, and besought  him to assert his right to the throne. He, accordingly, set out for that city, borne  in a litter, and entered Granada in the beginning of Rejeb of the same year (Nov.  A.D. 1310). What was his astonishment, and that of his friends, to hear on their  arrival that Nasr had recovered from his illness! By his brother’s order, Mo-  hammed was removed from the house where he alighted to the palace of his eldest  brother Faraj, and in the first days of Shawwél of the same year (Feb. a.p. 1311)  it was rumoured that he was dead. There are not wanting those who assert that  he was privately put to death, and that his body was thrown into a fish-pond in  the garden of the palace. He was buried in the cemetery of As-sabikah,” by the  side of his grandfather Al-ghalib-billah. He was born at Granada on Wednesday,  the 3rd of Sha’ban, 655 (Aug. 16, a. p. 1257). He died on Monday, the 3rd of  Shawwal, a. x. 713 (Jan. 26, a.p. 1314).   Whilst these events were happening, the rebel Abi Sa’id and his son Abi-l-walid  were strengthening themselves in their position, and collecting forces with which to  march against Granada. At length, on the Ist day of Moharram of the year 712  (May 8, a.p. 1312), Abi-lwalid, having put himself at the head of his troops,  advanced against Granada and encamped at a hamlet called Karyatu-l-’otash4,”  at a short distance from that capital. Nasr went out to meet him, and on the Re  13th of the same month (May 18, a. p. 1312) a battle was fought, in which the  former was defeated. Whilst fleeing the field of battle, Nasr was thrown off his  horse into a pond for the use of cattle; he was, however, extricated with great  difficulty by his own men, and reached Granada in safety. Abi-l-walid returned  triumphant to Malaga, where, soon after, in the month of Rabi’ the first, he  received from Nasr propositions of peace, which he accepted. Things were in this  state when, in the month of Ramadhan of the year. 713 (Dec. 27, a.p. 1213),  a revolution broke out at Granada. The inhabitants of that city, being displeased  with the administration of Nasr’s Wizir, Abi ’Abdillah Ibnu-l-h4j, surrounded the  palace of that Sultan, and vociferously demanded that the person of the obnoxious  functionary should be given up to them. A sally made by the Sultén’s guard  soon dispersed the mob, and the chiefs of the insurrection fled for refuge to Malaga,  where they persuaded Abt-l-walid to assume the supreme command and march  against the usurper. Abv-l-walid did as they advised him, and, having marched to  Lishah (Loxa), reduced that city in Shawwél, 713 (January, a.p. 1314). From  Loxa Abi-l-walid returned to Malaga to provide himself with fresh stores, and",387,book_8,

He  then marched to Arshidtinah (Archidona), where he was met by the Sultdn’s army,  under the command of ’Abdu-l-hakk Ibn Othman. A battle ensued in which  victory was long uncertain: at last the troops of Granada gave way and fled in the  utmost confusion, being pursued by the victors to the very gates of the capital.  The inhabitants of the Albayzin, one of the suburbs of Granada, having opened  the gate of Elvira to Abi-l-walid, he penetrated into the city, and, having surprised  the old kassdbah, made himself master of it, and took up his abode in the house  which had once belonged to Ibnu-l-mil, the Wizir. Nasr fled to the Al-hamra  (Alhambra) with his women and treasures; but shortly after he was \compelled  to surrender and submit to the same conditions which he had imposed upon his  brother Mohammed. He left Granada on the 2Ist of Shawwél, 713 (Feb. 8,  A.D. 1314), and retired to Guadix.   The reign of Abd-l-walid Isma’il Ibn Faraj was one of the most prosperous that  the Moslems of Granada ever had. It is true that in the year 716 (beginning  March 25, a.p. 1316) his army was defeated by the Castilians, who reduced  Matamenos, Hisn-Bejij (Bexixar), Hisn-Tishkar (Tiscar), and Thoghir Ritt (the  fortified lines of Rute); but three years after, in 719, the Moslems took ample  revenge for those losses, and destroyed an army commanded by one of their princes,  who himself perished in the action.   In the year. 719 (Feb. 20, a.p. 1319), the Christian kings collected their forces  against Granada, and the tyrant Don Betroh* (Pedro, Infante of Castile,] appeared  before that city with innumerable forces, bringing with him no less than twenty-five  Christian princes. The cause of the war was as follows: the Sultan Abi-l-walid  Isma’il having repaired to the frontiers [of his kingdom] for the purpose of pro-  viding for their defence, and passing in review the troops stationed there, the  Christians resolved upon attacking Algesiras. On the other hand, Abi-l-walid  having heard of their intentions, made every preparation to repel the invasion,  collected troops, fitted out a fleet, and put his kingdom in a state of defence.  The Christians, seeing the Moslems prepared to receive them, assembled at Toledo,  and came to the determination of wresting the whole country from the hands of the  Moslems.   To that end they made every warlike preparation, and collected immense stores,  as well as war engines and besieging machines, which came to them by water from  distant parts, and, when every thing was ready, they marched to Granada. Some  writers add that the king, Don Betroh, repaired to Toledo, where he had a con-  ference with the head of the church,* whom the Christians call Bdébdé (Pope) ;  that he worshipped him, went on his knees before him, and communicated to",388,book_8,

The  Moslems of Granada and other cities had no sooner heard of the immense pre-  parations made by the Christians than they began to tremble with fear, and  decided upon imploring the help of Abi Sa’id Al-merini, Sultén of Fez. They  accordingly sent an embassy to that sovereign, but it produced no effect, and the  Moslems had no other resource left than to put their trust in God (may his name  be exalted!). However, soon after the Franks arrived in sight of Granada, with  forces so numerous that the earth was literally covered with them; but the  victorious God, he who knows no partner in his victories, decreed that the  Christian multitude should be routed, and their king, Don Pedro, slain, with all  his suite. The affair happened thus: the Sultan Abi-l-walid sent forward [against  the Christians] the Sheykhu-l-ghozdt* Abt Sa’id ’Othmén Ibn Abi-l-’ala Al-  merini, with a chosen division of the bravest and best trained troops. Abt Sa’id  left Granada on Thursday, the 20th of Rabi’ the first (May 12, a.p. 1319). On  Saturday evening a body of Christian cavalry came suddenly down upon some  villages, upon which Abi Sa’id sent against them a body of mounted archers, who  surrounded them and cut them off from the main body of their army. Some  of them fled towards the camp of their king, and the Moslems pursued them  all night till the morning of the next day, slaying all those who fell into their  hands, so that but few escaped alive. This was the first victory. On Sunday,  the Sheikh Abi Sa’id marched to meet the enemy with five thousand Moslem  warriors, all men of tried courage and experience. The Christians, seeing them in  such small number, wondered how a handful of men dared attack so considerable  an army as theirs was; yet the Moslems made so desperate an attack that the  Christians gave way immediately, and began to fly in every direction; the Moslems  pursuing them sword in hand for three days, and dealing death among them. Desth of Dou  They say that the number of infidels slain on this occasion amounted to upwards  of fifty thousand, besides as many more who perished in the river, owing to their  not being well acquainted with the fords. As to those who died in the mountains  and ravines of that district, their number was beyond computation. The whole of  the twenty-five princes who had accompanied Don Pedro, as well as himself, fell in  the action.* The battle over, the people of Granada went out to collect the spoils  of the enemy and to bring back the prisoners. The spoils were immense, con-  sisting of forty-three hundred weight of gold, and one hundred and forty hundred  weight of silver, besides weapons, armour, horses, &c. The number of prisoners  amounted to seven thousand,—it is so stated in a letter which a citizen of Granada",389,book_8,

The news, moreover, of  this splendid victory was sent to the most remote parts [inhabited by Moslems].  Among the prisoners were the wife and children of the king, and although she  offered for her ransom the city of Tarifa and the fortress of Jebalu-l-fatah (Gibraltar)  and eighteen more castles of that district, the Moslems would not accept of it,  and she remained in captivity. As to the Christian king, Don Pedro, he was slain  during the action, and his skin, being stripped from his body, was stuffed with  cotton, and suspended over the gate of Granada, where it remained for years. A  very extraordinary circumstance connected with this battle is that only thirteen  horsemen, others say ten, were slain on the side of the Moslems, whose whole force  consisted only of fifteen hundred horse and four thousand foot, or even less ; whereas  the loss of the Christians, who were as numerous as the sands of the desert, was  truly enormous. Ibnu-l-khattib places this memorable battle on the 6th of Jumdda  the first, 719 (June 26, a. p. 1319).”7 He says that the body of Don Pedro was put  in a wooden coffin and suspended from the walls close to the gate of Ya’kub, to  the left-hand side as one comes down from the Alhambra.   After this defeat the Christians sued for peace, which was granted to them;  but at the expiration of the truce, Isma’{l took the field in person and besieged the  fortress of Ashkar, close to Baeza. As its defences were strong and the walls very  thick, he attacked it with his largest engines loaded with naphtha, by means of  which he threw into the place large iron balls.** One of these fell on the top  of one of the towers and destroyed it completely, upon which the garrison were  so terrified that they surrendered to him on the 24th of Rejeb, 724 (July 17,  a. D. 1324). .   On the 10th of Rejeb, 725 (June 22, a.p. 1325), Isma’il marched to Martosh  (Martos), which he invested and took after a short siege. Shortly after his return  from that expedition Isma’il was assassinated by a cousin of his named Mohammed,  who was the son of Isma’il, better known by the surname of Sdhibu-l-jeztrah (the  governor of Algesiras). Mohammed had been present at the siege of Martos:  having whilst there been guilty of some misdemeanour, he was summoned before  his sovereign, who, in the presence of the assembled courtiers, reproved him for  his conduct and spoke very severely to him. Mohammed resented the insult,  and swore to revenge it. On his return to Granada he watched his opportunity,  and, with the aid of his relatives and servants, attacked and murdered Isma’il  as he was going from his palace to a mejless or temporary throne which had been",390,book_8,

This happened  on Tuesday, the 27th of Rejeb, 725, three days after his return from Martos  (July 18, a. p. 1325). Isma’il left four sons: Mohammed, who succeeded him on  the throne; Faraj, who died a prisoner in the citadel of Almeria in 751 ; Abd-l-  hej4j Yusuf, who was also Sultan ; and, lastly, Isma’il.

Soon after his  accession he marched in person against the Christians, and took from them the  city of Kabrah (Cabra). He also besieged Kasharah (Casares ?), and would have  taken it, had not the Castilians thrown succours into the place.   In the days of this Sultén the fortress of Jebal-Tdérik (the mountain of Térik),  or, as it is otherwise called, Jebal-Al-fath (mountain of the entrance or victory),  was wrested from the Christians, after having been in their possession upwards of  twenty years.   We have stated elsewhere (p. 345) that, owing to the intimate alliance existing  between the Kings of Granada and the Sultans of the race of ’Abdu-l-hakk or Beni  Merin, as well as to the frequent expeditions which the latter sent to Andalus  for the purpose of assisting their Moslem brethren in their contest against the  infidels, Gibraltar, Algesiras, Tarifa, and other ports of that coast, had been intrusted  to their keeping by one of the Sultans of Granada. In the year 708, however,  the Castilians, profiting by the absence of a portion of the African garrison, which  had been summoned to Africa, invested Gibraltar and made themselves masters  of it without much difficulty. When the news of this disaster reached Africa,  Abi-l-hasan [’Ali Ibn Othman] Al-merini, Sultan of Fez, who knew the importance",392,book_8,

Accord-  ingly, taking with him one of his sons,’ Abt-l-hasan sailed thither with his fleet,  and, being soon after his landing joined by the troops of Granada under the com-  mand of Mohammed himself, he closely invested the place, and made himself  master of it.   No sooner had Abi-l-hasan reduced Gibraltar under his sway than he began to its fortifica-   give his attention to repairing its buildings and increasing its fortifications, spending beau  immense sums of money in building houses and magazines, as well as a jémi’ or ™**""  principal mosque, and erecting new walls, towers, and even a citadel.? Before, how-  ever, these improvements were fully completed, the Christians invested Gibraltar by  sea and land ; but their attempt was frustrated by the gallant defence of the Moslems,  commanded by the King of Granada, and they were compelled to raise the siege.  After this the Sultan Abi-l-hasan again applied himself further to strengthen  Gibraltar, by causing a thick wall to be built at the foot of the rock, surrounding it  on all sides, as the halo surrounds the crescent moon; so that the enemy could  discover no prospect of success in attacking it, nor did there appear any way  through which he could force an entrance. In the course of time, however,  Algesiras became the prey of the infidels in consequence of the defeat which Abi-l-  hasan, together with Ibnu-l-ahmar [Abi-l-hejaj Yusuf], suffered at Tarifa; and  Gibraltar was afterwards taken from the Beni Merin by Mohammed, surnamed  Al-ghani-billah, Sultan of Granada, to whom Lisdnu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattib was  Wizir.

Alas! God Almighty,  ‘‘ whose decrees are infallibly executed upon his creatures, had decided in his  “infinite wisdom that this proud armament should be dispersed like the dust  “‘ before the wind, and that Abi-l-hasan himself should return to his dominions  “* vanquished and fugitive-—that the sharp-edged swords of the infidels should shine  ‘over his head and those of his men. We will not inquire how it happened ;  “ but the fact is, that thousands of Moslems won that day the crown of martyrdom ;  ‘* that the ranks of doctors and theologians were frightfully thinned, the law of the  ‘“‘ sword being executed on their throats: the Sultén’s own son, and all his harem,  “fell into the hands of the victorious enemy ; his treasures became the prey of |  “ the idolaters, who from that day thought of nothing short of subjecting the rest  ‘‘of Andalus to their abominable rule. Among the illustrious Moslems who  “ perished on that occasion was ’Abdullah As-salmani, the father of the Wizir  “ Lisdnu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattib. He was an able physician and an eminent scholar.  “The battle of Tarifa’ was fought on Monday, the 7th of Jumada the first, of  “ the year 741 (Oct. 29, a.p. 1340).”   Yisuf Abi-l-hej4j was one of the most enlightened sovereigns of the Nasserite  dynasty. In his days justice was administered with an even hand, literature and  science flourishéd, and public order prevailed. Unluckily for the Moslems of  Andalus, his reign was not of long duration ; for, in the year 755 (beginning Jan.  25, a.p. 1354), he was assassinated by a madman whilst performing his devotions  in the mosque of his palace. The event is thus described in a letter which the  Wizir Ibnu-l-khattib addressed, in the name of his brother and successor, Mo-  hammed, to Abt Indn [Féris], Sultan of Western Africa.   “ As Abt-l-hej4j was performing the last prostration of his prayer, a madman  ‘rushed upon him and wounded him with a khanjar or yataghén. The assassin  “‘ was immediately secured. The Sultan, who had been mortally wounded, made  “some signs, as if he wished to speak; but, after uttering a few unintelligible  ‘words, he was carried senseless to his palace, where he died shortly after his  ‘‘ arrival. The assassin, in the mean time, was given up to the infuriated mob,  ‘‘ who murdered him and burned his body. Abi-l-hejaj was interred on the  “ evening of Sunday within the Alhambra, in the cemetery reserved for the princes    ",394,book_8,

He left three sons: Mohammed, who succeeded him;  “Isma’il, and Kays.”   Mohammed, surnamed Al-ghani-billah (he who is contented with God), suc- ccessionloray  ceeded. Some time after his accession he dispatched to Fez his Wizir, Lisanu-d- .  din Ibnu-l-khattib, with instructions to implore the aid of Abi ""Indn [Faris];  son of Abii-l-hasan, against the common foe. Upon being introduced to the  Sultan’s presence, and before he had delivered the message of which he was  the bearer, Ibnu-l-khattib uttered extempore some verses which called forth the  admiration of all those present, and were so much approved of by the Sultan,  that before listening to what Ibnu-l-khattib had to say, he told him, ‘ By Allah!   I do not know what the object of thy visit is, but whatever it may be, I from  this moment grant thy request ;’ and so he did, for, after loading him with  presents of all kinds, he promised to send troops to the assistance of his master,  and dismissed him highly pleased and satisfied with the result of his mission.  This circumstance elicited from the celebrated K4di Abt-l-k4sim Ash-sherif, who  formed also part of the embassy, the very just remark, that there never was an  ambassador who obtained the object of his mission before he had made it known,  save Ibnu-l-khattib. .   “ Mohammed had reigned scarcely five years,” says the historian Ibnu Khaldin, His half-    brother Isma’il    ‘* when a half-brother of his, named Isma’il, assisted by another of his relatives, of the revolts against  “name of Abt Sa’id, revolted in Granada; and, taking advantage of the absence  “ of the Sultan, who was then residing at a country place out of the Alhambra,  “scaled at night the walls of that fortress, and made himself master of it, after  “ putting to death Redwan, the Wizir of Mohammed. This took place on the  “27th day of Ramadhan, 760 (Aug. 23, a.p. 1359), and, on the following day,  “ Tsma’{l Abi-l-walid was proclaimed by the troops and the citizens.  ‘In the mean time the dethroned Sult4n, having found means to escape from Ses in  ‘‘ his pursuers, repaired to Guadix, where he established his authority.

He sent immediately [to Andalus] a theologian  “of his court, named Abi-l-késim Ibn Sherif,° with instructions to invite the  ‘‘ deposed Sultan to his court. On his arrival [at Granada], Abi-l-késim nego-  “tiated with the great officers of the state and the ministers of the usurper,  ‘‘that Mohammed should be allowed to leave Guadix and proceed to Africa  ‘“‘ unmolested, and that all those individuals who had been arrested and imprisoned  “ for their fidelity to the deposed Sultan should be set at liberty. In their number  “was the Katib Abd ’Abdillah Ibnu-l-khattib, who, owing to his intimacy with",395,book_8,

Another writer says that Ibnu-l-khattib owed his  ‘liberation to Ibn Marzik,’ the Wizir of Abi Sdlim, who was an old friend of  ‘his ever since his stay at Granada; for he had no sooner heard of his friend’s  ‘“‘ imprisonment than he prevailed upon his master the Sultén, whose confidence  “‘ he enjoyed, to send an embassy to Andalus, &c. However this may be, Ibnu-l-  ‘‘ khattib was released and allowed to proceed to Guadix in company with Abi-l-  “ kdsim, the African ambassador. On his arrival there, Ibnu-l-khattib found his  ‘‘ master preparing to cross over to Africa. Mohammed took his departure at  “the end of Dhi-l-ka’dah, and he accompanied him and arrived in this country  “at the end of 760 (Nov. a.p. 1359). On the news of Mohammed’s approach,  “ Abi Salim went out in state to receive him, and he was soon after admitted  “ into a hall of the royal palace crowded with courtiers, theologians, poets, and  “doctors. It was on this occasion that his Wizir, Ibnu-l-khattib, uttered ex-  ‘‘ tempore that celebrated ode of his, rhyming in ra, the argument of which was  ‘‘to implore his aid in favour of his master, and to ask him to restore him to  “ the possession of his throne.  “O Vicar of God! May the Almighty increase thy power as the full moon  ‘ shines through the shadows of night.  ‘May the hands of his omnipotence avert from thee that [evil] against  ‘ which mortals have no power.’ ”’®  Ibnu Khaldtn, from whom the above details are borrowed,® says, ‘‘ Such was  “ the effect produced upon the audience by Ibnu-l-khattib’s verses that they were  ‘unable to suppress their tears. When the interview was over, Mohammed  “ retired to the palace which had been prepared for him, the apartments of which  ‘‘he found strewed with the finest carpets, and the stables well provided with  ‘* generous steeds, with their trappings and saddles ornamented with gold. Hand-  “some robes of the most costly stuffs were sent in, as well as slave girls for him  ‘‘and those of his suite; in short, nothing was wanting to make their residence  “at court agreeable. Mohammed, moreover, was treated with every distinction,  “and, whether he rode or walked out of his palace, the same honours were paid  ‘to him as to the Sultan, only that Mohammed would never assume the titles  ‘‘ of royalty, out of respect for his host. Mohammed and his suite stayed at  “Fez until the year 763, when they all returned to Andalus, and that Sultan  ‘ regained possession of his throne.”  So far Ibnu Khaldin, whose narrative differs in some material points from that  of Ibnu-l-khattib, since he places the revolution of Granada and the murder of  Redwan on the 27th of Ramadhan, and the latter writer, who is no doubt right,",396,book_8,
"    CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 359    says that it happened on the 28th. The date of Mohammed’s departure from  Guadix is also differently given. Ibnu-l-khattib, in his Lamahatu-l-bedriyyah, says  “that it took place the day after the festival of the victims (the 11th of Dhi-l-  “ hajjah) ;” Ibnu Khaldiin says, in Dhi-l-ka’dah ; but perhaps this was an error of  the scribe, who, instead of Dhi-l-hajjah, wrote Dhi-l-ka’dah. But as we are  enabled to furnish the lovers of information with Ibnu-l-khattib’s own account  of these transactions, we will transcribe it here, in order that they may compare  the narratives of both historians.  Lis4nu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattib, in his historical work entitled Al-lamahatu-|- Yonu-!-    khattib’s ac-    bedriyyah ft tdrtkh daulati-n-nasriyyah (the shining rays of the full moon: on the eomat ot ieee  history of the Nasserite dynasty), says, ‘‘ The Sultan Abi ’Abdillah had upon his  “accession to the throne confined his half-brother Isma’il to one of his father’s  “* palaces, near the river Daroh (Darro), which he provided with every thing required  ‘‘ for that prince’s comfort, allowing him besides a considerable pension upon his  ‘treasury. He had also sent thither Fatimah, the prince’s mother, and all her sons.  “It appears, however, that on hearing of Yuisuf’s death, the mother of Isma’il was  ‘enabled, through the treasures which the deceased had left in her apartments,  “to create a party against his son Mohammed. Fatimah had a daughter whom  ‘* Abi-l-hejaj had married to his nephew the Reys Abi ’Abdillah, son of the Reys  “ Abi-l-walid, son of the Reys Abti ’Abdillah (he who was once proclaimed king at  “ Andarax),'® son of the Reys Abi Sa’id, the father of their race, and the stock  “from which the other branches of the family were descended. This daughter  ‘‘ Fatimah gained over to her interests, and she persuaded her husband to enter into  ‘the plot. The Reys Abi ’Abdillah, having therefore succeeded in attaching to his  ‘* party all the discontented, sallied forth one night with about one hundred armed  “men, and directed his course towards a certain quarter of the Alhambra. Here,  “‘ however, he found himself suddenly stopped by walls of considerable height,  “‘ which he had not the means of scaling; but ladders were procured, and the  “ conspirators ascended to the ramparts. Having put to death a sentry who  ‘came in their way, in order to secure his silence, they rushed sword in hand  “‘ within the precincts of the castle, uttering seditious cries, and murdering all  ‘* those whom they happened to meet. This took place a little before daybreak  ‘‘on the 28th of Ramadhan of the year 760 (Aug. 24, a.p. 1359). The con-  “* spirators first attacked the residence of the Hajib Redwan,"" and breaking open  “the doors, rushed into his harem and murdered him amongst his children and  “‘ wives ; after which they fell to plundering the contents of his house.

This garden was  ‘“‘ only separated from the royal residence by a high and strong wall, defended  “by a deep moat. In this place the Sultén was suddenly awakened by the clatter  “‘ of arms, the cries of the assailants, and the beating of drums in the distance.  ‘Not knowing what caused the tumult, Mohammed went out in the direction  “of the Alhambra; but finding that the conspirators occupied all the avenues,  “he retraced his steps, and God was pleased to provide for his salvation ; for,  ‘having mounted a fleet steed which was always kept saddled and prepared for  “him, he galloped off to Guadix, where he arrived safely the same morning, and  “* presented himself to the governor of the castle, who was very far from suspecting  ‘what had happened to him. Mohammed was soon after visited by the chief  ‘inhabitants of the place, who all swore to protect him, so that he not only  “reigned undisturbed over Guadix and its immediate neighbourhood, but soon  “ saw himself at the head of numerous followers, who hastened to him from all  ‘* parts.   “Meanwhile his brother, the usurper, dispatched an embassy to the King of  “ Castile, offering to renew the treaty of peace then existing between the two  “countries. Pedro—for such was the name of the Christian king at the time—  “ happening then to be at war with the people of Barcelona, readily assented to  ‘“‘the proposition. Isma’il, however, did not long enjoy the power which he had  “usurped. Scarcely were six months elapsed since his proclamation, when the  “ same man who had contributed to his accession precipitated him from his throne.  “ Abi ’Abdillah revolted against him, besieged him in the Alhambra, took him  “‘ prisoner, and put him to death, together with his brother Kays, on the 4th  “ of Sha’ban, 761 (June 20, a.p. 1360). Isma’il was born on Monday, the 28th  “ of Rabi’ the first, of 740 (Oct. 3, a. p. 1339) ; he was surnamed Abi-l-walid.   “ Abd ’Abdillah [Mohammed VI.'*] was immediately proclaimed, and reigned  “for about two years, at the expiration of which, seeing himself pressed on one  “‘ side by the rightful sovereign, who burned to revenge the outrage done to him,  ‘and to recover the throne of his ancestors, and on the other side by Pedro, King",398,book_8,
"    CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 361    “* of Castile, he came to the strange resolution of throwing himself on the mercy ine  “of the latter and repairing to his court. He might just as well have thrown Pedro, King of  ‘‘himself into the mouth of a hungry tiger thirsting for blood; for -no sooner  “had the infidel dog cast his eye over the countless treasures which Mohammed  “and the chiefs who composed his suite brought with them, than he conceived  “the wicked design of murdering them and appropriating their riches; and on  “the 2nd day of Rejeb, 763 (April 27, a. p. 1362), he was assassinated, with all  ‘his followers, at a place called Tablada, close to Seville.   “« But to return to the dethroned Sultén: the people of Guadix persevered firmly  ‘‘in their allegiance to him, protected his person, and swore to devote their lives  ‘‘and property to his defence. Things continued thus until the day of the  “* festival of the victims, [10th Dhi-l-hajjah] of the year 760 (a. p. Nov. 2, 1359),  ‘when an ambassador of the Sultan of Western Africa came to Guadix to say  “that if Mohammed would repair to his court and fix his residence in Fez, he  “* would be treated as a friend and ally. Soon after his dethronement, Mohammed  ‘had sent an embassy to the king of the Christians, imploring his help against  “the usurper. Pedro received his ambassadors well, but dismissed them with  “‘ only vague promises of help. Seeing, therefore, that his request was not com-  “plied with, Mohammed resolved upon accepting the Sultdn’s offer, and he  “accordingly set off on his journey on the day after that festival [11th of Dhi-l-  “ hajjah], followed by a numerous retinue of the inhabitants of Guadix, some on  ‘horseback and others on foot. Mohammed arrived at Marbella,* on the coast,  ‘‘ whence he crossed over to Africa. He made his public entrance into Fez  “on the 6th day of Moharram of 761 (Nov. 27, a.p. 1359), after experiencing  “on his way thither the greatest marks of distinction and hospitality. On his  “‘ approach the Sultén rode out to meet him, and having embraced him with the  “ greatest cordiality, conducted him to his capital, where he allotted him a fine  ‘* palace for his residence, and a considerable pension for his daily expenses.   ** At last, on the morning of Saturday, the 27th of the month of Shawwél of the  “ year 762 (Aug. 29, a.pv. 1361), after a stay of upwards of twenty-one months,  “* Mohammed returned to Andalus.

His authority was so much increased  “« by this public manifestation of his sentiments, that his party was soon strengthened  “ by all those who had been formerly obliged to quit the country, and who now  “ flocked under his standard; and Mohammed had thus an opportunity of judging  ‘“‘ how much he was beloved by the generality of his subjects, from the alacrity  “with which they hastened to place themselves under his obedience, and the  “* joyful voices with which they proclaimed his name. Indeed, God Almighty was  “« pleased to receive our good master under the shade of his mercy, and to incline  ‘in his favour the hearts of his subjects, by persuading them that he was injured  “and ill-treated by the usurper. Mohammed, therefore, was defended by the  “‘ brave, and his cause speedily embraced by the righteous and the honest. He  “is now residing in Ronda, where he has established his rule and reigns un-  “ disturbed, as well as over the neighbouring districts. The charge of Wizir to  “‘ this Sultan is now filled by the Sheikh and Kéyid Abd-l-hasan ’Ali Ibn Yusuf  “‘Tbn Koméshah Al-hosri, and that of Katib or secretary by the Faquih Abi  “Abdillah Ibn Zomrad.”   The above is borrowed from the Lamahatu-l-bedriyyah ft tdrtkh daulati-n-  nasriyyah, so often quoted in the course of our narrative. The reader, however,  must know that after the death of the usurper, Abi ’Abdillah, who, as before  related, was assassinated by the tyrant Don Pedro, Mohammed returned to Granada  and recovered his lost kingdom. We find that he made his triumphant entry into  his capital on Saturday, the 20th of Jumada the second, 763 (April 6, a. p. 1362).   We have already stated that after a short stay in Africa, Mohammed returned  to Andalus, and regained possession of his father’s dominions in 763. According  to Ibnu-l-khattib this happened thus: ‘‘ On the first breaking out of the rebellion  “by which Mohammed was deprived of his throne, ""Othman Ibn Yahya Ibn  “°Omar, Sheikhu-l-ghozdt, or commander of the African volunteers, fearing the  “‘ vengeance of the usurper Isma’il, deserted over to the Castilians in company  “with his father. Shortly after, Yahya crossed over to Africa, but ’Othmén  “remained in Andalus, supporting with all his might the cause of the deposed  “Sultan. Perceiving, however, that the Castilian king was unwilling to grant  ‘‘the promised assistance, and that he could not otherwise serve his master’s  “ cause, Othman wrote to ""Omar Ibn ’Abdillah, at that time Wizir of Abi Salim,  “asking to be put in possession of one of the fortresses still held in Andalus  “by the Beni Merin, that he might thence wage war against the usurper. It  “‘ happened that the above Wizir was a great friend of mine, as there had existed  ‘‘ between us an intimacy of very long standing, and my master having con-",400,book_8,
"    CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 363    “ sulted with me about ’Othman’s proposition, I approved of it, and went imme-  “« diately to the dwelling of the Wizir Omar, who, at my request, issued orders  “* that the castle of Rorida should be given up to the friends of the deposed Sultan,  ‘* which was done, ’Othmdn taking immediate possession of it in his name. Shortly  “ after, Mohammed sailed for Andalus ; and his presence having infused new vigour  “into the souls of his partisans, the whole of the Gharbia or western districts  ‘submitted to him: he then took Malaga, and marched to Granada, which sur-  ‘“‘ rendered to him without opposition, and he thus saw himself again in possession  “ of his father’s dominions.”   Ibnu-l-khattib had remained behind in Africa for the purpose of escorting the  wives and sons of Mohammed, whom that Sultan left behind on his departure  for Andalus. Immediately after his return [to Granada], he was restored to the  post of Wizir, which he occupied before, and to the unlimited confidence of his  sovereign, especially after the disgrace of ""Othman, who was exiled to Africa in  Ramadhan of the year 764 (June or July, a. p. 1363) ; but, alas! envy, against whose  poisonous shafts no mortal stands secure, chose him for the butt of her malignity,  and he fell a victim to the most atrocious calumny, and the most perfidious and  treacherous slander, as we will hereafter relate.   It would appear that the great favour which Ibnu-l-khattib enjoyed with his Lamentabie  sovereign—who showed such regard and affection for him that he would consult Wieir, Tbnu-l-  him on the most trifling business, and admit him and his sons to his private Khattib.  parties—displeased some envious and ill-intentioned people about the court, who  from that moment began to indispose the mind of the Sultén towards him by  calumnies and false reports. Ibnu-l-khattib, however, having received timely in-  telligence of their wicked plans, sought to avert the intended blow by embracing  the party, and serving the cause, of ’Abdu-l-’aziz, son of Abi-l-hasan, Sultén of  Western Africa, against his cousin ’Abdu-r-rahm4n Ibn Abi Yaghalis, son of the  Sultén Abi ’Alf, son of the Sultén Abu Sa’id, son of the Sult4n Ya’kib Ibn ’Abdi-l-  hakk, who was a competitor for the empire. After many events and wars, which  it would take us too long to relate, Abdu-r-rahmdn had been obliged to cross  over to Andalus, together with his Wizir Mes’id Ibn Masdi, and to take refuge  in Granada, where they were kindly received by the Sultén in 767. Shortly after,  *Ali, son of Bedru-d-din, who occupied the post of Sheikhu-l-ghozdt, or general  of the African volunteers in Granada, died, and ’Abdu-r-rahmén was appointed  to the vacant office. This show of favour towards the exiled prince displeased  *Abdu-l-’aziz, who had no sooner solidly established his power by the death of  the Wizir Omar Ibn ’Abdillah, whom he caused to be executed, than he dispatched  an embassy to the Sultén of Granada, to complain bitterly of his having given",401,book_8,
"    364 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book VIII.    shelter to his enemy, whom he knew to be in correspondence with the discontented  in Africa, and to ask him to deliver this enemy into his hands. On the receipt  of this message Mohammed was greatly perplexed, and having consulted with  Ibnu-I-khattib, the latter advised him to seize the persons of Ibn Abi Yaghalis  and his Wizir Mes’td, and thereby free himself from all responsibility, on condition,  however, that ’Abdu-l-’aziz should restore them to all the honours and dignities  of which they were in possession before their revolt. Mohammed followed the  advice of his Wizir, and an agreement was accordingly entered into between that  sovereign on one side, and the ambassador of the Sultan ’Abdu-l-’aziz, named  Abi Yahya Ibn Abi Medin, on the other, purporting that both ’Abdu-r-rahmén  and his Wizir Ibn Masai should be arrested, which was done. Shortly after this,  Ibnu-l-khattib, having received intelligence that his enemies were again at work,  and had strongly prejudiced the mind of his sovereign against him, fled from  Granada. He no doubt imagined that the Sultan would in the end listen to their  calumnies, and that as they were his sworn enemies, he had no chance of escape  from them. However this may be, having asked his master’s leave to visit the  frontiers, he hastened thither, accompanied by a handful of horsemen, taking with  him his eldest son ’Ali, who was a favourite of Mohammed. Having arrived at  Jebalu-l-fatah (Gibraltar), he embarked on board a vessel which ’Abdu-l-’aziz,  who was in the secret, held in readiness for him, and sailed for Ceuta, where he  arrived after a few hours’ passage, and was received by ’Abdu-l-’aziz with every  mark of attention and respect.   In 774, ’Abdu-l-’aziz died, and was succeeded by As-sa’id Ibn Abi Faris, then an  infant ; upon which the Beni Merin, leaving Telemsdn, returned to Western Africa.  Tbnu-l-khattib went thither also in the suite of the Wizir Abi Bekr Ibn Ghazi,  who was then at the head of affairs, and settled at Fez, where he bought houses  and lands, and passed his time in building and planting, intending to fix his resi-  dence in that city. Abt Bekr, moreover, confirmed Ibnu-l-khattib in all the  honours and prerogatives which he had enjoyed under the Sultan ’Abdu-l-’aziz.  In the mean time, Mohammed of Granada, having discovered the flight of his Wizir,  was exceedingly angry with him, and even swore to put him to death if ever he  should fall into his hands. Ibnu Khaldtin says, that during his residence at  Telemsan, Ibnu-l-khattib had instigated the Sultan ’Abdu-l-’aziz to take possession  of Andalus, and that he had described to him the facility of the enterprise; and  it is even added that ’Abdu-l-’aziz went from Telemsin to Western Africa for  the express purpose of making preparations for the expedition. When Ibnu-l-  ahmar (Mohammed) received intelligence of his plans, he sent him an embassy  with a splendid present, consisting of different objects of Andalusian manufacture,",402,book_8,
"    CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 365    besides fine horses, swift mules, handsome Christian slaves, and so forth, asking  that his Wizir Ibnu-l-khattib should be given up to him. ’Abdu-l-’aziz, however,  refused to grant his request, and Ibnu-l-khattib remained at his court, enjoying  all his favour and confidence. On the death of ’Abdu-l-’aziz, Ibnu-l-ahmar  (Mohammed) renewed his solicitations with the Wizir Abi Bekr; but he was again  refused, and his ambassador even dismissed from court. Enraged at the insult,  Ibnu-l-ahmar released *Abdu-r-rahmdn Ibn Ali Yaghalis from his captivity, and  having provided him with a fleet, sent him over to Africa. He himself left Granada,  at the head of considerable forces, and laid siege to Gibraltar. Hearing of his move-  ments, Abii Bekr Ibn Ghazi sent to Ceuta a cousin of his named Mohammed Ibn  ’Othmén, to defend that place against any attempt of Ibnu-l-ahmar, whilst he  himself marched to encounter ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, who had been proclaimed by the  inhabitants of Batttiyyah. After besieging him some time in that town, Abi Bekr  raised the siege and retired to Tezzd, and thence to Fez; upon which his enemy  advanced upon the former city and made himself master of it. Whilst the Wizir  Abt Bekr Ibn Ghazi was deliberating as to What steps he should take, news came  to him how his cousin, Mohammed Ibn ’Othmén, had proclaimed at Ceuta Ahmed  Ibn Abi Salim, better known by his surname of Dhi-l-daulateyn (he of the two  reigns), because he was twice Sultan, this being the first time. The reasons which  prompted that governor to take such a step are said to have been as follow.  During the siege of Gibraltar, which Mohammed reduced almost to the last  extremity, a correspondence was established between that Sultén and Ibn Othman,  in which the latter failed not to complain most bitterly of the Wizir Abé Bekr  Ibn Ghazi, and to declare that he was prompted to make war by no other  reason than the uncourteous manner. in which his just request had been denied.  The two parties soon came to an understanding; it being agreed between them  that Mohammed Ibn ’Othmdn should immediately proclaim at Ceuta one of the  sons of the Sultin Abd Silim, who were in custody at Tangiers, by which means  the Moslems would have a grown-up prince for their ruler instead of a mere child,  as As-sa’id Ibn Abi Faris was at the time; and the choice of Ibnu-l-ahmar fell  on Ahmed Ibn Abi Salim, whom he saved, as it were, from certain death. Ibnu-l-  ahmar, moreover, entered into a compact with Mohammed Ibn ’Othman, the con-  ditions of which were,—first, that the fortress of Gibraltar should be given up  to him; that all the princes of the Beni Merin should be sent over to him, that  they might be under his custody and keeping; and, lastly, that the person of  Ibnu-l-khattib should be delivered into his hands. Mohammed having accepted  the above conditions, rode from Ceuta to Tangiers, and having released Abi-l-  ’abbds Ahmed [Ibn Abi Sélim] from his place of confinement, took the oath of",403,book_8,
"    366 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book vir.    allegiance to him, and induced the inhabitants to do the same, their example  being soon after followed by the inhabitants of Ceuta and Gibraltar; upon which  Ibnu-l-ahmar raised the siege of that fortress and went away. Shortly after,  Mohammed Ibn ’Othmén sent orders, in his master’s name, to the governor of  Gibraltar, to surrender the place to Ibnu-l-ahmar ; upon which that Sult4n hastened  thither from Malaga, and as the inhabitants were desirous to return under his  tule, he took possession of that important fortress, the last which the Beni Merin  ever possessed in Andalus. Ibnu-l-ahmar then sent a splendid present to Abi-l-  ’abbds, and at the same time sent him a body of troops, and a considerable sum  of money, to help him in his enterprise. After many events and wars, which we  pass over at present,—as it is our intention to relate them at full length in another  part of this work,—Abi-l-’abbds defeated his adversary, and at the beginning of  776 (June, a. D. 1374), took possession of Fez, into which he made his triumphant  entry, accompanied by his Wizir Mohammed Ibn ’Othmén, and Suleymaén Ibn  Dawiid, the chief of the Beni ’Askar.   We have already stated that an agreement had been entered into between Abi-1-  *abbis and the Sultd4n Ibnu-]-ahmar [Mohammed V.], at the time the former was  proclaimed at Tangiers, that as soon as he gained possession of the throne he would  seize on Ibnu-l-khattib and deliver him up to him. Accordingly, when the Sultén  Abi-l-’abbés Ahmed, after defeating the troops commanded by Abi Bekr Ibn Ghazi  in the outskirts of Fez, invested that capital, Ibnu-l-khattib, fearing for his life,  fled with him to new Fez. A few days after, Suleyman Ibn Dawid put the Sultdn  in mind of his promise, and Ibnu-l-khattib was accordingly arrested and confined to  a dungeon, and messengers were dispatched to apprise Ibnu-l-ahmar of his capture.  This Suleyman was the sworn enemy of Ibnu-l-khattib, owing to the following  reason. During his residence in Africa, Mohammed had promised him that if  ever he was restored to his kingdom, he would appoint him to the office of  Sheikhu-l-ghozdt, or general of the African volunteers. Accordingly, no sooner  had Mohammed reconquered his kingdom, than Suleymén crossed over from  Africa, sent by the Wizir ""Omar Ibn ’Abdillah, asking for the fulfilment of his  promise ; but this was opposed by Ibnu-l-khattib on the plea that the office could  not be filled except by princes of the posterity of ’Abdu-l-hakk, and his application  was accordingly refused. Suleyman, therefore, had to return to Africa dis-  appointed, and swearing revenge against Ibnu-l-khattib. Subsequently to this,  Suleyman returned to Andalus to take the command of Gibraltar, the government  of which had been given to him, when an official correspondence was necessarily  kept up between the two, in which they not unfrequently disclosed the hatred  and animosity which they entertained for each other. However, when the news    ",404,book_8,
"    CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 367    of Ibnu-l-khattib’s capture reached Granada, Ibnu-l-ahmar sent for Abii ’Abdillah  Ibn Zomrok,’® who had succeeded Ibnu-l-khattib in the office of Katib and Wizir,  and sent him to Africa with instructions. Abid ’Abdillah having presented his  credentials to the Sultén Abi-l-’abbds, Ibnu-l-khattib was sent for and made to  appear before a privy council, presided over by that Sultén in person. He was then  charged with certain expressions contained in letters written to his friends, in which  he had cast ridicule over Abi-l-’abb4s, and when the witnesses had been examined  he was conducted back to prison. The judges were then consulted whether he  deserved death or not. A theologian of Fez undertook the defence of Ibnu-l-  khattib, upon which Suleyméan, fearing lest his innocence should be proved, and  he should lose the pleasure of anticipated vengeance, secretly instigated some of  his own servants to put that illustrious individual to death. The assassins did as  they were ordered; they went to Ibnu-l-khattib’s prison at night, accompanied by  a dwarf, who had come in the suite of the Granadian ambassador, and strangled  him. On the ensuing day his body was taken to the cemetery close to Babu-l-  mahrik, and there buried. Thus perished the phoenix of the age, the prince of  the poets and historians of his time, and the model of Wizirs.   During our stay in Fez we visited several times the spot where that eminent man  lies buried, which, as above stated, is close to the gate formerly called Bdbu-sh-  shar’iah (the gate of the law), and now Bédbu-l-mahrik (the gate of the burnt  man). The earth over his tomb has not been removed, and remains in the same  state as it was then. It is true that in order to reach it, it is now necessary to  descend considerably. It is commonly believed at Fez that the body of Ibnu-l-  khattib was exhumed by his enemies and burnt on the very night of its interment,  owing to which the gate was called Bdbu-l-mahrik. But that is not the case; for  it is a well-known fact that the gate in question received its name during the reign  of a Sultan of the posterity of ’Abdu-l-mtimen, owing to a rebel who rose in arms  against that dynasty having been made prisoner and burned close to it, which  event took place long before the birth of Ibnu-l-khattib, and even that of his  father ’Abdullah. The last time we visited the tomb of that extraordinary man  our sorrow was so great and our feelings were so excited, that we were well-  nigh overcome by our grief; even now the memory of his virtues and endearing  qualities, which has been carefully preserved in our family by the Sheikh Abi  *Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Al-makkari At-telemsani, who  was one of his tutors,!® brings tears to our eyes, and makes us detest his vile  detractors.

If we are to believe the his-  torians of that city, numerous were the warnings which the Moslems of Granada  received of the approaching chastisement of Heaven, and the ruin of their empire  was more than once announced. We recollect having read once, in the hand-  writing of the learned Hafedh, Katib, and historian, Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed  Tbnu-l-hadddd Al-wadi-ashi (from Guadix), who resided at Telemsdn, the following  anecdote, which we here transcribe, vouching for its veracity. ‘‘I was told by  “the Faquih Sidi Hasan, son of the Kéyid and general, the honourable Sidi  ‘* Tbrahim Al-’arrdf, that he was present at the taking down of the talisman known  ‘* as the weather-cock,? which once stood on the top of the old kassdbah at Granada,  ‘* and was removed on account of the improvements and repairs about to be made  “in that building.

Mohammed remained at claimed at  ‘* Malaga some time; after which he went to join his brother, and made his peace Malege.  “ with him, the captains and chiefs, who had contributed to his elevation, remain-  “* ing in that city without a leader.6 Things went on in this way until after some  “ time the people of Malaga rose in arms and proclaimed also Abi-l-hasan, whereby  “ the civil war was concluded, and that Sultan (Abi-l-hasan] became the supreme  ‘* master of all the Mohammedan dominions in Andalus.   ‘* No sooner did Abu-l-hasan see himself firmly seated on the throne than he  ‘* made war against the idolaters, and took from them several castles and strong  ** places; the lightnings (of victory] shone in his favour and against the infidel  “ enemy; they feared him, sought his friendship, and sued for peace. The armies  ‘‘of Abi-l-hasan having greatly increased in number, he decided to review  “them. To this effect he caused his architects to erect him a platform out of the  ‘* Al-hamrd, or castle of Granada. The review began on a Tuesday, the 19th of  ‘“‘ the month of Dhi-l-hajjah of the year 882 (March 24, a. p. 1478), and the troops  ‘* ceased not passing daily before him till the 22nd of Moharram of the following  “ year of 883 (April 24, a.p. 1478), when the review was completed.

The water reached as far as  “‘ the square where the great mosque stands. So frightful an inundation had never  “‘ before been experienced in the country, and the people naturally looked upon  ** it as the harbinger of the dreadful calamities which awaited the Moslems in just  ‘* chastisement for their perversity and their sins.   ‘** About this time the Castilian nobles were divided among themselves; one  “taking possession of the kingdom of Cordova, another of that of Seville, and a  “ third of Xerez.® Instead, however, of profiting by their dissensions, Abi-l-hasan  ‘* gave himself more than ever to pleasure, and, trusting the government into the  ‘“‘ hands of his Wizirs, entirely neglected the affairs of the state, and allowed his  ‘* army to be corrupted and to lose its discipline and courage. He also concealed  “himself from the sight of his subjects, and gave up all idea of military enterprise  ‘or attention to the affairs of the administration; all which was undoubtedly  ‘“‘ the work of God, that his supreme will might be accomplished. At the same  ‘time new taxes were imposed and all manner of oppressions and injustices  ‘* practised upon his subjects, who began openly to condemn his administration  ‘*and to execrate his rule. This was not all; fancying that the Christians would  “ not attack him, on account of the civil wars in which they were then engaged,  “* Abi-l-hasan caused several of his best generals to be executed.® It happened,  “ however, that the King of Castile took possession of the kingdom” after a long  ‘and bloody civil war; and having compelled the rebellious nobles, who had  “‘ opposed his authority, to submission, was now enabled to turn his arms against  “ the Moslems.   “« The Castilians soon found the means of mischief, as well as an opportunity of  “taking possession of the Moslem dominions under the following distressing cir-  ** cumstances. Abi-l-hasan had by his wife, a daughter of his uncle the Sultan Abi  ‘“*Abdillah Al-aysar (the left-handed), two male children, Mohammed and Yisuf ;  ‘* but he had another wife, on whom he doted, and by whom he had likewise issue.  “‘ She was a Christian lady, and, as the monarch had always evinced the greatest  “« predilection for her, fears were entertained lest he should neglect the sons he had  “* by his noble cousin for those of the Christian captive. This naturally gave rise to  ‘* dissensions and quarrels among the officers of the state and the servants of the  ‘* palace, and two factions were formed, some inclining to the sons of his wife  “* and some to the sons of the Christian captive.   ‘* About this time, too, and when the Moslems of Granada were most disturbed by  “‘ their private feuds and the cause above alluded to, the truce which the Christians    ",408,book_8,
"    CHAP. VII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 371    “‘ had concluded during their internal divisions expired. The people of Granada,   ‘“* moreover, complained to the Sultan of his Wizir and civil officers, who, they said,   oppressed them and treated them with unwonted tyranny and injustice. This eee of   increased the discontent still more, and things went so far that the inhabitants   of Granada loudly demanded the removal of the obnoxious Wizir and the other   public functionaries ; and as their petitions were disregarded by Abi-l-hasan, new   scenes of trouble and confusion ensued. The disaffection of the inhabitants and   the weakness of the government soon became known to the Christians, who, at   the expiration of the truce, marched against Al-hammah (Alhama) and took it by The Christians  e Alhama.   surprise. This event happened in 887 (Feb. a. p. 1482) ; the Castilians being com-   ‘* manded on the occasion by the Lord of Cadiz."" The assailants took the castle   and fortified themselves in it. They thence attacked the town, the streets of   which they filled with infantry and cavalry, slaying all the Moslems they met,   and taking the women captives; for they surprised the inhabitants in the middle   of their sleep, as if they were so many drunken men, and, therefore, unable to   offer resistance. Those whose fate it was to die were killed by the Christians :   some, however, contrived to escape, leaving their wives and children behind   them, and the Christians in entire possession of the town and what it contained.   ‘No sooner did the news of this disaster reach Granada than both the high and ea   ‘* the low hastened out to the relief of Alhama.

After this, the army of the Moslems being considerably   re-inforced by fresh bodies of cavalry and infantry which kept arriving from   Granada and other cities of the Moslem dominions, the siege was carried on with   increased vigour, and the greatest efforts were made to deprive the besieged of   water, by destroying the subterranean pipes which supplied the garrison. It soon   became evident, however, that Alhama could not be taken by force, upon which   the soldiers gave license to their tongues, and began to pour abuse and ridicule   upon their own officers and upon the Wizir who went in command of the army.   “Things were in this state when scouts came to the camp to announce the Reaaiae   arrival of the Christians in great force to the relief of Alhama; upon which the   Moslems raised their camp, and went forward to encounter the enemy.

The order for departure  “‘ was accordingly given, and the Christian re-inforcements entered Alhama whilst  “ the Moslems were departing from before its walls.   ‘Immediately after the Christians had entered Alhama, their officers held a  “council of war, in which it was discussed whether they should abandon the place  “ or keep possession of it: having decided for the latter course, they repaired and  “« increased the fortifications, and furnished the place with all kinds of military stores  ‘« and provisions, so as to render it capable of sustaining a long siege, after which the  “‘ Lord of Seville returned to his own states, having previously distributed among  ** the soldiers the spoil made in the city, and leaving part of his forces to re-inforce  “ the garrison.   “Some time after this the Moslems returned again to the siege of Alhama,  ‘which they pressed with greater vigour than ever.

This victory happened on™   “ the 27th of Jumada the first, of the same year“ (July, a. p. 1482).   ‘“* On the very same day in which this signal victory was gained, Abi ’Abdillah  “* Mohammed, and Abi-l-hej4j Yusuf, sons of the Sultén Abid-l-hasan, fearing Revelstoalas  “Jest their father, influenced by his Christian concubine, should deprive them of  “ their inheritance, and prefer his other sons to them, made their escape from  “ Granada, and took refuge in Guadix, which place submitted to them, as well  ‘‘ as Baza, Almeria, and even Granada in course of time, their father being obliged  “to withdraw to Malaga, which continued faithful to him.   “In the month of Safar of the year 888 (March, a. pb. 1483), all the Christian  “chiefs [on the frontiers] collected their forces, and marched together towards  ‘* Malaga and Velez. They were about eight thousand men, commanded by the  ‘“* Lords of Seville, Xerez, Ezija, Antequera, and other cities; notwithstanding  ‘‘ which they were unable to reduce one single fortress. Having, moreover,   “‘ dispersed in the passes and ravines of the mountains, they were attacked by   “* the people of Malaga and Velez, who went on pursuing and killing them wherever   ‘‘ they fled, until they arrived near Malaga, when some escaped, but the greater Tus Castilans  ‘* part were killed or made prisoners. It is asserted that upwards of three thousand Malaga.  “Christian knights were killed in this memorable rout, and that the prisoners,   ‘* in whose number were an uncle of the Castilian king,’® the governors of Seville,   “* Xerez, Antequera, and thirty more of their principal noblemen, amounted to  ‘two thousand.

Accordingly, when he heard that his father had  “‘ gone to Almuiiecar, he left Granada, at the head of the troops of that city, and  “ other forces collected from the eastern parts of his dominions, and invaded the  “territory of Malaga; but having encountered his father’s army at a place called  “« Ad-dab, a battle ensued in which Abi ’Abdillah was defeated, and obliged to  “* retum to his capital. Some time after this, Abi ’Abdillah, the Sultén of Granada,  “ hearing of the advantages which his father and uncle in Malaga had gained over  ‘the Christians, and the rich spoils they had collected on the occasion, pre-  ‘ pared also for an expedition against the infidels. Having, accordingly, collected  “the forces he had at hand, and those of the eastern districts, he started on the  “ first day of Rabi’ the first, of the same year (April, a.p. 1483), and arrived  “ soon afterwards in the territory of Lucena, slaying and making captives, plunder-  ‘“‘ ing and wasting the country. But the Christians of the neighbouring districts,  ‘having assembled under the Lord of Cabra, guarded all the mountain passes  “in the rear of the Moslems, and cut them off from their country. In this situa-  “‘ tion the Moslems were completely defeated, and almost the whole of the army  “‘ were either made prisoners or slain. Among the former was the Sultan himeelf,  “who, at first, was not recognised; but the Lord of Lucena, who knew him,  “coming up, claimed him as his prisoner, and seeing that the Lord of Cabra  “ wished to snatch his prize from him, departed that very night with his prisoner  “ to the court of the King of Castile, who, in acknowledgment of his signal service,  “raised him to the highest rank among his captains, and ever after intrusted to  ‘him every important enterprise.   ‘When the news of this disaster reached Granada, the chief inhabitants of that  “capital met together to deliberate, and came to the resolution of sending a  ‘* deputation to Malaga to offer the throne to Abi-l-hasan, which they did, the  ‘* deputies presenting him with the allegiance of their countrymen. Abv-l-hasan,  ‘“‘ however, having some time previous lost his sight from a paralytic affection,  ‘* and being, moreover, old and infirm, excused himself from resuming the govern-  “ment, and having renounced in favour of his brother Abi ’Abdillah, retired to  “ Almunecar, where he remained till he died. Abvi-l-hasan, therefore, was suc-  ** ceeded by his brother Abi ’Abdillah, better known by the surname of Az-zaghal.  “ During this time Abt ’Abdillah, the son of Abi-l-hasan, continued in captivity.   “In the month of Rabi’ the second, of the year 890 (April or May, a. p. 1485),  “the Christians invaded the territory of Malaga with considerable forces, and  ** reduced some castles and fortresses, as they had already done in the preceding  ‘‘ year. Having laid siege to a fortified town called Dhekwdn, they battered  ‘its walls until they made a breach through which one thousand men at arms",412,book_8,
"    CHAP. VII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 375    “ penetrated into the place. There happened, however, to be within the fortress at  “the time a considerable body of Moslems from the western districts and from  “ Ronda, who, falling suddenly upon the enemy, slew every one of those who had  “entered the town. Notwithstanding their discomfiture, the Christians persevered,  “until at last the garrison was obliged to capitulate and go out, surrendering the  “« place to the enemy.   “‘ In Jumada the first, of the same year (May or June, A. p. 1485), the Christians  ‘* besieged Ronda, which they knew to be ill defended, as the greater part of the  “ garrison had gone to the assistance of their brethren of Dhekw4n and other  “* fortresses besieged by the enemy. After battering the walls with their heavy  ‘artillery, the Christians made a large breach, and the garrison was obliged to  ‘* capitulate. After the surrender of Ronda, the whole of the neighbouring districts  ‘* of which that city was the capital submitted to the Christians, so that no place  “remained to the west of Malaga which did not acknowledge the rule of the  “infidel king; who, after distributing his army among the fortresses recently  ‘* conquered, in order that he might afterwards more effectually besiege Malaga,  “‘ returned to his dominions.   “ On the 19th of Shaban of the same year (Aug. 31, A. p. 1485) Az-zaghal left  “Granada for the purpose of inspecting his dominions, and providing for the  ‘« fortification of a certain castle on his frontier. As he was residing in the latter  “* place, news reached him that the enemy was in sight. Indeed, on the morning of  “the 22nd of Sha’bdén (Sept. 3, a.p. 1485), the Christians were to be seen  ‘encamped before the castle,!* whither they stole secretly during the night.  “However, when the enemy at daybreak saw our troops encamped near the  ‘ castle, they formed their squadrons and attacked their van-guard with great fury.  “ The first onset was unfavourable to the true believers, who, fighting in disorder,  ‘“‘ were easily broken, the Christians penetrating even to the tent of the Sultan;  “‘ but, recovering soon afterwards, the battle became general ; and God Almighty  “being pleased on this occasion to endow the faithful with fresh vigour and  ‘“‘ courage, the Christians were ultimately defeated with great slaughter. The  “‘ Moslems, however, were prevented from following up their success by the fear  “* of the main body of the Christian army, commanded by the King of Castile in  ‘* person, which was advancing towards that part of the country ; for it was evident  ‘“‘ that as soon as the fugitives should meet with the advancing troops they would  “retrace their steps. The Moslems collected on this. occasion considerable spoil,  “ and took a number of guns,!® which they placed in the neighbouring forts. After  “this, nothing occurred till the month of Ramadhan (Sept. or Oct. a. pv. 1485),  “« when the Christians laid siege to Cambil, battered its walls, and, when the breach",413,book_8,

When the Moslems who  ‘* were in the castle saw the Christians in possession of the town, they surrendered  ‘« by capitulation, and left the place, with their property and children, to retire to  ‘* other countries inhabited by the Moslems. Through the reduction of Cambil, in  ‘the Alpuxarras, many of the neighbouring villages remaining unprotected, the  ‘* inhabitants fled for refuge to other quarters, and many towns and forts fell into  “‘ the hands of the enemy,—such as Mushdkar (Muxacar), Illora, and others; for  ‘the Christian king so pressed the territory of the Moslems on all sides, that he  ‘* attacked no fortress which he did not take, and invaded no district which did not  ‘* immediately surrender to his arms.

He first granted liberty to his prisoner, the Sultan Abi ’Abdillah,  ‘and having furnished him with men, money, and other requisites, and given him  “a khila’h or dress of honour, sent him on towards the districts to the east of Baza,  ‘“‘ with the promise of helping him to the re-conquest of all his father’s dominions.  “* He also pledged his royal word that whoever among the Moslems would acknow-  “ ledge the authority of his ally, Abi ’Abdillah, and swear allegiance to him, should  “‘ be included in the treaty of peace existing between the two sovereigns, and enjoy  ‘all the security and advantages insured by the same. Abii ’Abdillah accordingly  “set off for Velez-Malaga, the inhabitants of which city submitted to him; after  ‘‘ which he caused the treaty of peace concluded with the Christian king to be  ‘‘ read to the inhabitants in the market-place. This circumstance was soon made  ‘* public, and being spread over the country by the demons of mischief, the Bayisin  ‘* (people of Baeza), who inhabited a separate suburb of Granada [the Albayzin],  ‘* people at all times notorious for their proneness to rebellion, their infidelity, and  ‘* their attachment to the Christians, began to plan a revolt in his favour. Being  ‘* joined in the attempt by some wicked and ill-disposed people, who were anxious  “* to sow division amongst the Moslems, as well as by many honest citizens, who, per-  ‘* ceiving the weakness of the state, were anxious to see peace once more established,  “ they raised the standard of revolt; and, urged on as they were by the demons of  ‘* discord and civil war and their wicked agents to infamous acts and contemptible  “‘ deeds, they proclaimed Abt ’Abdillah, the captive and friend of the infidels, for  “their Sultan. The consequences of this measure were that discord and civil war  ‘broke out in Granada, no doubt by the will of the Almighty, who had decreed  “‘ that this doomed country should fall a prey to the enemy. The inhabitants  “of the Albayzin persisting in their revolt, they were assailed with stones and  “* other missiles thrown from the towers and walls of the neighbouring castle, and",414,book_8,
"    CHAP. VII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 377    “the fire of civil war raged more fiercely than ever. This rebellion broke out  “on the 3rd of Rabi’ the first, of the year 891 (March 9, a. p. 1486), and lasted  ‘ till the middle of Juméda the first following (June, a. p. 1486).   “Whilst the two parties were thus contending, the intelligence was received at He hesieges  “ Granada that Abi ’Abdillah had taken possession of the city of Loxa, and that Loxa.  “ he showed a disposition to settle his differences with his uncle Al-zaghal, who still  “held the castle of Granada, and to make peace with him. Abid ’Abdillah offered  “to leave his uncle the undisturbed possession of Granada and the rest of his  “‘ dominions, on condition that he would give him, as a fief to be held of his crown,  “ Loxa or any other city, which it should please him to grant him, and that both  ‘sovereigns should in future act in concert against the enemies of their faith.  “‘ While these negotiations were on foot, the King of Castile invested Loxa with a  ‘ numerous army, well provided with all the necessaries for a siege. The Sultan  ‘* Abi ’Abdillah occupied it with a body of troops raised among the inhabitants  “ of the Albayzin, who, on hearing of his entrance into Loxa, had repaired thither  “‘ to the assistance of their chief, and in order to fulfil the duties of the jihdd. The  “* people of Granada, however, and those of other places, fearing lest the siege  “* of Loxa should only be a stratagem of the enemy, never went to the relief of that  “city. The Christians in the mean time pressed the siege with increased vigour,  ‘* until alarming rumours began to circulate among the besieged, purporting that  ‘* the attack had been preconcerted between the Castilian and Abi ’Abdillah during  ‘ the captivity of the latter. This and the taking of one of the suburbs induced  “the inhabitants of Loxa to surrender their city on the 26th day of Jumada  “‘ the first, of the year 891 (May 23, a. p. 1486).   “* After the taking of Loxa, most of the inhabitants took refuge in Granada; Abi  “‘*Abdillah only remained behind, which circumstance convinced the Granadians  ‘“‘ that his entrance into Loxa had been for the mere purpose of putting the  “‘ Christians in possession of that city, in pursuance of a plan preconcerted between  ‘* him and the King of Castile, and no doubt as the price of his ransom. To this  “* it must be added, that the Sultdn’s son, who had been retained as a hostage by the  “ Castilians, was now liberated, and that several messages and negotiations passed  “ between him and his partisans of the Albayzin, so that no doubt remained as to  “the truth of their suspicions. After the reduction of Loxa, the King of Castile  “returned to his own states, again taking with him the captive Sultén. About  “the middle of the ensuing month of Juméda the second (June, a.p. 1486), he  “attacked Al-birah ;” and after he had demolished part of the walls with his  ‘artillery, the inhabitants capitulated and removed to Granada. He next besieged   VOL. II. 3c",415,book_8,

As to the people of Columbera, they  ‘* surrendered without making any resistance, and, like the people of the other  “towns and castles, betook themselves to Granada.   “ After these conquests the enemy besieged the fortress Mont-ferid,” into which  “ they threw combustible matter and other projectiles. Having in this manner set  “* fire to a magazine where the provisions and military stores of the garrison were  “ kept, the place capitulated, and the inhabitants removed also to Granada. The  “ Christian king next attacked Sakhrah,* which he reduced in like manner, and  “having taken several more of the neighbouring fortresses, he filled them with  ““ men and stores, in readiness for the intended siege of Granada.   ‘The Castilian then returned to his dominions, taking his prisoner with him.  “ Before his departure, however, he entered into an agreement with Abi ’Ab-  ‘ dillah, that whoever voluntarily submitted to his rule should enjoy peace and  ‘“* security. The rumour of this treaty soon circulated about the country, as also  ‘that this concession was owing to a war which had just broken out between the  ‘* Castilian and the King of France. In pursuance of this plan, the captive Sultan  ‘* presented himself at Velez-Malaga, where he was well received by the inha-  “ bitants. From thence he sent to all the neighbouring towns, describing himself  ‘“as the bearer of peace and security, and promising that whoever submitted to  ‘his authority should have nothing to fear in future from the hostilities of the  “‘ Christians, such being the condition of a treaty which he said he had in his  ‘* possession, signed by the King of Castile, and to the observance of which that  ‘* sovereign had pledged his word. Very few people, however, placed any reliance  ‘in these promises, if we except the inhabitants of the Albayzin, who rose imme-  “ diately in favour of Abi ’Abdillah, and accepted the peace which he offered,  “making themselves the advocates of his truth and sincerity, and even using  ‘‘ reproachful and insulting language towards the inhabitants of Granada, who  “‘ adhered to the party of his rival; whereby discord and confusion reached the  “extreme. Not contented with this open manifestation of their sentiments, the  “ people of the Albayzin wrote to inform Abi ’Abdillah that were he to repair  ‘among them, with such proofs and documents as he said he was the bearer of,  “they would undoubtedly rise in his favour and acknowledge him for their    Abi ’Abdillah ‘* sovereign. Accordingly Abi ’Abdillah entered the Albayzin secretly, and when    is proclaimed    inthe Albayzin. “‘ he was least expected ; and, having made himself known to the inhabitants of that",416,book_8,

The entrance of Abi ’Abdillah into the Albayzin  ‘is said to have taken place on the 16th of the month of Shawwal of the year 891  “ (Oct. 17, a.p. 1486). His uncle, who was then in the Alhambra, retired to the  “ fortress, and civil war commenced; the King of Castile assisting his ally with  ‘‘ men, arms, money, wheat, gunpowder, and other articles; so that the power of  ‘* the rebel increased, war raged more fiercely than ever, and men became accustomed  ‘“* to massacre and plunder. This state of things lasted until the 27th of Moharram  ‘* of the year 892 (Jan. 24, a. p. 1487), when the people of Granada, with the Sultan  “at their head, attempted to storm the Albayzin, the doctors of the law having  ** previously declared that whoever formed alliance with the Christians, or tried to  ‘* subdue the country through their assistance, as also all those who abetted Abi  “*Abdillah in his plans, were guilty of rebellion against God and his Messenger.  “ Their attack, however, being feebly conducted, did not succeed.   ‘* After this the Sultan of Granada sent for the military chiefs and governors  “ of all the principal cities and districts in his dominions, such as Baza, Guadix,  “ Almeria, Almufiecar, Velez, Malaga, and others ; and, being all assembled in the  “capital, they bound themselves by a most solemn oath to act unanimously  “ against the enemies of their religion, and to hasten to each other’s assistance  “in case of attack from the Christian. The news of this compact having reached  “the Albayzin, the Sultan [Abi ’Abdillah], who reigned there, was so terrified  “that he sent immediately to apprise his ally, the King of Castile, of the deter-  ‘* mination taken by the Moslems; he himself shortly after quitted the Albayzin,  “and repaired to the neighbourhood of Velez with all his forces. From thence  “ Abi ’Abdillah dispatched his Wizir to Malaga and to Hisn-Al-munshat,* to  ‘* induce the inhabitants of those two places to submit to him, by showing them  “a copy of the treaty which he had concluded with the King of Castile, and  “alarming them with the prospect of danger from the Christians. This so far  “ succeeded that the inhabitants of Malaga and Hisn-Al-munshdét submitted to  “him, chiefly through fear of the Castilian king, and of his vengeance, and urged  “ on by their ardent wish for peace. It was not so with Velez; for when the chief  “* men of Malaga met the inhabitants and explained their motives for acknowledging  ‘the authority of Abd ’Abdillah, the latter refused to depart from what they had  “¢ promised to the Granadians and to the other Moslems of Andalusia.",417,book_8,

When the  “ news of this expedition reached Granada, the Sultdn assembled his council, and,  ‘* having consulted them as to what was to be done, it was unanimously decided to  ‘march to the assistance of the besieged, according to the agreement entered into  “with them. The Sultén therefore left Granada on the 24th of Rabi’ the second  “* (April 23, a. p. 1487), at the head of the forces of Guadix, and various detach-  ‘“* ments from the Alpuxarras.   “‘ When the Moslems came in sight of Velez-Malaga they found the Christians  ‘‘ besieging that city by sea and land.

Whilst the Moslems were advancing  “* to the charge, news came to the Sult4n Az-zaghal that the Lord of the Albayzin  ‘* had been proclaimed in Granada. The Moslems therefore engaged the Christians  “‘ irresolutely, and the consequence was that before the action became general,  “ they fled in great disorder, although their opponents gave evident signs of terror  ** at their approach. There is no power or strength but in God!   “The revolt at Granada having become known amongst the people, the army  “ retired to Guadix, and the Christians, who had raised the siege of Velez in order  ‘to encounter the Granadians, recommenced their operations against that place ;  “ and, having carried the suburb by storm, pressed closely on the besieged.   ‘“* The revolt in Granada took place on the 5th of Jumdda the first. When  ‘the people of Velez saw the determination of the enemy to take possession of  “the city, and that no hope of succour was left them after the retreat of the  ‘* Moslem army, they offered to capitulate, and the terms being agreed upon, they  ‘“* marched out of the city on Friday, the 10th of Juméda the first, of the same  ‘© year.   “ After the taking of Velez, all the towns east of Malaga, including the fortress  ‘“ of Koméresh (Comares), surrendered to the Christians, who, elated with success,  “‘ proceeded to the siege of that capital.

The siege was prose-  “cuted with increased vigour, and maintained with equal constancy, until the  “ blockade, being more effectually established by means of ditches and outposts  “on the land side, and of additional vessels by sea, all assistance from without  “‘was intercepted. However, a chosen body of Morabits having succeeded in  ‘* escaping the vigilance of the Christians, made their entrance into the city, and,  ‘‘ with their assistance, new sallies were made against the enemy and severe battles  ‘were fought. But the enemy, having succeeded in bringing their artillery to bear  “against the walls, got possession of one of the suburbs, from whence they so  “annoyed the inhabitants, and guarded so effectually the avenues of the city,  “that the scarcity of provisions began to be severely felt, and after some days  “‘ the people were obliged to feed on the flesh of their camels, horses, and asses.  “In this extremity the Moslems implored the help of their countrymen at home  ‘and of the Africans on the opposite shore; but all in vain,—no one stirred  ‘in their defence. Famine soon spread its ravages in the city, whose bravest  “‘ defenders daily fell victims to its fury. Yet with all this the ardour of the  ‘‘ inhabitants was unimpaired, and the same obstinate resistance was offered to  “ the attacks of the Christians as before. At last, weakened by their losses, and  “‘ despairing of receiving any assistance, either by land or sea, the inhabitants of  ‘‘ Baza began to negotiate with the Christians, and to ask for such terms as had  ‘‘ been granted to other places taken by them.

A series of  ‘* bloody battles was fought between the assailants and the besieged, in which the  ** Moslems had generally the advantage, upon which the Christians, despairing  “of taking the city by assault, removed their camp to some distance from the  “walls, and the inhabitants could go in and out of the town without being  “molested. Things remained in this state during the months of Rejeb, Sha’ban,  * and Ramadhan, the Moslems remaining all the time encamped outside the walls  ‘and ready to repel the attacks of the enemy. After this the Christians began  ‘to press the siege with greater vigour; and having brought their heavy artillery  ‘and battering engines nearer to the walls, they made repeated assaults, and  ‘* possessed themselves of some of the avenues leading to the city, so as to render it  “ very difficult, if not altogether impossible, to leave or enter the town. In Dhi-l-  ‘“‘ka’dah and Dhi-l-hajjah things grew still worse, and provisions of all kinds  “became exceedingly scarce. About the end of the latter month the Moslems,  “having examined the extent of their stores, found that they had but very few  ‘* in their magazines ; but they still persevered in their resistance, in the hope that  “* the Christians would raise the siege at the approach of winter.

The plan  “‘ was executed as it was conceived; one of the Spanish grandees entered the city  ‘on the excuse of settling the terms of the capitulation, but in reality to look  ‘‘ about and to ascertain the true state of the garrison, their means of defence, the  “« provisions which they had in store, &c., and to gain thereby a knowledge to guide  “‘ the Christians in the negotiation. Being deceived by appearances, the Christian  ‘* proposed to grant the people their lives and property, with liberty to remove  ‘* wherever they chose. These terms, however, were made to extend only to the  ‘ citizens of Baza, and on no account to the troops who had come to their as-  “sistance from Guadix, Almeria, and Almufiecar, who, by an article of the treaty,  ‘* were to be expelled from Baza by the inhabitants themselves before the capitula-  “ tion was signed. However, the people of Baza not choosing to subscribe to these  “terms, the negotiations were interrupted for some time, until at length the  “* Moslems, fearing lest their miserable condition, which they had so well managed  ‘to conceal from the enemy, should become manifest, gave their full assent to  “ the proposed terms; namely, that the capitulation should not include the people  “* of Guadix, Almeria, Almufiecar, and the Alpuxarras. The whole of those ex-  “ tensive districts then entered under the dominion of the Christians by means of  “* stipulations mutually agreed on between both nations, and with circumstances  ‘** some of which became public whilst others remained always a secret. Some of  “« the great people received money, and had other advantages and preferments.  “ On Friday, the 10th of Moharram of the year 895 (Dec. 4, a.p. 1489), the  “ Christians entered the castle of Baza and took possession of it, without the people  ‘‘ of the town knowing on what terms it had been surrendered. They were told  ‘“‘ that such of the Moslems as chose to remain in the town should enjoy peace  “and security, while those who preferred settling elsewhere would be allowed  “ to quit it with their arms and property. After this the Christians expelled the  “‘ Moslems from the city, and forced them to reside in the suburbs through fear of  “their revolting.  “ From Baza the King of Castile advanced towards the district of Almeria, the pumenieuod  “ whole of which submitted to him. Some time previous the Sultén of Guadix  ‘had gone to Almeria for the purpose of meeting the Castilian king and putting  “ the Christians in possession of all his towns, castles, and fortresses ; and having  ‘done so, the infidel king gave him the investiture of all those dominions on  ‘* condition that he would do him homage for them.

By his orders  “the governors of castles and towns adjacent to the Moslem territory began to  “court the friendship of our governors, by giving them money and presents in  ‘“‘ the name of their master, who, they said, was impressed with their fidelity and  “good qualities; but, in reality; his object was only to increase his prepara-  ‘tions of men and stores, and to provide such things as were requisite for his  ‘* military projects.   “He then took Borju-l-maléhah and other castles, and having repaired their  ‘* fortifications, and garrisoned them with troops, he converted them into so many  ‘€ outposts from which to besiege the capital.

This happened in the month of Rejeb of the year 895.   “« After several skirmishes between the Moslems and the Christians, the latter  “became convinced that nothing of any importance could then be undertaken   ** against Granada ; and after demolishing some forts, and repairing the fortifications   “* of others, for example, Borju-l-maléhah and Hamadan, which they garrisoned and   “ provided with every necessary, they returned to their territory. During the  ‘“enemy’s absence the Sultan of Granada attacked one of the castles held by  “the Christians, and, having taken it by storm, put the garrison:to the sword ;   “* after which, leaving a sufficient force in it, he returned victorious to Granada.   ‘In the same month of Rejeb, Abi ’Abdillah made an incursion into the   ‘* Alpuxarras, and entered some villages, the population of which, composed of  “‘ Christians and treacherous Moslems, their friends, took to flight at his approach :  ‘* proceeding from thence to Andarax, he made himself master of that fortress.  “This success was speedily followed by the entire submission of the districts of  “‘ the Alpuxarras, which, being recalled to Islam, again acknowledged the authority  “ of Abd ’Abdillah, and shook off the Christian yoke.   “A war now ensued between Abi ’Abdillah, the Sultan of Granada, and his heathen  “uncle Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Sa’d Az-zaghal, who marched to the and Az-zaghal.  ‘* Alpuxarras at the head of considerable forces.

As the place was  “ exceedingly strong, the besieged were enabled to repel the attacks of the Moslems,  ‘‘who were pressing the siege. Whilst things were in this state, intelligence  “‘ reached the camp of the Moslems that the King of Castile was again advancing  “* towards the meadow of Granada; and accordingly, on the third of Shawwal, the  “ Sultan raised the siege and retired to his capital, where he had no sooner arrived  “than he heard of the appearance of the enemy in the Vega, accompanied by  ‘“* such among the traitor Moslems as had forsaken their religion, or become the  “* subjects of the Christians.   “ After staying eight days in the Vega, the King of the Christians returned  “to his states, having previously dismantled and caused to be evacuated the  “ fortress of Borju-l-maléhah and another castle. On his way back to his dominions  ‘the infidel passed through the city of Guadix, from which he expelled all the  “ Moslems, so that no true believer remained either in the city or in its suburbs.  “« After this he demolished the castle of Andarax, fearing, no doubt, that the sur-  ‘ rounding country would revolt against his authority.   ‘When the Sultén Az-zaghal, viz., Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Sa’d, the  ““uncle of the Sultan of Granada, saw this, he hastened to cross over to the  “‘ opposite shore of Africa, and arrived at Oran, and from thence at Telemsdn,  “‘ where he settled, and where his descendants are residing to this day, being well  ‘known there under the appellation of Bena-s-sultdni-l-andalus (the sons of the  “ Sultén of Andalus).   “ After this the King of Castile repaired to the extreme frontiers of his kingdom,  “a war having broken out between him and the Franks. In the mean while, the  ‘“« Sultan of Granada marched against Burshénah (Purchena), which he besieged and  ‘took, making the garrison prisoners of war. About the same time the inhabitants  ‘‘ of Finiana made an attempt to shake off the Christian yoke; but the Christian  ‘* governor of Guadix having marched against them, the undertaking failed and the  “* Moslems were defeated. :   ‘** In the month of Dhi-l-ka’dah of the same year, the Sultan of Granada with-  “« drew the forces which he had in the Send, and the inhabitants of that district,  ‘* [seeing that they had no defence against the enemy], deserted their homes.   “« On the 12th of Jumada the second, of the year 896 (March 22, a. p. 1491), the  “ King of Castile marched his army into the plain of Granada, and began destroying  “‘ the crops, demolishing the towns and villages, and subduing the whole country.  “He also laid the foundations of a town with walls and a ditch, the building  ‘of which he superintended in person. It had been reported at Granada that  “the Christians intended to raise the siege of that capital and return to their         ",424,book_8,

The contest  “lasted for seven consecutive months, and the Moslems were reduced to great  extremities ; but still, as the Christians were encamped at some distance from  Granada, and the communication between that city and the Alpuxarras was not  yet intercepted, the inhabitants received abundant supplies from the district of  Jebal-Sholayr (Sierra Nevada). But when the winter came on, and frost and snow  covered the ground, the produce of the earth grew less, its conveyance to Granada  became more difficult, and provisions became gradually so scarce, that famine  “ began to be felt in that capital. The enemy, too, had purposely taken possession  of almost every patch of ground out of the city, so that it became impossible to  gather any crops from the surrounding fields, and the condition of the besieged  became every day more distressing and hopeless. This was about the beginning  “of the year 897 (Nov. a.p. 1491). It was evident that the enemy’s design  was to reduce the city by famine, and not by force of arms. Things being  brought to this plight, great numbers of the inhabitants quitted Granada and  fled to the Alpuxarras. Provisions grew every day more scarce, and in the month  of Safar of the same year (Dec. a. p. 1491) the privations of the people became  “almost intolerable. The inhabitants then began to deliberate among themselves  as to the expediency of surrendering to the enemy. They therefore sought the  advice of their Ulemas and other learned men, who recommended them to look  to their own safety, and consult over the matter with the Sultan.   ‘“* Agreeably to this opinion, the Sultén convened his officers of state and coun-  cillors, when this important affair was discussed in his presence. The people  then said, ‘The Christians are daily receiving re-inforcements, while we have  none to expect; we all thought and expected that, at the approach of winter,  the Christians would have raised the siege and retired to their country, whereas  our hopes have completely failed; they have built a town in front of our city,  and pressed the siege closer than ever. We ought, therefore, to provide for  ‘‘ our safety and that of our children.’ It was then unanimously agreed to adopt  this last determination, and it soon became public that the officers of the army,  fearing for their lives and those of the inhabitants, had for some time been  treating with the Christians about the surrender of the city. Negotiations then  commenced, and a capitulation was drawn up on the same terms as that of  Guadix, although with some additional articles; as, for instance, that the Pope  should be a guarantee for the faithful execution of the treaty, and the strict  observance of every one of the articles therein contained, before the Christians    Surrenders to  the Castilians.",425,book_8,

The deputies sent by the people of Granada insisted upon the  “insertion of this clause; but it was reported that when they came to discuss  “the article together, the Christians bribed the Moslem envoys, and gave them  “* considerable sums of money, to have it omitted in the capitulation. The treaty  ‘“* was then read over to the inhabitants, who approved of it and gave it their  *‘ sanction, some of the principal citizens signing it with their own hands, and  ‘* pledging their allegiance to the Castilian king, who accepted'it. This done,  “the Sultan of Granada left the Alhambra on the second day of Rabi’ the  “ first, of the year 897 (Jan. 3, a. p. 1492), and the Christian sovereign immediately  “took possession of it, as well as of the other fortresses in Granada, not without  ‘‘ having first received five hundred of the principal inhabitants of Granada as  ‘‘ hostages, to guard against any treachery on the part of the inhabitants.  “The capitulation contained sixty-seven articles, among which were the fol-  “ lowing, viz.: ‘That both great and small should be perfectly secure in their  ‘* persons, families, and properties. That they should be allowed to continue in  ‘their dwellings and residences, whether in the city, the suburbs, or any other  “« part of the country.

That  “no Moslem should be prosecuted for the death of a Christian slain during the  “ siege; and that no restitution of property taken during the war should be  “‘ enforced. That no Moslem should be subject to have Christian soldiers billeted  “‘ upon him, or be transported to provinces of this kingdom against his will. That  ““no increase should be made to the usual imposts, but that, on the contrary,  ‘* all the oppressive taxes lately imposed should be immediately suppressed. That  “no Christian should be allowed to peep over the wall, or into the house of a  “Moslem, or enter a mosque. That any Moslem choosing to travel or reside  “among the Christians should be perfectly secure in his person and property.  “ That no badge or distinctive mark be put on them, as was done with the Jews  “and Mudejares. That no muezzin should be interrupted in the act of calling  “‘ the people to prayer, and no Moslem molested either in the performance of his  “daily devotions or in the observance of his fast, or in any other religious  “ceremony; but that if a Christian should be found laughing at them he should  “ be punished for it.

That the Lord of Rome (Pope) should be requested  “to give his assent to the above conditions, and sign the treaty himself.’ These,  “‘ and many others that we omit, were the articles of the treaty.   “This matter being settled, and the Christians having taken possession of the  “‘ Alhambra, and of the city, the king appointed a governor to that fortress, and  ‘« civil officers and magistrates to govern the inhabitants.

Let all those who read the present letter facilitate    ‘every thing for his passage, and observe towards him the conditions stipulated  “in the treaty.’ Agreeably to the intimation contained in this letter, Abi ’Abdillah  ‘“‘ set forth immediately for Almeria, and having embarked at that port, he sailed  “for the coast of Africa and landed at Melilla.

Things even went so far that in the year 904 (beginning Aug. 18, a.p. 1498),   they set about forcing the Moslems to embrace the Christian religion under   various pretences, the most specious of which was that their priests had written   [books] on the conveniency of compelling such Christians as had become  Moslems to embrace their former religion. Notwithstanding the clamour excited   among the Moslem community by so revolting an injustice, the people being  helpless, the measure was carried into execution. Not satisfied with this breach   ‘‘ of the treaty, the Christian tyrants went still farther; they said to a Moslem,   ‘ Thy ancestor was a Christian, although he made himself a Moslem; thou must   also become a Christian.’ 2   “‘ When these proceedings became public, the people of the Albayzin rose up in   arms and slew their magistrates; but this was also made an excuse for more  rigorous measures, for, soon after, the poor Moslems were told, ‘the king has  promulgated a law by which any one who revolts against his magistrates is  condemned to death, unless he immediately becomes a Christian; so you must   ‘* either die or be converted to Christianity.’   ‘In short, every Moslem, whether residing in Granada or in the neighbourhood, The Moslems  was enjoined to embrace the religion of the idolaters within a certain time.

Some entered the service  “of the Sultan of Maghrebu-l-akss4, who formed them into a body, and allotted  “them for a residence the port of Salé, where they have since made themselves  ‘* famous by their maritime expeditions against the enemy of God; they have also  “* fortified the castle, and built themselves houses, palaces, and baths, and still  ‘continue to reside in that place.

"    TO THE READER.    Since the publication of the first volume of this translation I have had access to new sources  of information, which, as they will be frequently cited in the following Notes, I think it neces-  sary to point out. During a late residence in Oxford I made copious extracts from a volume  (Bodl. Lib., No. cxxxvii.) containing the history of “Abdullah, seventh Sultan of Cordova of  the dynasty of Umeyyah, by the celebrated Abi Merwan Hayyaén Ibn Khalaf Ibn Huseyn  Al-umawi, better known by the surname of Ibnu Hayydn, of whom I gave a short notice in  the Notes to the first volume, p. 310, nofe 3. The volume, which appears to have been the  third in the original set, forms part of the history of Mohammedan Spain, entitled .Al-  muktabis fi tdrtkh rejdli-l-andalus (the imparter of information: on the history of eminent  Andalusians), and it contains the history of Spain from the death of Al-mundhir, in a. H. 275  (a. D. 889), to the accession of *Abdu-r-rahmén III., in a.a. 299 (a.D. 912), a period of  about twenty-four years. By means of extracts from this precious volume I have been  enabled to supply the deficiency to be observed in Al-makkari, whose account of the reign of  *Abdullah is contained in a few lines. It is a volume in quarto, containing fifty-eight folios,  and written in the African character upon coarse brown paper, probably about the middle of  the fifteenth century.   I have also used a volume of the Historical Cyclopedia, entitled Al-’ikd (the necklaces),  by Abi ’Amru Ahmed Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi, a writer of the tenth century,  which, among other learned treatises upon the history of the Arabs both in the East and  West, contains a valuable history of Mohammedan Spain, from the establishment of the race  of Umeyyah till the year 322 (a. p. 934); besides a poem of some length upon the yearly  campaigns of ’Abdu-r-rahman III., the Sultan of that dynasty under whose reign and at  whose court the author lived. It is a large volume in folio, written in the Eastern hand,  in a.H. 1100 (A.D. 1689-90), and forms part of the rich collection of oriental MSS. in the  possession of Nathaniel Bland, Esq., to whom I am indebted for the loan of it.

"    NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.    BOOK V.  CuHapP. I.    ' Mohammedan writers generally give the appellation of as'hib, i. e. ‘ friends or companions,’ to all  those Arabs who were personally acquainted with their Prophet, or who saw him during their lifetime,  and handed down to tradition any of his sayings. The name of ¢dbi’ (follower) is given to those Arabs  who did not see the Prophet, having been born after his death, but who had an opportunity of conversing  with the as'Adb and preserving traditions delivered by them, whether respecting the sayings and doings  of Mohammed, or the dogmas of the religion preached by him. Both the as’Ahdb and the tdbi’s are  divided into tabakdt (orders or classes), according to the age in which they lived.   It is evident, however, that none of the first class, and very few, if any, of the second, could have  entered Spain; since the death of the Prophet happened in a.w. 8 (a. p. 629), and Miisa, in whose  suite most of them are said to have come, did not land in Spain till a.g. 93 (a.p. 712), an interval  of eighty-five lunar or Mohammedan years; but the historians of Spain were not behind those of other  Mohammedan countries in extolling the advantages of their native soil.

I have already alluded (vol. i.  p. 519) to the various meanings of the word mauli, which in its primitive sense implies ‘one who clings  to another for protection,’ ‘an adherent.’ Slaves liberated by their masters became generally maulis.  The old Spanish word “ paniaguado ” (one who partakes of the bread and water of another man) would  seem the most appropriate translation for it; and it is not unlikely that the word maula, meaning in that  language ‘a shrewd man,’ ‘ one who lives by his wits,’ may be derived from it.    6 B. reads Thabit instead of Thakib. The Tekmilah (complement) is an historical work by the  celebrated Ibnu-l-abbér (Abii Bekr Al-kodha’t).    7 Al-muneydhir, whom Conde (vol. i. p. 35) calls ‘ Almonacir,’ is the diminutive of Al-mundhir, and  means ‘the little counsellor.’    8 That is, Yusuf Ibn ’Omar, &c., (see vol. i. pp. 37, 182,) whose Isti’éb fi ma’refati-l-as'hib, or  ‘comprehensive history of the companions,’ is mentioned by H4ji Khalfah (Fluegel’s transl. vol. i.  p. 276).    9 Elsewhere written Al-widheh and Al-wadhéh; the meaning, however, is the same.

In like manner the Arabs of Spain called the 479th  year of the Hijra ’A'mu-l-zaldkah (the year of Zalaca), and the 591st ’A’mu-l-alarkosh (the year of  Alarcos), in commemoration of the two victories gained at those places over the Christians. But there  must be some mistake here; for how could ’Alf Ibn Rabdh be present at a battle fought in a. x. 13,  and be still living in Spain in a.n. 98? In vol. i, p. 536 of this translation, I have called this tdi’  ’Ali Ibn Rabi’, by mistake.    1b spall wold is the name of a station on the northern coast of Africa, between Tripoli and    Alexandria.

Some, like Ibnu Khaldtn, write it ‘Habib Ibn ’Addah;’ others, ‘Habib Ibn ’Obeydah;’  others, again, ‘ Habib Ibn Abi’ Obeydah Ibn ’Okbah ;’ whilst there are not wanting writers, as Al-homaydi,  who call him ‘ Habib Ibn [Abi ’Obeydah] ’Okdah,’—thus making him the son, instead of the grandson,  of the celebrated conqueror of Mauritania.

Mus., No. 7353, fo. 7, verso), the sons of ’Adi, son of Kossay,  son of Keléb, together with other branches of the family of Koraysh, were called Adh-dhawdhir (the  external), because they dwelt out of the precincts of the temple.    5 By the Beni Al-kdsim the author means the family of Abii ’Abdillah Kasim Ibn K4sim, Lord of  Alpont or Alpuente, mentioned in vol. i. p. 171, and p. 449, note 11. The life of a poet, named Abi  Mohammed Ibnu-]-k4sim, who was, no doubt, descended from the same stock, is given in the Mattmah  by Ibn Khak4n (Brit. Mus., No. 9580, fo. 124).    6 No doubt the same author mentioned in vol. i. pp. 37, 171, and p. 334, note 31; since, according to  Al-homaydi (/oco laudato, fo. 118), he wrote a work on the genealogy of the Arabian tribes which settled  in Spain.    7 Our author here transcribes the words of Ibn Ghalib, who, no doubt, introduced a notice of this  traveller under the head of his native place. The clan or family here named the Beni Waksh or Wakash  gave their name to a small town, still called Huecas, in the neighbourhood of Toledo.   Al-makkart gives the life of Ibn Jobeyr in Part I. Book V., among those of the illustrious Moslems who  left Spain to travel in the East. ‘ Abii-l-huseyn Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibn Jobeyr Al-ken4ni Al-andalusi  Ash-shatibi Al-balens{, the author of the celebrated book of travels, was the descendant of Dhamrah Ibn  Bekr Ibn ’Abdi-m-menat su duc of the tribe of Kenénah. He was born at Valencia on the night of  Saturday, the 10th of Rabi’ the first, of 540 (Sept. a.p. 1145). Other dates, however, are assigned  for his birth. He studied at Sh&tibah (Xatiba) under his father Ahmed, and under Abt ’Abdillah  Al-assili (from Arsila), and Abt-l-hasan Ibn Abi-l-’aysh; the latter being his instructor in the science  of reading the Korén. Ibn Jobeyr started from Granada on Thursday, the 8th of Shawwél of 567  (a. p. 1172), and arrived in Alexandria on Saturday, the 29th of Dhi-l-ka’dah of the same year,  after a passage of thirty days from Andalus. He also visited Mekka, Medina, and Al-kods (Jeru-  salem), Syria, ""Irak, Jezirah (Mesopotamia), and other countries. The cause of his leaving Andalus  is thus related by Ibnu-r-rakik. Ibn Jobeyr was the secretary of Abti Sa’id, son of ’Abdu-l-muimen,  governor of Granada. Having once been summoned to his presence to write a letter in his name,  Ibn Jobeyr found Abt Sa’id drinking wine, of which he presented him a cupful; but upon Ibn  Jobeyr refusing to drink the liquor, on the plea that he had never tasted wine before, Abti Sa’id said,  «By God! thou shalt now drink seven bumpers instead of one;”’ upon which Ibn Jobeyr, seeing no  way to avoid the will of the governor, drank the seven glasses of wine, one after the other, as com-  manded, after which the governor filled him the cup seven times with gold din4rs. Ibn Jobeyr then  determined to spend the money he had received upon a pilgrimage to Mekka by way of atonement  for his sin: he therefore told the governor that he had made a vow to muke a pilgrimage that very year,  and Abi Sa’id granted him the permission he required. Ibn Jobeyr returned to Andalus in 581  (a. D. 1185); but, after spending some time in that country, he again sailed for the East, and died  at Alexandria on Wednesday, the 27th of Sha’bin of the year 614 (a.p. 1217). Ibnu-r-rakik says  that he died in the ensuing year (a. H. 615).”",438,,
"    CHAP. 111.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 401    The remainder of Ibn Jobeyr’s biography, which occupies upwards of seventy pages in some of the  copies, is filled with extracts from his travels relating to Damascus and other cities in the East. Al-  makkari, too, takes the opportunity of introducing many long passages from a work of his own, entitled  «sweet odour of the flowers on the history of Damascus.’ See the Account of the Author and his  Writings, vol. i. p. xxxiii.   Ibnu-1-khattib, in his history of Granada, gives also the life of Ibn Jobeyr, with much more detail. One  of his ancestors (’Abdu-s-sellam Ibn Jobeyr) entered Spain in the suite of Balj the Syrian, in the month  of Moharram, 123, and settled at Shidhinah (Sidonia or Ciduefa). He made three journeys to the  East: the Ist in 578 (beginning May 6, a.p. 1182), when he started from Granada on Thursday, the  8th of Shawwé4l, and returned to that city eight days before the end of Moharram, 581] (Aug. 4. D.  1185). When he heard of the taking of Jerusalem by Saladin, he determined upon journeying a second  time to the East, and left Granada on Thursday, the ninth of Rabi’ the first, 585 (April, a. p. 1189),  returning on Thursday, the 13th of Sha’bén, 587 (Sept. a.p. 1191). He passed some time at  Granada, then at Malaga, and, lastly, at Ceuta. On the death of his wife, the daughter of the Wizir  Abi Ja’far Al-wakshi, Ibn Jobeyr, who was much attached to her, determined upon making a third  pilgrimage. On his return from Mekka he settled at Alexandria, where he died. He left, besides    his book of travels, a collection of his own poems, entitled wv! >) w fail} Ard me pe  wr and several others, ° °    8 Midrakah, from daraka, ‘to overtake one in the race,’ means a very swift runner.

H4ji Khalfah (voc. Makdmdt) says that they were  also known by the title of Al-kortobiyah (the sittings of Cordova), because they were written in that city  after the author had perused the celebrated ones by Hariri. As to the title of Al-lazimiyyah, it appears  that they were so called owing to their being written in the kind of poetry called Juzim. Some of the  Makémét of Abt-t-téhir were published at Amsterdam, with a Latin translation, by J.

Having been confirmed in his office by ’Abdullah, the Sultén  of Cordova, Sa’id took the field against ""Omar Ibn Hafsstin (chief of the party of the Muwallads), whom  he defeated in several sanguinary encounters, until he himself fell a victim to treason, and was assassinated  in a.

Ibnu Hayy&n, from whom the above details are borrowed, says that Asbatt,  the great-grandfather of Sa’fd, had been Schibu-sh-shortah, or captain of the guard of Al-hakem I. of  Cordova, and that Sa’fd possessed the ten qualities which ought to grace a chief; namely, horsemanship,  beauty, generosity, facility in writing verses, eloquence, strength, and dexterity in the handling of the  spear and the sword, as well as in shooting arrows.

App. A.    2  16 This distinction between the Beni Modhar yon Ht or Arabs from Yemen, who were descended    from the stock of ’Adndn, and the sons of Kahttén, or Beledi Arabs, as they are otherwise called, has been  completely overlooked by Conde and most of the authors who have written after him. It is, however,  of the greatest importance for the historical observer, as it furnishes him with a clue to those inveterate  feuds, the source of so many civil wars which distracted the Mohammedan empire in Spain, and ultimately  caused its ruin. Conde invariably read yan Ls! (the tribes of Misr or Egypt), instead of yas Jus)  (the tribes issued from Modhar), which, I need not remark, has led his translators into a variety of  mistakes. M. Romey, the author of an excellent history of Spain in French, now in course of pub-  lication, is, as far as I am aware, the only one who seems to have understood all the importance of this  distinction. He was, however, mistaken in supposing that the ’Abd4ris, or Arabs of the tribe of  *Abdu-d-dar, were descended from the stock of Kahtt4n, and were therefore comprised among the Arabs  of Yemen. ’Abdu-d-dér was the son of Zeyd, son of Kelib, the descendant of Modhar, son of Nezar,  son of Ma’d, son of ’Adnén. See Ibn Koteybah, apud Eichhorn, p. 63.    7 Even if the subsequent pages did not afford abundant proofs that the conquerors of Spain lived  in most instances in clans or tribes, the study of Spanish topography would convince us of the truth. The  names of Alfaharin (Fehr), Beniaux (Aus), Beni Calaf (Khalaf), Jorairata (Horayrah), Julina (Khaulén),  Mazan (Mazin), Zalamea (Salimah), and several more towns that I could point out, are all derived  from the tribes or families which settled in them.    18 Ibn Koteybah calls him Nébit. See Eichhorn, Monum. Antig. Hist.

"    404 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book v.    2 *Abdu-l-’aziz was not put to death by the army, but by emissaries of Suleyman. (See App. A. at  the end of this volume.) As to the causes which prompted that Khalif to order his execution, they have  been variously stated; some saying that he made an alliance offensive and defensive with the fugitives of  Galicia; others, that he embraced the Christian religion, and was meditating the massacre of the  Moslems (Adh-dhobf, apud Borbon, Cartas, p. Ixxxii. et seg.); but his having married Roderic’s widow,  his determination to keep the treaty made with Theodomir, the slight and irreverent manner in which he  spoke of his sovereign, when he heard of his father’s treatment, and last, not least, his wish, real or  pretended, to shake off the yoke of the Khalif,—of which we find ample testimony in Isidorus, (Chron.  No. 42,)—were sufficient motives to induce that revengeful monarch to order his death.    3 pole PA «Umm ’A’ssem’ is a common name in the East, and does not mean ‘she of the precious    necklaces,’ as asserted by Conde (vol. i. p. 58). Adh-dhobf and Ibn Habfb say that her Christian  name was | Eyilah. The Spanish chroniclers call her ‘ Egilona.’    4 The text reads Such Sari AP xe wm 9 — the historical fragment published by Casiri  (vol. ii. p. 325) Kut! [% 2] & Be Kin, Suasity—which that author translates by Templo Sal-  vatoris, but which means ‘at the synagogue of the Jews.’ Conde, who met with the same passage,  mistook the words Kertsah Rabbinah (the synagogue of the Rabbis) for the name of the village whereat  *Abdu-l-’aziz was residing (vol. i. p. 62); but that a synagogue, and no other place, is here meant,  is clearly proved by a passage from Adh-dhobi, cited by Borbon (Cartas, p. lxxxii.), wherein it  is expressly stated that ’Abdu-l-’aziz took up his residence in a synagogue Ogal rif ot the    time of the invasion of Spain by the Arabs, the Jews were no longer allowed to profess their religion in  public; but the building wherein ’Abdu-l-’aziz dwelt might have been in former times a synagogue,  or else have been converted into one; since the Jews of Spain are known to have been restored to  all their rights and privileges by the conqueror, in reward for their services at the time of the invasion.    § With the single exception of the anonymous author of a fragment published by Casiri (vol. ii. p. 325),  all other writers whom I have consulted place the death of ’Abdu-l-’aziz in the last days of Dhi-l-  hajjah, a.#. 97. The author of the Ahddithu-l-siydsat wa-l-imdmat (vol. i. App. E. p. xc.), says, it    is true that ’Abdu-l-’aziz was put to death at the end of the year 99; but as the words Feo  (seven) and Fee) (nine) are easily mistaken, and my copy; moreover, is far from being correctly    written, the statement cannot invalidate the testimony of so many other writers: Conde, Hist. de la Dom.  vol. i. p. 63; Borbon, Cartas, p. ci.; Casiri, Bib. Arab. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 324; Al-homaydi, fo. 5, &e.  The duration of his government is likewise generally stated at two years; but if his father, Musa,  left Spain in the month of Dhi-l-hajjah, a.#. 94, as asserted (vol. i. p. 292), the government of  *Abdu-l-’aziz must have lasted three years; and indeed we find it so stated in Isidorus Pacensis  (Chron. No. 42). The difficulty can only be surmounted by supposing Musa to have departed from  Spain in the year 95, instead of 94, as stated in vol. i. p. 292.

"    CHAP. Iv.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 405    7 Some writers do not include Aydb in the number of the Spanish Amirs; no doubt because his  appointment, having emanated from the army, was considered illegal. Others, like Al-hasan Al-laghiw(,  cited by Borbon (Cartas, p. xcvii.), do include him; but they make him succeed Habib Ibn Abi  ’Obeydah, the murderer of ’Abdu-l-’aziz. The author of the Siydsat wa-l-imdmat (App. p. v.) says,  that immediately after the death of ’Abdu-l-’aziz, the army chose ’Abdullah Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén  (lege ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn ’Abdillah] Al-gh4feki to be his successor, and that Habfb and his accomplices  repaired to Damascus. I shall often have to point out in the Notes to this chapter and the following,  how far the historians, whose works are known to us, disagree respecting the chronology of the Spanish  Amirs. Indeed, upon no period of Mohammedan history does there seem to hang so much obscurity  as upon that anterior to the establishment of the race of Umeyyah in Spain. The Arabs were then far  from having attained the historical acquirements by which they became afterwards so celebrated; and  a few verbal traditions are the only records remaining of those early times. With a view, therefore, to  illustrate this part of Al-makkari’s narrative, and to establish, if possible, in a more satisfactory manner  the chronology of this period, I here subjoin a translation of two Arabic fragments, giving the series  of the Spanish Amirs, and the length of their respective reigns; one by ‘Abdu-l-malek Ibn Habfb  (Bodl. Lib., No. exxvii. fo. 143); the other from the Reyhdnu-I-lebdb, a species of Arabic cyclopedia,  of which I possess a copy.    Chronology of the Governors of Andalus according to ' Abdu-l-malek Ibn Habtb.    We were told by ’Abdu-l-malek, who held it from Ibréhim Ibn Al-mundhir Al-hidhémi (Al-jodh&mi ?),  who held it from Al-wékedi. He said: Térik stayed in Andalus one year, counting from the day of his  entrance until he quitted it. After him governed Musa Ibn Nosseyr two years and one month; then  his son ’Abdu-l-’aziz two years; then Al-horr Ibn ‘Abdi-r-rahm4n Ath-thakeff two years and eight  months; then As-samh Ibn Milik Al-khaulini two years and nine months; then ’Anbasah Ibn Sohaym  Al-kelbi four years and five months; then Yahya Ibn Salémah (Salmah ?] two years and six months;  then Hodhayfah Ibnu-l-ahwass Al-’absi was governor one year; then ’Othmén Ibn Ab{ Nes’ah Al-  khath’ami five months; then Al-haytham Ibn ’Obeyd four months. After him governed ’Abdu-r-rahmén  Ibn ’Obeydillah two years and eight months; then ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Kattan Al-fehri four years; then  ’Okbah Ibnu-l-hej4j As-selili five years and two months; then Balh (Balj) Ibn Beshr Al-kays{ eleven  months; then governed after him, some say conjointly with him, Tha’lebah Ibn Salémah Al-’4meli  five months; then came the rising of ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Habfb, of Umeyyah, and Kattan, and of  Ydsuf, with their followers, who, having joined their forces, attacked Balh, defeated and wounded him ;  and he (Balh) died seven days after the battle. After this Abi-l-khattér governed two years; then  [Abu] Thudbah Al-hidh&émi [Al-jodh4mi] governed one year; then Yusuf Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén seven  (or nine] years and nine months, until ’Abdu-r-rahm4n landed and took the country from him.    The same, according to the Reyh&nu-]-leb4b wa rey’4nu-sh-sheb4b fi maratibi-l-adab, by Mohammed Ibn  Ibrdhim.    After the death of ’Abdu-l-’aziz, Al-horr Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Al-kaysi governed Andalus for two  years and three months. After him As-samh Ibn Malik Al-khaulén{ governed two years and nine  months; then ’Anbasah Ibn Sohaym Al-kelb{ governed four years and five months; then Yahya Ibn    Moslemah i. (Jege Salmah) two years and six months; then Hodheyfah Ibnu-l-ahwas Al-kaysi one  year; then ’Othmén Ibn Sa’d aw (Jege Nes’ah) Al-khath’ami five months; then Al-haytham Ibn",443,,

Castile (Castella) was at that time called  * Bardulia.’    9 If Al-horr arrived in Andalus at the end of 98, the government ad interim of Aydb Ibn Habib  must have lasted one whole year, not six months, as here stated. An author cited by Borbon (Cartas,  p. c.) says distinctly, that ‘‘ Ayib governed Spain from the death of ’Abdu-l-’aziz in Dhi-1-hajjah of 97,  to the same month of 98, when he himself was deposed by Al-horr; and that the appointment of Ayub  proceeded from the army, not from the Khalif.”” This explains why the anonymous writer translated by  Casiri (vol. ii. p. 325), and followed by Conde (vol. i. p. 64), says that Spain remained one year without  a governor, which must be understood to mean without a governor appointed by the Khallif.    10 The account of Ibnu Hayy4n is the most probable, as it agrees with the duration of Al-horr’s  administration. As-samh or As-samah is the Zama of Isidorus Pacensis, who, by some unaccountable  mistake, makes two governors out of one. See also Rodericus Toletanus (Hist. Arab. cap. xi.), who fell  into the same mistake, calling the first Zama and the second ‘ Azam[ah] ben Melich.’    Nt See vol. i. p. 212, where the author attributes the erection of the bridge either to As-samh, in  a.H. 101, or to his successor ’Abdu-r-rahmfn Al-ghéfeki. Rodericus Toletanus (Hist. Arab. cap. xi.)  says that it was built by the former in a.#. 102; but in all probability it was begun under As-samh,  and completed under ’Abdu-r-rahmén. Conde (vol. i. p. 75) attributes its erection, or rather its  restoration, to ’Anbasah.    12 The text reads Epic us (= Udall vs! ew UN wl 8 yo) 7—Tbnu Khaldin has only  sil us,! Uae wy! —Conde (vol. i. p. 75) translated Ahamasa by ‘ divided into five portions,’  a signification of which that word may admit; but which, in this instance, cannot with propriety be given  to it. The districts which still remained in the hands of the Christians were too inconsiderable to be  divided into five portions, much less to be worthy of a description. What Omar wanted was a descriptive  account of Spain, as well as the fifth of the spoil, or of the taxes levied on the Christian population,  which belonged to him by right. See Isidorus Pacensis, Chron. No. 48.    13 Tbnu Hayy4n wrote after the overthrow of the dynasty of Umeyyah, and when the conquests of  Ferdinand III. of Castile and Ramiro I. of Aragon were daily narrowing the limits of the Mohammedan  empire.    4 The word \% baldtt, which seems a corruption of ‘ platea,’ means here the Roman causeway, near  Toulouse, in the vicinity of which the battle was fought.

It is the 8th day of Dhi-]-hajjah, not the 9th, as erroneously stated by  Conde (vol. i. p. 72), and answers to May 10, a. p. 721, which date agrees well with the accounts of the  Christian chroniclers, who place the battle of Toulouse in 721. Among the Arabs, however, there are  many who postpone the battle till the ensuing year. Besides Conde (vol. i. p. 72) and Adh-dhobi, apud  Casiri (vol. ii. p. 137), there is Al-azdi (Ahmed Ibn Ahmed), cited by Borbon (Cartas, p. cxxix.),  who says positively that As-samh was killed on the 18th of Dhi-l-hajjah, a. a. 103 (A.D. 722). That  author adds that As-samh was slain in Asturias, not in France, fighting with Pelayo. Another writer  (Mohammed Abt ’Abdillah Al-hijéri) corroborates that statement, and says that the death of As-samh    took place in the neighbourhood of Leon, in an engagement with the Asturian prince — , i] Js 5  ush po xd) A wy Use us    Don Faustino Borbon has devoted a whole letter (Carta xv1.) to prove that As-samh died in Spain in  A. a. 103, in battle with Pelayo, not in France at the battle of Toulouse, as generally believed. It  would, indeed, appear from the quotations which that author inserts in his work, that As-samh invaded  France, took Narbonne, advanced as far as Toulouse, and fought the battle, which he lost, and in which    he was wounded 4.2 eel ws 3 (another writer says cP ay eo os ey y ‘in which  he was near being killed, for he was wounded’). As-samh then returned into Spain, and, hearing  that Pelayo had besieged Leon, marched against him, and fought with him the battle in which he  was slain. Be this as it may, if As-samh was appointed in Ramadhan, a.#. 100, and his death took  place in Dhi-]-hajjah, 102, his administration could not have lasted more than two years and three  months,—not eight months, as here stated.    16 Instead of 30, one of the copies reads 300. The rising of Pelayo, howéver, took place some years  before, during the administration of Al-horr, in a.#. 99 (A.D. 717-8). That governor, being then  occupied in a war with the Franks, sent one of his lieutenants, named Kale ’Alkamah (the Alxaman  of Rodericus), against the Asturian rebels; but the Moslems were defeated, and their general slain.  “In the year 99, Al-horr,” says Adh-dhobi (fo. 17), ‘‘ having heard of the rising of the Christians [in    “ Asturias], sent against them his general, ’Alkamah, who was [defeated and] killed.” su AP r)    Kale a 3 Re roe wu)! 3 eos! re = pe 44—This date, moreover, agrees better with    those given by the Christian chroniclers for the rising of Pelayo: ‘‘ Antequam Dominus Pelagius regnaret,  “« Sarraceni regnarunt in Hispania annis quinque.” See Cronicon Complutense necnon Chronicon Conim-  bricense, apud Florez, Esp.

According to Conde (vol. i. p. 78),  *Anbasah died of his wounds, some days after the battle. All, however, agree as to the year of his  death (a.

How to reconcile these dates with those given by Al-makkarf after  Ibnu Bashkiwél and Ibnu Khaldun, it is by no means easy to determine.   As to the difference in the duration of Yahya’s rule, which some writers, as Ibnu Khaldiin (Joco laudato,  fo. 2, verso) and Ibn Habfb (see nofe 7, p. 405), calculate at two years and a half; and others, like  the anonymous historian translated by Casiri (vol. ii. p. 326), at one and a half; it may easily be  accounted for by the fact, that during Yahya’s administration the Berbers, commanded by one ’Othmén  Ibn Abf ’Abdah or Abi ’Obeydah, of whom mention will be made hereafter, took possession of Cordova,  and deposed the governor. ‘Othmén himself remained in power until Hodheyfah dispossessed him.  Borbon, Cartas, p. cxlviii.    21 The next governor was not ‘Othman Ibn Abi Nes’ah, as here stated. Al-makkari was led into  error by Ibnu Khaldin: there were two governors of Andalus of the same name; one, ’Othmdn Ibn Abi  Nes’ah Al-khath’am{, whom Casiri (vol. ii. p. 326) calls Al-johanf, i. e. of the tribe of Johaynah; and  the other, ’Othmdn Ibn Abi ’Abdah or ’Obeydah Al-korash{, who signed the capitulation with Theodomir.  Isidorus Pacensis (Cron. No. 57) is very explicit: ‘‘ Hic (Antuman) [sed lege Autuman] ab Africanis  “ partibus tacitus properat. Hic quinque mensibus Hispanjas gubernavit: post quos vitam finivit, et  “* missus est alius Autuman nomine.”   The period which elapsed between the nomination of Yahya, in Shawwal, a.#. 107, and the arrival of  Al-haytham, in Moharram, a.H. 111, that is, three years and about three months, is designated by  Al-azdi under the appellation of Iydmu-I-fitnah (the days of confusion or civil war). According to  another historian, cited by Borbon (Cartas, p. cliii.), Vis Vigh pie pee Vyuis Qubal , zip  ‘the Berbers and the [Arabian tribes] slaughtered each other.’ The Arabs themselves were divided,  and the two hostile factions of the Yemenites and Modharites fought likewise for the supreme power.  This explains why there should be so much discrepancy in the dates assigned for the administration  of the four governors who ruled in the short space of three years. Supposing, however, that Yahya’s  administration lasted eighteen months, from Shawwél, 107, to Rabi’ 1. 108,—that ""Othman Ibn Abi  ’Abdah usurped the power and ruled until the arrival of ’Othmén Ibn Abi Nes’ah, in Sha’bén, 109,  not 110, as in the text, which would give him the five months’ administration mentioned by Isidorus,—  that his successor ’Othmén Ibn Ab{ Nes’ah ruled six months, till the arrival of Hodheyfah in Rabi’ the Ist,  a. 8. 110, and that the administration of the latter lasted eleven months, until the arrival of Al-haytham  in Moharram, a.H. 111,—the chronology of this very intricate period of Spanish history would be  satisfactorily adjusted. as",446,,

He was sent by the Viceroy  of Africa, ‘Obeydullah Ibn Al-hajéb (not Al-hejaj, as Conde, vol: i. p. 90, calls him), to supersede  *Abdu-l-malek, of whose tyranny and excesses he had received formal complaints. ’Abdu-l-malek was  absent from Cordova, making war on the Franks, when ’Okbah, accompanied by ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn  Habib, landed in Spain, and seized on the capital (Borbon, p. clxix.). On his return to Cordova,  ’Abdu-]-malek was imprisoned and deprived of his command. He contrived, however, to escape and  take refuge in Barcelona, where it appears that he had numerous partisans. ’Okbah marched against  him; but having received intelligence, whilst at Saragossa, of the revolt of the Berbers in Africa, he  crossed over to that country and relinquished his enterprise. We are not told whom ’Okbah left to  command in Spain during his absence, at what time he departed for Africa, and when he returned ;  but ’Abdu-l-malek again got possession of the government; and in the year 121, according to Ibnu  Khaldin, or in the beginning of 123, according to Ar-rézi, he either exiled or put to death his antagonist.    31 Adh-dhob{, quoted by Borbon (Cartas, p. clxxi.), agrees with Ar-razi in placing the death of  ’Okbah in 123; but he makes him die at Cordova, not at Carcasonne, and adds that he was poisoned    by ""Abdu-l-malek Rb 5 kway pully Rude [EW uc] bs ,—Conde (vol. i. p. 96) says that    he died in 124; but little or no reliance can be placed on the statements of a writer who never gives  his authority, and whose translations are not always faithful. According to his account, ’Okbah landed  in Spain in 118, left it for Africa in 120, and returned in 124. Not a word is said of the revolt of  ’Abdu-l-malek, who is represented as being upon the best terms with ’Okbah.         CHAPTER V.    1 Soon after the conquest of Spain, the Berbers who served under the banners of the Arabs, and most  of whom, though nominally converted to Islim, still professed the Jewish religion or adhered to the rites  of paganism, made several attempts to shake off the yoke of the Arabs. In a.#. 99, under the adminis-  tration of Al-horr, a Berber, named Khaulén Al-yahiidi (the Jew), rose in arms against the Arabs, and  maintained himself in Aragon and Catalonia until he was defeated and put to death in a. H. 100 (Borbon,  Carta xiv. et seg.). Again, a.u. 107, during the administration of Yahya Ibn Salmah, the Berbers  of Spain rose against their masters, and aimed at their total expulsion from that country, saying,  “« We conquered Andalus, took its cities, and subdued its provinces; we fought against the Riim and  “against the Frank; ours therefore is the country, and ours the spoil, not yours;” (Borbon, loco  laudato, p. cxlix.). It was only through the union of the two hostile factions, the Modharites and the  Yemenites, that Yahya was at last enabled to put down the rebellion.    2 Conde (vol. i. p. 97) says that Kolthim died in the action; so does Isidorus Pacensis (Cronic.         ",448,,
"    CHAP. V.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 411    No. 64), as well as An-nuwayri (Journal Asiatique, tom. xi. p. 446). The last-named writer calls the  chief of the Berber insurrection Meysar Al-matghari.  The name of Kolthtim’s successor, Hondhalah, may also be written ‘Handhalah.’ Ibn Habib (/oco    ree    laudato, fo. 9, verso) writes it dais Hantalah.    3 According to Conde, who makes no mention of the siege of Ceuta by the Berbers, Balj with other  Syrians crossed over to Andalus immediately after their defeat. The whole, however, is explained by  Isidorus Pacensis, whose chronicle abounds with interesting details on the history of this period. See  Cronic. No. 64, et seq.    4 This is no doubt the Zat (Zeyyéd) Sarracenus of Isidorus Pacensis, who attributes to ""Othman Ibn  Abi Nes’ah what is here recorded of ’Abdu-l-malek.   5 No details of this rebellion are to be found either in Conde or Borbon; but the author of the  Tktifé fi akhbdri-l-kholafé (Arab. MS. in my possession) says that the chief of the Berbers on this  occasion was Ibn Yeferen Az-zenati, who, having revolted a second time under the administration of  Husém Ibn Dhirér Al-kelbi, was taken prisoner in a battle and conveyed to Cordova, where he was    s  nailed to a stake wre with a dog at his right hand, a swine at his left, a lizard in front, and an ape  behind ; all which animals are considered unclean by the Arabs.    6 From the arrival of ’Abdu-l-malek, in Ramadhan, a.u. 114, to his execution, in Dhi-l-ka’dah,  123, is an interval of nine years, which is the aggregate amount of the administrations of ""Okbah and  *Abdu-l-malek, namely, five years the former and four the latter. Ar-r4zi, it is true, says that ’Okbah  ruled the country for six years and four months; but in so doing it is evident that he only counts  ’Abdu-l-malek’s second administration, from the death of his rival ’Okbah, in Safar, 123, to his execution  in Dh{-1-ka’dah of the same year.    7 One of the copies reads cp seventy, instead of es ninety.    § All the copies read here ile! Al-hidrrah except the abridgment, which has § = Al-harrah ; but    I think that § el Al-hirah, which means ‘the street,’ is to be substituted. The battle was so called    because it was fought at Medina, in the quarter of the city called Al-hdrah Bent Zohrah, or ‘the street  of the Benf Zohrah,’ between the Syrians, commanded by Moslem Ibn ’Okbah, and the inhabitants  of that city, who had revolted against the Khalif Yezid.

[BooK v.    1 Beladitin (i. e. the people of cities) is the name which the Yemenites or Arabs of the stock of  Kahtt4n gave to their rivals of the stock of ’Adnén; the Syrians who entered Spain with Balj being all  Modharites, were descended from the stock of ’Adn&n.    12 ""Abdu-r-rahmén was the son of that ’Alkamah (Alxaman) who was killed in battle with Pelayo.

Indeed, the whole of that chapter of his  work which treats of the civil war between Balj and Ibn Kattan is a tissue of errors and contradictions.  Of Umeyyah and Kattan, the two sons of the unfortunate ’Abdu-l-malek, he makes only one person,  whom he calls Omeya ben Cotan, el hijo de Abdelmelic; he confounds ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Habib with  *Abdu-r-rahm4én Ibn ’Okbalr; and, lastly, he attributes to the latter the exploit here recounted as  achieved by ’Abdu-r-rahmaén Ibn ’Alkamah. Thus all those writers who have followed Conde in this  part of his narrative, Romey not excepted (vol. iii. p. 129), have involuntarily been led into error.

See on this subject the sensible observations of M. Reinaud, Invas.  des Sarras. p. 28.    18 For a long time after the conquest of Spain the Berbers continued to lead a nomadic life, shifting  their quarters from one end of the peninsula to the other, and taking their wives and children with them  even when engaged in military expeditions. Ibnu-l-abbér (Nat. Lib. Madrid, fo. 127) says that ’Abdu-r-  rahmfn I. of Cordova was the first who conquered their roving habits, made them build villages and  towns, and subjected them to a more sedentary life.    19 Evidently the same ‘Othman who had been governor of Spain on a former occasion, (see p. 36,)  although Conde (vol. i. p. 84) and other writers after him identify him with the Munniz of Isidorus  Pacensis (Cron. No. 58), who was put to death by ’Abdu-r-rahm4n Al-ghéfeki.    2 If we adopt the date given by Ibnu Hayy4n, Tha’lebah had governed the country for about ten  months, counting from the death of Balj, in Shaww4l, 124.

On  the other hand, from the death of Balj in Shawwél, 124, to the appointment of Yusuf in Rabi’ the  second, 129, there is only an interval of four years and three months; and yet Abi-l-khattér is  said to have governed four years and nine months; Tha’lebah ten months (or, according to others, two  years), and Thudbah one year (others say two). We have, besides, to make some allowance for a  short interregnum, as well as for the whole year during which the Beni Modhar ruled the country  after a previous agreement with the Yemenites.

(Borbon, Cartas, p. clxxxix.)  This obstacle once removed, the duration of their respective governments may be thus adjusted:  Tha'lebah ten months, from the death of Balj in Shaww4l, 124, to the arrival in Cordova of Abi-l-  khattér, in Rejeb, 125; Abu-l-khattér two years, till the rising of Thudbah, in Rejeb, 127; Thudbah  sixteen months, till his death at the end of 128; and five months of civil war and anarchy, till the death  of Abi-l-khattar and the election of Yusuf, in Rabi’ the second, 129.    38 Tbnu Khaldim is the only historian who mentions this fact.

An-nuwayri  (loco laudato, fo. 441) gives the following account of the latter: ‘‘ His name was las Shakié Ibn ’Abdi-1-  “« wahed. He was a Berber of the tribe of Mekndsah. He could read the Korén and write, owing to  “ which accomplishments he exercised the functions of schoolmaster to his tribe.

He rose at & 2) tens Santiberia  “ (not Santamaria, as in the text,) in the year 151 (a.p. 768), and was joined by great numbers of his  “tribe. He maintained himself until 160, when two of his followers, named Abi Ma’n and Abii Kharim,  “« put him to death, and conveyed his head to ’Abdu-r-rahm4n.”    16 Ure ey woe — Thus in all the manuscripts except the abridgment, which reads § he Hayét  or Haywah. An-nuwayri calls him Ibn Mulémis; and Conde (vol. i. p. 178) ‘‘ Hayat Ibn Molemis.”  The latter author, however, makes him die before, in 143, in great favour with ’Abdu-r-rahmén. He is  the individual mentioned at p. 18, and note 14, p. 399.    7 According to An-nuwayri, the execution of Abri-s-sabéh took place in 149 (a.p. 766). ‘‘ In this  “year (a.H. 149) ’Abdu-r-rahm4n deposed Abti-s-sabéh from the government of Seville.

Al-huseyn detached a  “ portion of his forces, under the command of his son ‘Isa, to attack ’Abdu-r-rahm4n; but ‘Isa was  “defeated, and his army destroyed. Tem4m Ibn ’Alkamah [the father of Ghalib] then besieged  «« Al-huseyn in Saragossa; but without success. The ensuing year, a. H. 166 (beginning Aug. 14, 782),  “«*Abdu-r-rahmén, in person, came to the siege of Saragossa, bringing with him six-and-thirty manjanik  “‘ or war-engines to batter the walls with.

Having put himself at their head, he marched to Seville, which he reduced, his forces being  “greatly increased by the partisans [he had there]. At the news of this revolt, ’Abdu-r-rahmén    “hastened (towards Seville]. Sa’id shut himself up in a castle called oe! |, Raghtk, and fortified    “himself in it: this happened on the 11th of Rabi-l-awal (June, a.p. 765). Sa’fd was immediately  “‘ besieged by ’Abdu-r-rahmén, who invested the castle on every side, and prevented other rebels from  ‘‘ joining him. Among the chiefs who on this occasion made common cause with Sa’id Al-yahssobf,  “was ’Alkanah Al-lakhmi, who, having collected at Shidinah the chiefs of certain tribes, was preparing  “to march to the assistance of Sa’id. But ’Abdu-r-rahm4n, having received intelligence of their  “movement in time, detached a division of his army under the command of his mauli Bedr, who  “interposed himself between the castle [of Raghiik] and the enemy, and kept him at bay. The siege,  ‘‘ meanwhile, was prosecuted with vigour, until Sa’id, seeing the number of his followers daily diminished  “‘ by death and desertion, made a sally, and was killed, &c.   “« After the death of Sa’id, a lieutenant of his named Merwdn was appointed by the rebels to succeed  “him: the siege continued with increased vigour, until [some of] the garrison offered to ’Abdu-r-  “‘ rahmén to make him master of the castle and of the person of Merwén, if he would only spare their  “lives. 'Abdu-r-rahm4n consented, and Merw4n was apprehended and put to death with numbers  “* of his followers. This being done, ’Abdu-r-rahmdn marched against Ghiy4th Al-azdi, one of the chiefs  “ who had assisted Sa’fd in his revolt.

If we place his accession in Juméda  the first, a.H. 172, which is the date given by Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi (note 36, p. 424), his reign lasted  seven years and eight months.    13 Saken or Sakn Ibn Ibrahim was one of the historians of Mohammedan Spain. Ibnu Hayyén quotes  him frequently in his history of the Beni Umeyyah, fo. 2, 6, et passim.    4 According to Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi, the accession of Al-hakem took place on the 14th day of Safar,  A. a. 180 (April 28, a. p. 796). Al-homaydi, cited by Casiri (vol. ii. p. 199), says on the 16th.    18 These were Suleyman and Abdullah, who had already disputed the throne with his father Hishim.  Defeated in several encounters by their brother, they had been compelled to accept the terms offered to  them. Suleym4n crossed over to Africa, and settled at Tangiers; ‘Abdullah was allowed to reside  in Toledo. Compare Conde, vol. i. p. 232, and Casiri, Bib. Arab, Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 33.    16 This was not the first invasion of the Franks under this reign.

An-nuwayri, under the year 185, mentions the taking of Barcelona by the Franks; but nowhere does he  say that they had previously taken Narbonne, and that Al-hakem retook it. Under the year 186 he    records the loss of Tuteylah [Tudela], which, he says, was taken by the Franks, assisted by a rebellious  governor of those districts, [Bahlal Ibn Marzvik ?].    7 The author of the Jktifé says his brother, Al-mundhir; Conde (vol. i. p. 245), his cousin, Casim  (K4sim), who, he adds, was the first to disclose to Al-hakem the plans of the conspirators, An-nuwayri  (loco laudato, p. 451) calls him Mohammed Ibn Al-késim Al-merwini, and says that he not only informed  Al-hakem of the conspiracy against his life and throne, but had spies of that Sultan concealed about the  house, that they might hear and report to Al-hakem the intentions and designs of the conspirators, and  take their names as they went into the house.    18 According to other authorities the revolt took place in the suburb of Shakandah or Secunda, which  adjoined the capital on the southern or south-eastern extremity. See vol. i. p. 206. The author of the  Reyhdnu-I-lebiib says in the southern suburb, contiguous to that of Secunda, on the opposite (or left) bank  of the Guadalquivir.    19 Al-makrizi, in his history of Egypt, records the arrival of the Andalusians in Alexandria and the  disturbances which they caused there until they were banished the country. See M. Quatremére’s  translation of that historian, art. Alexandrie, fo. 94.    20 It was not the Franks, but the Greeks under Armetas, son of Constantine, who retook the island of  Crete in a. pv. 961.

He was  defeated by the troops of his nephew, and compelled to retire to Merida, where he was overtaken, made  prisoner, and conveyed to Al-hakem, who put him to death and sent his head to Cordova.    % All the copies I have consulted read here B yuo Tarastinah, a corruption of Turiaso or Turiasone,  bat this can hardly be the place meant.

Compare Conde, vol. i. p. 247, and Cardonne, vol. i. p. 122.

"    428 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book vr.    25 The rebellion of the Toledans under this reign is so slightly mentioned by Al-makkari, and so  inaccurately described in Conde (vol. i. p. 279), that I think it necessary to supply the deficiency with  the text of An-nuwayri.   “In the year 219,” says that historian, ‘‘’Abdu-r-rahm4n sent his son Umeyyah against Toledo,  “‘ whose inhabitants had revolted some time before. Umeyyah marched thither at the head of con-  “siderable forces and besieged the city; he cut down the trees, destroyed the crops, and laid waste  “* every thing in the neighbourhood. Still the people of Toledo persevered in their rebellion; Umeyyah,  “ however, being unable to reduce the city, raised his camp and returned (to Cordova], leaving a portion  “‘ of his forces at Kalét Rabéh (Calatrava) under the command of an officer named Meysarah, better  “‘ known by his surname of Fata Abt Aydb (the page of Abi Ayib). The people of Toledo, hearing  “ of ‘Abdu-r-rahmén’s retreat, left the city in large numbers and marched against Meysarah, thinking  ‘that they would find him unprepared, and might gain some advantage over him. The contrary,  “‘ however, happened; for Meysarah, having received intelligence of their movements, prepared to receive  “them. Having laid in ambush for them on the road to Calatrava, he attacked them, threw them into  ‘‘ confusion, and made incredible slaughter in their ranks; some few only of their number succeeded  “‘in reaching Toledo. The heads of the slain were then collected and carried before Meysarah, who,  “* seeing them in such numbers, was seized with horror; melancholy lodged in his heart, and he died a  “* few days after.   “In the year 220 ’Abdu-r-rahmén sent another army (against Toledo]. The Sultén’s troops fought  “* frequently with the inhabitants, but gained no decisive advantage over them. In 221, in consequence  “of the siege of Calatrava by the rebels of Toledo, all the Sultén’s forces assembled and besieged  “‘ that city, which they kept closely invested until the year 222, when ’Abdu-r-rahmén sent his own  “brother Al-walid, son of Al-hakem, to take the command of the besieging army. The defenders of  “ Toledo had been so reduced in numbers by the sword, and the privations consequent on so long a  “siege, that Al-walid had no difficulty in gaining possession of the city, which he took by storm on  “ Saturday, the 8th of Rejeb of the same year. Al-walid ordered the restoration of a strong tower  “‘ which defended the entrance of the bridge, and which had been destroyed by the command of Al-  “‘hakem; and after staying in Toledo until the end of Sha’bén of the year 223, to provide for the  “ government of the place, he returned to Cordova,”    36 An-nuwayri gives some interesting details on this campaign, which is also mentioned by Conde,  vol. i. p. 247, ‘In the year 200,” he says, ‘ Al-hakem sent out an army against the Franks. The  ‘* Moslems were commanded by ’Abdu-l-kerim, who marched into the very heart of the [Christian]  “ territory, plundering and laying waste the country, demolishing numbers of their castles, and appro-  “ priating to himself the treasures of their owners [or feudal lords]. However, when the Christian king  ‘* saw what was passing [in his dominions], he wrote to all the kings [or feudal lords] of those districts  * to come to his help, which they did, hastening to his assistance with all their forces from every part of  “ the Christian world. Thus re-inforced, the Christian king went out to meet the Moslems, and encamped  “ opposite to them on the bank of a river which separated the two hosts. After some days spent in  “ skirmishing, the Moslems wishing to cross the river and the Christians preventing them, ’Abdu-]-kerim  “‘ removed his camp to some distance from the river; upon which the Christians crossed it, and a battle  ‘* ensued in which the infidels were defeated with great loss, and compelled to fall back upon the river,  “against which they were so pressed by the Moslems that few of them escaped captivity or the  “ sword; the greater part of their [feudal] lords, officers, and counts remaining prisoners in the hands of  “ the faithful.

His father was  called Al-balensi, or the Valencian, because during his contention for the throne with his brother  (Hisham] and nephew [Al-hakem], he had always been favourably received by the inhabitants of that  city, who defended his cause to the last. An-nuwayri describes thus the events here alluded to.   “Tp the year 224 ’Abdu-r-rahman dispatched an army to the enemy’s country under the command of  “*Obeydullah, son of ’Abdullah Al-balensi, who reached Alava and the (land of the] castles and met the  “infidels, when, after much hard fighting and great slaughter, the Christians were defeated; such  “‘ numbers of them being slain that when their heads were piled up in the field of battle a horseman    ** could not see his comrade.”  *Obeydullah had been twelve years before in command of an expedition to the land of the Franks  (Catalonia ?), from which he likewise returned victorious.    2 This Fortin Ibn Masa and his brother Musa Ibn Miisa, mentioned lower down, belonged to the  powerful family of the Tojibites, who had extensive domains in the Thagher (Aragon).

Being anxious  to revenge the defeat which his arms had sustained, ’Abdu-r-rahman sent his own son Mohammed at the  head of considerable forces. Mohammed besieged Musa in Tudela, and compelled him to sue for peace.  He then directed his arms against Pamplona, defeated the Christians, and killed their king, Garcia.  An-nuwayri, loco laudato, fo. 460.   M. Romey, after Conde, has erroneously placed these events in the reign of Mohammed; he has also  laboured to identify the Muza Ben Zeyad E] Gedai of Conde (vol. i. p. 288) with the Musa Ibn Misa  mentioned in this passage. In this, as in many other instances, the French writer, notwithstanding his  extensive reading and sound criticism, has been led into error by the Spanish translator.    ® The Arabs give the name of Majiis indifferently to all the nations inhabiting the northern parts of  Europe.    ® Mehriyyah is the name for a camel of a very fine breed which is mostly to be found in Africa.    7M. Romey (vol. iii. p. 434) says that Al-ghuzzdl means ‘the composer of gazelles,’ and that Yahya  was so called because he excelled in that species of poetry. Such, however, is not the fact. Yahya was  so called owing to his personal beauty; it is so stated by Al-makkari, Part I. book v. fo. 181, verso,  where he gives the life of that individual.    § An-nuwayri furnishes us with some interesting details respecting these people.   «In the year 230 the Majtis went out of the remote districts of Andalus against the territory. of the  “Moslems. They first showed themselves at Lisbon in Dhi-l-hajjah of the year 229 (Aug. or Sept.  ‘‘a.p. 844). After remaining in that city for about thirteen days, during which time they had many    “* severe battles with the Moslems, they marched to ue 3 K4yis (perhaps ol Cadiz), and thence to    “ Kydd Shidtinah, where they fought a great battle with the Moslems. From thence they advanced  “against Seville, where they arrived on the 8th of Moharram (Sept. 24, a.p. 844), and encamped  “at twelve parasangs from that city. Four days after, on the 12th of Moharram (Sept. 28), the  “* Moslems went out against them; but they were defeated with great slaughter. The Majiis then came  *« closer to the city, and encamped at the distance of two miles from it. Again did the citizens of Seville  “go out to fight the enemy, but they were a second time defeated with great loss in killed and  ‘* prisoners, and the sword of the Majiis was not lifted either from man or beast until they actually  “ gained possession of the city. This last defeat happened on the 14th day of Moharram (Sept. 30).  «« After staying in Seville one day and one night, the Majtis departed to their ships.   “‘ Meanwhile the troops of the Sultan were marching against them, which being known by the Majis,  “they went forward to meet them, and a bloody conflict ensued; but the Moslems having summoned up",469,,

Soon  “‘ after another body of troops, sent by the Amir ’Abdu-r-rahm4n, made its appearance in the same  “* districts, upon which the Majiis [left their ships and] attacked them with great fury, and obliged them  “‘to retreat. The Moslems, however, returned to the attack, and on the 2nd of Rabi’ the first  “ (Nov. 16, a. p. 844) fought with them a second time. Provisions came in from every district, and  “the army was swelled by volunteers; the Majis were attacked and defeated with the loss of about five  “hundred men, and four of their vessels, which, after being emptied of all their valuables, were set  “ on fire.   “The Majis then went to 4...)

There can be no doubt, however, that  the individual here mentioned was no other than Garseanus or Garcia, surnamed Enecho (Inigo) and  Arista, “Apioros, who about that time revolted against his liege lord Ordofo I., son of Ramiro (not of  Alfonso, as in the text), and proclaimed himself independent, in conjunction with Misa Ibn Misa, whose _  daughter he is said to have espoused (Sebast. Salmant. Chron. No. 26). Yet, as this same Garseanus,  whom Rodericus Toletanus (lib. v. cap. 21) calls Enecho, is said to have been slain in the battle of  Albelda (a corruption of Léa! Albeydh4) or Clavijo some years before, he cannot be the sovereign  intended.    7 Tt is not quite clear that Alfonso III. of Leon was the king here designated under the general  appellation of Ludherik. His father and predecessor, Ordono, was still living in 865.  PP P is    38 Conde (vol. i. p. 302) places about this time a maritime expedition which left Cordova for the coast  of Galicia.

The following are the words of the latter historian. ‘‘ In the year 246 (beginning March 27, a. p. 860)  «« Mohammed ordered the building of several vessels at Cordova. After descending the river to Seville  “they entered the ocean, and sailed for the shores of Galicia; but a storm at sea scattered them, and  “« scarcely two of their number returned.”    3 No account of this rebellion is to be found in my copy of An-nuwayri, which, like its original in the  library of Leyden, wants a few pages; but that author records several other insurrections of the people of  Merida, the most formidable of which happened in 213, under the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahmén. “‘ In the  “« year 213 the people of Merida put to death their governor, and civil war broke out among them. At  “ the news of their revolt, ’Abdu-r-rahm4n sent against them an army which besieged that city, destroyed  ‘* their plantations, and cut down the [fruit] trees, until they were compelled to return to their obedience  “and give the Sultén hostages for their future good behaviour. The army then left them, after pulling  «« down the city walls. In order, however, to prevent any further resistance on their part, and from fear  “they should be tempted to repair the fortifications, ’Abdu-r-rahman directed his officers to have the  «stones thrown into the river; but when the people of Merida saw this, they returned to rebellion,  “ seized on their governor, and repaired the city walls, which they made even stronger than before. In  “the year 214, ’Abdu-r-rahmén dispatched another army to Merida with the hostages given by the  “ inhabitants; but, although the city was closely invested by the royal troops, they could not reduce it.  “« At last, in the year 218, ’Abdu-r-rahmaén sent a third army, which took the city, although the principal  “ actors in the rebellion had time to escape. In their number was a man named Mahmiid Ibn ’Abdi-1-  “* jabbaér Al-m4ridi (a native of Merida), who fled with numbers of the inhabitants to a castle called  @ byte Monsalut, and from thence deserted to Galicia, &c.”   An-nuwayri goes on to relate how Mahmiid, who is no other than the Mahzmuth of Sebastianus  Salmanticensis (Chron. No. 22), having taken a castle, called Santa-Chrietina, which belonged to  Alfonso III., that monarch marched against him, defeated him in a pitched battle, and put him to death  in the month of Rejeb, a. #. 225.

Tarik, attributes a general history.    “ The life of this doctor is to be found also in the fifth book of the first part, among those of the  illustrious Moslems who left Spain for the East; but the author of the improved edition of Al-makkari,  in my possession, has in this instance, as in many others, mixed the biographical notices scattered  through the work with the narrative of events.    ® An-nuwayri (/oco laudato, fo. 465) says that Al-mundhir, to whom he gives the Aunyd or appellative  of Abu-l-hakem, was publicly sworn at Cordova three days after the death of his father. His mother’s    name was Iyyal Jl (stag), not <j) Athl or Athol, as is afterwards stated.    4 Tbnu Hayyén (fo. i.), Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi, and Al-homaydi, agree in placing the death of Al-  >  mundhir at pos Bishter or Yobaster. The first-named historian says, wb oe ps3 is ;    wyt> oI yo Ps oe py Al-mundhir was slain close to the eastern gate of Bishter,    “whilst he was besieging [’Omar] Ibn Hafsstin [in that fortress].” An-nuwayri is the only author  I know who says that Al-mundhir died during the siege of Toledo. His words are as follow:  “ Al-mundhir then took a most solemn oath never again to make peace [with Omar Ibn Hafsstin)  “or raise the siege of Toledo,—even if he should be obliged to transfer to his camp the markets of  “* Cordova,—until that rebel should be in his power. He accordingly besieged him in Toledo, and died  “ during the siege.”   Ibn Hazm, in his Noktatu-l-’ards or ‘ history of the Beni Umeyyah of Spain,’ extracts from which may  be found in Ibn Bashktiwél, accuses ’Abdullah of having caused the death of his brother Al-mundhir by  bribing his surgeon to poison the lancet with which he bled him, which circumstance: would lead to the    >   belief that ’Abdullah was not killed in action, as the word Js used by Ibnu Hayy4&n and other  historians would seem to indicate. Ibn Hazm, however, agrees with the above writers in placing the  death of Al-mundhir at the camp before Bishter. Conde (vol. i. p. 324) says that Al-mundhir was slain  in battle near Hisn-Webdeh (Huete); but what reliance can be placed in the statement of a writer who  makes ‘Omar Ibn Hafsstin die in 270, of wounds received during the reign of Mohammed, when it is an  ascertained fact that he lived during the whole of ’Abdullah’s reign, and was not killed until a. #. 306?  —who gives him a son called Kaleb, fighting battles with the Sult4n’s troops in various parts of the  peninsula; whereas Omar Ibn Hafsstin had no such son?—who makes Navarre, Toledo, Catalonia, and  Granada, together and at once the theatre of that robber’s exploits; when he is known seldom to have  made incursions beyond the provinces of Malaga and Jaen, where his principal force was? The origin of  all these blunders,—which, I need not observe, have found their way into every modern history of  Spain,—lies in a nut-shell. ‘Omar Ibn Hafsetin, being a Christian renegade and at the head of the  Muwallad party, is frequently mentioned in history under the surname of \_JS kelb (dog), coupled with  his more usual appellation of Ibn Hafssiin; Conde, therefore, who had a very imperfect knowledge of the  Arabic language, seeing the words rs) palm vy! wes ‘the dog Ibn Hafsstin,’ mistook kelb for a  proper name, and gave Omar a son named Kaleb ben Hafsun, who fights at Toledo, in Navarre, in  Galicia, and every where, and who, I need not repeat, is no other than ’Omar Ibn Hafsstin himself.",475,,
"    438 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Boox v1.    It now remains to ascertain the situation of 'Omar’s favourite stronghold, the castle of Yobashter or  Bishter, (for it may be pronounced both ways, according as it is found written pe or poy). Tdrisi    mentions a town called Bishter in the district of Rayyah, that is to say, in the province of Malaga, which was  so called because the Arabs from Ray or Reist4n settled in it. Al-homaydi (Jadhwatu-l-muktabis, fo. 54)    says that Bishter or poe, Yobashter, as the word is invariably written in the Bodleian manuscript, was    a castle % }; ove or ye of the district of Rayyah, and he also mentions a strong fortress near  Malaga called paly Bobéshter, which word may easily be transformed into Yob4shter by the single    addition of a point. See the Appendix to this volume, p. xviii. Conde (vol. i. p. 295) says that Omar’s  favourite stronghold was a castle called Yebaster, in the mountains of Ronda; and he again mentions a  place so called belonging to the Ben{ Idris of Malaga (vol. ii. p. 16). The same author states in his  notes to the geography of Idrisi (p. 44) that Bishter was the modern town of Vilches, situated  between the rivers Guadalen and Guarizaz, which is erroneous, for the district of Rayyah never extended  beyond what is now called the province of Malaga. Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi frequently mentions a castle    called jit Bishter, pripuy cea) AP in the neighbourhood of Malaga. Lastly, Ibnu Hayy4n, who    writes Bishter also, mentions it in a manner which leaves no doubt as to its being the same place which  other authors write Yobashter, Yobdshter, or Bobashter, all the difference consisting in the transposition  of the first letter of that word and the addition of one point.   In one passage, especially, he speaks of it in very explicit terms. He says that after the taking  of Hisn-Belay (Espeluy) by Abdullah in a. 8. 278, Omar fled to Archidona; but that the inhabitants of  that town having refused him admittance, he went further to Bishter, where he was soon besieged  by ’Abdullah. From the above and many similar passages which I might adduce, I am inclined to think  that ’Omar’s castle was situated somewhere between Archidona and Ronda, in that mountain chain  extending from Granada to Gibraltar, and which, as well as the neighbouring districts of Malaga, Jaen,  Granada, Seville, and Algesiras, was the scene of that robber’s exploits; but whether Bishter or  Yobashter is to be read, is a point which it is almost impossible to settle, as no place bearing either  name remains at present in those parts, with the exception of a small hamlet called Abistar in the  Axarquia or mountainous part of Malaga, which might very well be the place called Bishter by the Arabs.  However, as the copy of Ibnu Hayyén, which is both ancient and faithful, has always ity Bishter, I  should have been tempted to adopt this reading, had not the four copies of Al-makkar{, which I have  used, and the Gotha MS., afforded me the reading poy Yobashter or pe, Yobaster.    “ Immediately after the above notice of the public officers at the court of “Abdullah, Ibnu Hayyén  proceeds to give a detailed account of all the rebellions and wars by which the long reign of that Sultén  was troubled, and the names and genealogies of the principal actors in them. As this period of Spanish  history is but imperfectly known, notwithstanding its great interest,—for it was then that the two hostile  races in the peninsula, the Arabs and the Muwallads, or people of mixed blood, fought for the possession  of power,—I here give some extracts from that valuable work.    ** Inauguration of ’ Abdullah.    “ On the death of Al-mundhir, ""Abdullah returned to Cordova, carrying the body of his brother upon a  “camel.

No sooner, however, had that rebel heard of the death of Al-mundhir, than he sent  “‘ to Cordova his son Hafss, with one of his principal officers, Ibrahim Ibn Dhamir.   «Abdullah received ’Omar’s ambassadors with every honour; he gave orders that Hafss and his  “« suite should be well lodged and entertained, and having granted them an audience he accepted Omar's  “ submission, and appointed him governor of the district of Rayyah, on condition of sharing the govern-  “ment with an officer appointed by him, whose name was ’Abdu-l-wahhab Ibn ’Abdi-r-rif. ’Omar  “accepted the condition, and remained faithful for some months; but at the end of that time he  “again revolted, and began committing all manner of depredations upon the peaceable inhabitants of the  “ province, carrying his devastations as far as Ezija and Bye) Osuna, in the province of Cordova. The  “rebels were commanded on this occasion by ’Omar himself, or by a lieutenant of his, named Hafss  « Tbnu-l-marrah, who was a man of great experience and courage.   «When the intelligence of these disorders reached Cordova, ’Abdullah sent against him one of  his, generals, named ’Abdu-]-malek Ibn Moslemah Al-biji ; but the royal troops, having met the rebels  “ near Osuna, were defeated and their general slain, which success so elated ’Omar that he expelled from  “ Rayyah the governor appointed by the Sultan, and remained sole master of the province. About  this time the feuds between the ’Ajemis (Christians living under the Moslem rule) and Muwallads    “on one side, and the Arabs on the other, grew fiercer than ever, and they made war against each  “* other in every province of Andalus.   “In the same year ’Obeydullah Ibn Mohammed Ibnu-l-ghamr Ibn Ab{ ’Abdah, governor of Jaen,  “ marched against a rebel named Sa’id Ibn ae Khanjar, and besieged him in the castle of X41) i  “ Jerishah, where he had fortified himself. He was on the point of reducing the place when he received  “ orders to raise the siege and to repair the fortifications of pega we Anduxar, and to people    “it with peasants from the neighbourhood. Scarcely, however, had he began to put his orders in  “ execution, when he was attacked by the [inhabitants of the] yi! 3 Dell Al-bordjelah and Al-  “ asnad, commanded by their respective chiefs, Nabil and Shokhays, who were re-inforced by a body of  “cavalry which Ibn Bartfl brought from Tudmir to their assistance. Having been attacked by the  “ royal forces, the rebels were defeated with the loss of seventy-five of their principal officers.   “ Whilst these events were taking place the district of Sidonia revolted against the Sultén, and the  “ rebellion soon spread to those of Algesiras, Rayyah, and Liblah (Niebla). The cause of these troubles  “was a feud between the Yemenites or Arabs from Yemen and the Beni Modhar.   “In this year ""Omar Ibn Hafestn laid siege to epi! Al-kameneyn, a castle belonging to the Beni  “ Khéled; but the garrison defended themselves vigorously, and Ja’d Ibn ’Abdi-l-gh4fir, governor of  “ the province of Elvira, hastening to their assistance, they drove the enemy off their walls.   “In Sha’b4n of this year the inhabitants of Tortosa sent to Cordova to ask for a governor, and the  “Sultan granted their request, sending them ‘Abdu-l-hakem Ibn Sa’id Ibn ’Abdi-s-sellam. ’Abdu-r-",484,,

These mariners of Bejennah were  “ Africans who settled on that coast about the close of Mohammed’s reign.    “« Events of the year 276 (beginning May 5, a.p. 889).—In this year ’Abdullah left Cordova at the  “head of his army and laid siege to Bishter; but being unable to reduce that castle, into which Omar  “ Tbn Hafsstin had thrown himself with all his forces, he returned to Cordova, leaving the command of the    “besieging forces to Mohammed Ibn wid Dhanin, who took up his quarters at &, Bpéle Malaga.  «© Omar, however, having evaded the vigilance of that governor, united his forces with those of Al-khali’    “ ) Fe At-teker4n{, of Tekern4, and having surprised the town of lao! Estepa, expelled the governor,    Gy and advanced to Osuna, where he did the same. Having, whilst there, received a deputation from the  ** people of Ezija, he repaired thither and took possession of the city. The Sult4n sent against him his  “uncle Al-mundhir, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmén, son of Al-hakem, who had no sooner arrived at Guadajoz    agit wl, than he was met by a deputation from ‘Omar Ibn Hafsstin, who implored forgiveness    “ for his past offences, and promised fidelity for the future, if the Sultén would grant him the government  “ of the district of Rayyah, which was done.  “ About this time also took place the revolt of Sawwér Ibn Hamdiin in the district of the Al-bordjeclah    “ aol soy in the province of Elvira. This Sawwar had been the friend and companion of Yahya    « Tbn Suk4lah, a noble Arab, who was the first to rise in that district against the ’Ajemis, the Muwallads,  “and the Musdlimah or renegades. After the death of Yahya, who was treacherously slain by the  «« Muwallads of Elvira, in a.a. 276 (a.p. 889), Saww&r succeeded him. He made war against the  «« Muwallads, defeated them in several encounters, and took their strongest castles. Ja’d Ibn ’Abdi--  “ ghéfir, one of the Beni Khéled, who was governor of Jaen, having concluded an alliance with the  “* Muwallads, marched against Saww4r; but he was defeated with great loss and taken prisoner. The  ‘* Muwallads then, seeing that the royal forces in that quarter were insufficient to defend them from  “the Arabian party, applied to their old chief, ""Omar Ibn Hafsstin, who hastened to their assistance.  «’Omar was defeated and wounded in a bloody battle, and obliged to return to his usual haunts;  «he, however, left behind his lieutenant, Hafss Ibnu-l-marrah, to prosecute the war, who, having  “« some time after laid an ambush for Sawwér not far from Gharn4ttah (Granada), put him to death.   “ According to the poet ’Obédah, in whose hand-writing I have read the events here related, the war  “« between the Muwallads and the Arabs in the district of Elvira originated thus.

Yahya, moreover, was some time after decoyed into Elvira,  “‘ where the chiefs of the Muwallads were, and treacherously put to death about the beginning of the  “ year 276 (May, A.D. 889).   “* Yahya was succeeded by Sawwé4r, who, as above related, was at the head of the Arabian party until  “the month of Moharram of the year 277 (June, a.p. 890), when he was killed. The poet ’Obddah  “relates the following anecdote, which I here transcribe. ‘I was once told by one of the elders of  “Granada that upon one occasion the Muwallads of Elvira laid siege to the castle of Granada    “ ablié yo where Saww4r was at the time. The walls being crumbled and the fortifications    “‘ out of order, the besieged fought in the day and worked at night to repair them.

Having made a night attack  “‘ upon the palace of the governor, whose name was ’Amru Ibn Sa’fd Al-korayshf, Ibn ’Amrin slew  “the guards, plundered the palace, expelled ’Amru, and remained sole master of the place. He then ~  “‘ made an incursion into the province of Seville, upon which ’Abdullah sent against him his general,  “*Othmén Ibn ’Abdi-l-gh4fir, who reduced Ibn ’Amrin to obedience. But war breaking out again  “between the Muwallads and the Arabs, Ibn ’Amrin took possession of a3 ye Hisn-Karkabah,  “whilst Ibn Khassib and Ibn ’Ofeyr rose in favour of the Muwallads, the former at Montemayér, the  “ latter at Jebal-’oytin (Gibraleon). .    “« The rebellion spreads to Seville.  “In the year 276 the spirit of disaffection and revolt spread to the province of Seville, the inhabitants  “ of which city renounced their allegiance to ‘Abdullah.

No sooner had the Muwallads  «who inhabited Seville and the neighbouring districts heard of the rising of the Arabian chieftains above  “ mentioned, than they entered into a defensive alliance with the Botar and the Beni Modhar, the former  “of whom were the sworn enemies of the Berdnis, and the latter of the Yemenites. Koreyb began by  “ taking possession of a town called bly Balat or Albalate, close to Seville, where he fortified himself,  “ persuading the inhabitants of the Axarafe to join his banners. When the news of his rebellion  “‘ reached Cordova, ‘Abdullah appointed a governor, named Musa Ibnu-l-’4ssi, who proceeded to Seville,  “and who by his moderation and talents succeeded in allaying the fire of civil discord; but Koreyb  “and his lieutenant Jenid dispatched messengers to the Berbers of the districts of Merida and pln  ** Medellin, to inform them that the province was badly guarded, and that, if they were to make an incur-  “* sion, they would undoubtedly meet with the most complete success. Their intention was to harass and  “ molest the Sultan’s troops until they should oblige them to evacuate the province. The Berbers did as  « they were directed; they invaded the province of Seville, laying waste and destroying every thing on their  “« passage, and, having surprised the town of Tablada, near Seville, put the inhabitants to the sword, and  “* carried away their wives and daughters. Miisa then went out against them, and pitched his tents on  “a hillock called Kud'yat Az-zeytiin (the hillock of the olive-trees), three miles from Tablada; and the  two hosts prepared for the ensuing contest. The night preceding the battle, Ibn Khaldiin [Koreyb),  ‘‘ who was in Miisa’s camp, sent a secret message to the Berbers, to say that in the hottest of the fight  he would desert the royalists and go over to them, which he did, the consequence being that the  Sultan’s troops were defeated with great loss, being closely pursued by the victorious Berbers to a  “town called Kariat rm Wabr or Wabar, in the district of pl Al-barr, [elsewhere written rl  «« Aleyr.] After remaining three days at Tablada, the Berbers returned home laden with spoil.   “ After this came the invasion of ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Merwin Al-jaliki, who hastened to that district  “from Badajoz. Having pitched his tents near a town called ped Mora, in the district of Aleyr    “ [or Al-barr, as above], distant three parasangs from i alell the capital, he began to commit every    “« sort of depredation in the neighbourhood, without any one going out to check his progress.   “These different troubles contributed in a great measure to diminish the authority of the Sultén  “in those parts, as the inhabitants, seeing that they were neglected, no longer respected the authority  ‘which did not protect them against their enemies.   “ Moved by these considerations, the Sultan deposed Miisa from the government, and appointed in his    “room Huseyn Ibn Mohammed sup! from Mora. Meanwhile a native of Ezija, named Mohammed  “Tbn Ghilib, applied to the Sultan for permission to build a castle and raise troops with which to repress  “the excesses of the Berbers who infested that province, and principally of one named <LI  « At-taméshekah. As Mohammed was a Muwallad, he soon saw himself surrounded by numbers  “of his party, maulis or freedmen, and Berbers of the tribes of Botar, who willingly took up arms  “ against the Arabian party, commanded by Ibn Khaldin and Ibnu-l-hej4j and their allies the Berfnis.   “« Whilst these events were passing, Suleym4n Ibn Mohammed, the rebel of Shidhtinah, built a strong    ‘castle not far from Xt re) Nebrixa. Having by this means collected round him great numbers of  ‘‘ adventurers, he once made an incursion into a neighbouring island, where Al-mundhir, the Sult4n’s  “uncle, kept his stud, and, having put to death the director of the establishment, carried away all  “‘ the horses and mares he found, and retired to a strong castle named § oe Korah, at the extremity of    VOL.

Mohammed, not considering  “ himself safe in Seville, returned to Cordova. This happened in Juméda the second, [a. #. 276.]   «Some time after these events, Umeyyah was killed [by the insurgents], upon which ’Abdullah  “appointed his uncle, named Hisham Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmdn, to be governor of Seville, and gave  “him as lieutenant Sa’fd Ibnu-l-’abbés. Shortly after, Al-mutref, one of the sons of the Sultén,  “‘ went out against the rebels of Seville at the head of considerable forces. Having defeated them in  “ several encounters, he returned to Cordova, bringing with him as prisoners Khaled Ibn ’Othmén Ibn  “‘ Khaldin, the brother of Koreyb, Ibrahim Ibnu-1-hejaj, and Moslemah Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-1-  “* malek, of Sidonia.   “‘Then came the murder of ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Umeyyah, whom Al-mutref caused to be put to  “‘ death, because he was his personal enemy; but ’Abdullah was so angry when he heard of it, that    “‘he had his own son executed for it.

They were accordingly conveyed to Seville and set free, after they had severally  ‘taken a most solemn oath never again to rise against their lawful sovereign, but to employ all  ‘their energies in reducing the Muwallad faction. No sooner, however, had they returned to their  “ respective districts, than they again declared themselves in open rebellion, and refused to pay the  “customary tribute. ‘Abdullah, however, having through his Wizir, ‘Abdullah Ibn Mohammed Ibn  “« Ab{ ""Abdah, succeeded in dividing them, the rebels made war upon each other, until Ibrahim Ibnu-l-  “« hejaj took both Khéled and Koreyb prisoners, and put them to death, by which means the Sultén’s  “ authority was re-established in Seville.

[Book v1.    said to have been his disciples, can only be explained by a natural wish not to dwell upon a reign  the greater part of which was spent in civil wars and dissensions, and which no triumph over the  infidels signalized. To judge from the great mass of historical information contained in the volume,—  the only one known to exist of Ibnu Hayyén’s Muktabis,—it may be safely asserted that, until the  remaining volumes are found no reasonable hopes can be entertained of ever seeing the history of the Pe-  ninsula fairly disengaged from the mass of error and contradiction by which it is at present disfigured.  One very important fact, among others, is gained by the attentive perusal of the above extracts,  namely,—that for a considerable length of time two powerful factions disputed with each other the  empire of Mohammedan Spain, and threatened in their convulsions to overthrow the throne of Cordova.  As one of those factions, the Muwallads, is but imperfectly known, the works of Conde and Casiri  containing no allusion whatever to them, a few words of explanation may perhaps be desirable. After  the battle of Guadalete, which gave the Moslems the empire of the Peninsula, thousands of the Christian  population in the southern provinces of Spain were cut off from their countrymen of the north; for  it is an error to suppose, as some writers have done, that the Christians fled every where before  the invaders, and took refuge in the mountain fastnesses of the Asturias or beyond the Pyrenees.  Thousands of the vanquished population preferred remaining in the districts and towns of their birth,  under the comparatively mild rule of the Arabs, to whom they paid a moderate tribute, rather than  share the privations and dangers of their brethren among the mountains, which became afterwards  the cradle of Spanish liberty. Many there were who, tempted by the brilliant offers made to them,  renounced the faith of their fathers, served in the army, fought against their former brethren, and  opened to themselves the path to honours and riches. The Arabs, however, always looked upon them  as outcasts, and a distinction was established between the proud Isma’flite and the infidel newly admitted  to the rights and privileges of the Mohammedan community ; and in the same manner as the Moriscos or  their sons, converted to Christianity after the taking of Granada, were called Cristianos nuevos (new  Christians) by the Castilian fidalgo, proud of his unstained pedigree and boasting of his religion, the  Christian renegades were known by the appellation of & Jl... Mosélimah, the plural of Mosélim, a  word meaning ‘one newly converted to Islam.’ The sons and descendants of these were called Hye  Muwallad, signifying ‘ any thing or person which is not of pure Arabic origin,’ and which, being pro-  nounced then, as it is now, in Barbary, mulad, gave origin to the Spanish words mulato and mula.  Notwithstanding their great numbers, and their influence in the state, the Muwallads were always  treated by the Arabs with the greatest contempt. Had the Arabian and African settlers been less  intolerant and more united together, the Muwallad faction would probably never have raised its head;  but during the interminable wars and sanguinary feuds which raged between the tribes of Arabian  or African origin inhabiting the Peninsula, between the Arabs descended from Modhar and those of  Yemen, between the Berbers of Botar and those of Berdnis, the Muwallads sided occasionally with  one or other of those great factions, often obtaining from the victorious party an increase of power.  The Sulténs of Cordova, moreover, frequently found it their best policy to nourish the hatred between  the hostile factions, and to help even the Muwallads against the Arabs; and whenever a sudden coalition  of the tribes of Yemen, or the revolt of some powerful governor, came to disturb the state, they never  failed to obtain the assistance of the Muwallads against their more powerful enemies. It is therefore  not to be wondered at, if, during the reign of ""Abdullah, when the Arabian tribes established in the  various provinces of Spain seem to have come to the determination not to obey the rule of the Beni  Umeyyah, the Muwallads should arm in defence of their rights, no longer protected by a central  government. Assisted by the Mosélimah (Christians converted to Islam), by the Ahlu-dh-dhimmah  (Christians paying tribute), by the ’Ajem (Christians not subdued), and, lastly, by the Muraddiin",496,,

Conde (vol. i. cap. nx11.) says, that soon after the accession of  ’Abdullah, his son ’Abdu-r-rahm4n (who is no other than the Al-mutref here mentioned) informed him  that Mohammed, assisted by his brothers Al-k4sim and Al-asbagh, had revolted in Seville, and had  refused him admittance in that city. On the receipt of this intelligence, ’Abdullah intrusted the siege of  Toledo to his generals and returned to Cordova. The same author states (vol. i. cap. ux1m.) that  immediately after his arrival in Cordova, Abdullah dispatched his son ’Abdu-r-rahmén Al-modhaffer  (Al-mutref ?) against his rebellious son Mohammed. ‘’Abdu-r-rahman made his entry into Carmona and  Seville, which last city his brother evacuated at his approach. Al-mutref having started in pursuit  of his enemy, a battle ensued, in which the rebels were defeated with great loss; Mohammed and his  brother Al-k4sim falling wounded into the hands of the victor. Mohammed was confined in a dungeon,  where he died of his wounds, others say of poison administered to him by his brother, others, again, by  his father’s order, on the 10th day of Shaww4l, a. a. 282 (Nov. a.p. 895). Such is, in substance, the  account given of these events by Conde, who afterwards says (p. 283), that Al-mutref himself was  assassinated at Cordova in Ramadhan of the same year. It is, however, remarkable, that Conde should  call the murderer of Mohammed ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, whereas Ibnu Hayyén, An-nuwayri, Al-homaydi, and  every other historian I have consulted, agree in giving him the name of Al-mutref. Casiri (Bib. Ar.  Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 35) adds nothing to the above facts, except that Mohammed had made an alliance  with ‘Omar Ibn Hafsstin, and that he was killed in action.

Allah!” But neither does the author explain the cause of  Mohammed’s rebellion, nor does he give the particulars or the date of his death.   Tbnu Hayy4n is the only author who might have cleared up the obscurity; but strange to say,  although he generally enters into long and interesting details, he is most despairingly laconic with  respect to the death of Mohammed, which he mentions only incidentally in two places of his work. To  what cause Ibnu Hayy4n’s silence is to be attributed, is a question not easily solved, for he is, without  dispute, the most diligent, as well as the most accurate, historian of Mohammedan Spain. Nor can we  suppose that it was owing to a wish not to throw the blame upon ‘Abdullah; for, at the time he wrote,    ",498,,

About the end of 276 (a. p. 890), in consequence of a civil war which had broken out at  Seville between the Arabs and Muwallads, Mohammed’s authority was disobeyed ; he was besieged in  his palace, and would have been massacred by the insurgents, had not an Arabian chieftain, named  Umeyyah, saved him from the hands of the infuriated mob. Soon after Mohammed returned to  Cordova by his father’s order. An uncle of the Sultén, named Hishim, succeeded Mohammed in the  government of Seville ; but he seems also to have failed in the attempt to put down the insurrection, for  in the same year Al-mutref left Cordova at the head of un army. What became of Mohammed until  A. H. 282 (a. p. 895), when he appears at the head of the insurgents in Seville, we are not informed.  In the spring of that year Al-mutref, accompanied by one of the Sultén’s generals, named ’Abdu-l-malek  Ibn Umeyyah, a relation of that chief who had saved the life of Mohammed, started for Seville; but,  before he reached that city, he had ’Abdu-l-malek arrested and put to death. An-nuwayri gives as a  reason for the perpetration of that murder, that Al-mutref had frequently attempted to remove ’Abdu-l-  malek from the command of the forces, but had never been able to accomplish it, owing to the great  favour which that general enjoyed with his father the Sultan. He had him accordingly seized under some    specious pretext, and put to death. 31 Ji GNd ay ra dl AP ee oF usb.

He also put to death his two brothers, Hisham by the sword and Al-késim  “by poison.”   The above is what we know of Mohammed's fate; but what the objects of his rebellion were, which  of the two parties then contending for power—the Arabs or the Muwallads—favoured his views, and,  lastly, whether he was the victim of his brother’s personal hatred, or of his father’s unflinching severity,    are points for the critic to decide. The expression of which Al-makkari makes use here— WS o =    ra) dat as5!—* Mohammed, he who was murdered by his brother Al-mutref,” by no means removes  the difficulty, since it might have been in obedience to his father’s orders.    2 An-nuwayri says that Mohammed left thirty-three sons when he died, and that the number of  those whom he had by his different wives was one hundred. He likewise says that Al-mundhir left  behind him eight sons,—a statement, however, which is contradicted by Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi, who, in his",499,,

From the narrative of Ibnu  Hayyén, however, we gather that Abdullah had two brothers, Hisham and Al-k4sim, and amongst others,    two sons, wb! Ab4n or Ibén and Abii Umeyyah Al-’4ssi, who commanded his armies, and obtained    many a victory over the enemy. Conde mentions, besides, another of ’Abdullah’s sons, named ’Abdu-r-  rahmén Al-modhaffer, who is said to have commanded afterwards the armies of his nephew, ’Abdu-r-  rahmén III.    3 During the whole of ’Abdu-r-rahmén’s reign, one or more expeditions left Cordova yearly to make  war against the Christians or to chastise the different rebels who resisted the authority of that Khalif.  Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi, in his history of the Beni Umeyyah of Spain, forming part of his historical  cyclopdia, introduces a long poem, in which he recounts all the expeditions of ’Abdu-r-rahman, from  his accession down to the year 322, when that author wrote his work.

The author alludes, no doubt, to some campaign made after 950,  the date of that sovereign’s accession.    10 The city of Zamora, on the Douro, had been taken several years before by Alfonso III. of Leon.  “In the year 280 (beginning March 22, a. p. 893),” says Ibnu Hayyén, “‘ Alfonso, the son of Ordoio,    ",500,,

From that time the city became a nuisance to the Moslem frontiers.”   No attempt seems to have been made during the reign of ‘Abdullah to recover so important a place  until in the year 288 (a.p. 900), when a member of the royal family, named Ahmed Ibn Mu’éwiyah,  indignant at the continuation of the peace with the infidels, collected a body of adventurers and tried,  though in vain, to reduce that city—Compare Conde (vol. i. cap. ux1v.), Casiri (Bib.

Ibnu  Hayy&n (loco laudato, fo. 72) has preserved us an account of this expedition, which, as it contains  information not to be found in the above writers, I here translate.   “In this year (a.n. 288) Ahmed, the son of Umeyyah, son of Mohammed, better known by the  “* surname of Ibnu-l-kitt (the kitten), son of Hishém, son of Mu’4wiyah, son of the Amir Hishdm, left  “« Cordova secretly, and joined a rebel called Abd ‘Alf As-serr4j.

Ibnu-l-kitt, being in the number of the latter, was immediately beheaded, and  “his head nailed under the principal gate of Zamora. This disastrous battle is still known among the  “Christians of those parts as Yaum Samirah (the day of Zamora). It was fought ten days before  “the end of Rejeb (July, a.p. 901), according to ""Isa Ibn Ahmed (Ar-r4zi], who says that he read  “the statement in the hand-writing of the Khalif Al-hakem.

He was born at Menér Jord (one of the copies reads \£) ); we)  in Diy4r-Bekr, in a. H. 288, according to some authors, and according to others in 285. The surname  ‘ Al-k4li’ was given to him because he travelled to Baghd4d in company with people from AP AP    Kéli Kali, a town in Diyér-Bekr. He studied under Abii Bekr Ibn Doreyd Al-azdi, Abi Bekr Al-anbéri,  and Ibn & ghost) 0 Darastuyah, and became one of the most accomplished grammarians of the school of  Basrah: he left his native place for Baghdéd in a. a. 303, and remained in that city until a. a. 328.  *Abdu-r-rahmfn III. sent for him and appointed him preceptor to his son; he made his entrance into  Cordova on the 27th of Sha’ban, a.u. 330 (May, a.p. 942), and by the order of that Khalif a  deputation of the inhabitants of Cordova, chiefly composed of Arabs who were originally from Kifah,  went out to meet him. Besides the Kitdbu-l-amdli (dictations), which he dedicated to his pupil the Amir  Al-hakem, he composed the Kitdbu-n-nawddir (novelties), and another work entitled Fg yl Al-bdri’ (the    conspicuous), the subject of which is not stated; but which Casiri (Bib.

The author, no doubt, means  Sancho I., son of Ramiro II., who succeeded his brother, Ordono III., on the throne of Leon in 955,  being shortly after deprived of power by a rebellion of his subjects, headed, as related in the text, by  Ferran Gonzales, Count of Castile, and Ordono IV., son of Alfonso IV.    31 The usurper Ordono, whom the Spanish historians do not count in the number of the kings of Leon,  was not the son of Ramiro II., but of Alfonso IV. He was called ‘ El] Malo,’ or the wicked.    2 Al-makkari, or rather the historian whose words he transcribes here, has invariably confounded the  dethroned King of Leon (Sancho I.], who was the grandson of Theuda, with her own son (Garcia, son  of Sancho, King of Navarre), attributing to one the actions of the other; or else Al-makkar{ himself  committed the mistake by transcribing too hastily the words of his authority, which is not at all  improbable. The confusion arising from such misplacement of names might easily have been avoided  in the translation; but in this, as in other instances, I have preferred translating Jiterally the text of my  author, however palpable his errors, rather than introducing any corrections of my own.    23 Sancho I. was not the son, but the grandson of Theuda; his mother, Urraca, was the daughter of  that princess.    % That is, her own son, the King of Navarre, and her grandson Sancho, the dethroned King of Leon,  surnamed ‘ Crassus’ (the fat), owing to his excessive corpulence, arising from hydropsy.

He says that Mossilah kept Yahya in prison  until that monarch revealed to him the spot where his treasures lay concealed, when he set him at liberty,  and banished him to Assilah (Arsila). Yahya remained some time at that place, where a relative of his  was then reigning; but having left it with the intention of proceeding to Eastern Africa, he fell in with  Miisa Ibn Abi-l-’éfiyyah, one of Mossélah’s lieutenants, who kept him in confinement for about twenty  years. Yahya was at length released and suffered to proceed to Mahdiyah, where he died in extreme  poverty in a. #. 332 (beginning Sept. 3, a.p. 943). Yahya was the son of ’Omar, son of Idris. He  was the seventh Sultén of his family who reigned over Fez, and the third of his name.    73  35 My copy has ,l<> hojjdm, as printed; but two copies of the Karttds, which I have consulted, have    f  ‘<> hajjim.

In one of the man:  oc g) P 'y y    battles which Hasan had to fight against his uncle, Ahmed Ibn Al-kdsim, the former attacked a horseman,  and struck his steed three times, one after the other, on the mahjdm (that part of the neck where horses  are bled); which being reported to his uncle, he is said to have exclaimed, ‘‘ By Allah! our nephew  is a hajjdm” (bleeder); and the surname ever after remained to him. The same author quotes the  following verse :    - ee ee ° ,  5 { .  pais! ke Ay ws wy es fern) 5 Lels> eg  “ Thou hast been named a bleeder, and yet thou art not such, unless it be through thy striking on    “ the mahdjim.”  The word al-hajjdm has passed into the Spanish alfageme.    % There must be some mistake here. The author informs us elsewhere (vol. i. p. 122), on the  authority of Al-bekri, that during the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahmén III. the Kadi-l-kod4 or supreme judge of  Fez, whose name was Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Abi ""Isa, landed in Spain, and was received by that  Sultan with all the honours due to his high rank and noble birth (Mohammed being a member of the  family of Idris). By referring to Al-bekri (Brit. Mus., No. 9577, fo. 87), I find the quotation correct.  But then I find the arrival of Abd-l-’aysh Ahmed, son of Al-késim Kanin or Kannin, the Idrisite,  recorded in the Karttds under the same circumstances; from which I conclude that there were two  arrivals, that of Mohammed Ibn Abt 'Isa and that of Abi-l-’aysh, both of whom visited Spain during  the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahm4n, and that it was the former, not the latter, as is stated in the Karttds, who  met with the brilliant reception described in vol. i. p. 122 of this translation.    87 According to Ibnu Khaldin (fo. 99) and Al-bekri (fo. 87), they were all sent to Cordova as  hostages for the fidelity of their family. They came escorted by Ahmed Ibn Ya’la, who commanded  *Abdu-r-rahmé&n’s forces in Africa.    38 Al-bekri (Joco laudato, fo. 87, verso) mentions, besides the names of Hasan and ’Isa, the sons of    wy Jannin (Kanniin ?).",504,,

According to Ibnu-l-athir (’Zbratu-J-oulf) he died of Pel vr a paralytic stroke.    Immediately after this passage there follows in the abridgment the following account, said to have been  borrowed from the historian Ibnu Khaldiin. ‘When the Khalif ’Abdu-r-rahmén An-nésir saw his  “‘ power consolidated, he gave all his attention to the erection of palaces and other buildings. His  ‘* predecessors, Mohammed, ’Abdu-r-rahmén II., and Al-hakem I., bad been all fond of building,  “* causing several palaces to be constructed with admirable art and solidity, such as that called lee  q pl Pi) Mejles Az-zéhir, or the pavilion of the flowers; Al-k4mil (the complete or perfect); Al-munif    ** (the eminent), and others; but none was so fond of it as ’Abdu-r-rahman, who is well known to have  “* erected several stupendous buildings, and among others a palace called Ddru-r-raudhah, to which he  «conveyed abundance of water, as well as to the other palaces built by his ancestors. In the con-  “ struction of this palace, which was close to Mejles Az-zahir, ’Abdu-r-rahman is reported to have  “ lavished countless treasures, having employed architects and geometricians even from Baghdad and  ‘* Constantinople. After this he took to building pleasure-houses, and planted the gardens of Mun'yatu-n-  “ nd’irak, which he supplied with water brought from the top of distant mountains. But the greatest  “ work in which he was engaged was the city of Az-zahr4, which he took for his residence and the court  “ of his empire, causing buildings and palaces to be erected there, and gardens to be planted, which left  “« far behind any such building or garden belonging to his ancestors; making besides spacious recesses  ** for wild beasts, strongly railed in, as well as receptacles for birds, covered with awnings of net-work.  *« He had also an arsenal where all sorts of warlike weapons were made, as well as ornamental work and  “ other articles of workmanship. He ordered an awning to be thrown over the court of the great mosque  “ of Cordova, to guard the people, who frequented it, from the rays of the sun.”   Alluding to the buildings erected by ’Abdu-r-rahm4n, I find the following passage in An-nuwayri,  which I deem worthy of being translated. ‘‘ Az-zahr4 was situated three miles from Cordova, on the  “‘ declivity of a mountain. It was divided into three parts. That nearest to the mountain was inhabited  “ by the Khalif, who had there his palaces, pleasure-grounds, &c. In another resided the servants and  *‘eunuchs of the Khalif’s household, and his body-guard, composed of twelve thousand men, splendidly  “attired, and having swords and belts glittering with gold. A detachment of these accompanied the  “ Khalif whenever he rode out, and mounted guard at his palace. The remaining third was laid out  ‘in gardens and pleasure-grounds, over which the palaces of ’Abdu-r-rahmén had a commanding view.  “The whole was plentifully supplied with water brought from the neighbouring mountains. But the  “ most ‘remarkable building in Az-zahré was a pavilion overlooking the gardens. It was supported  “ by columns of streaked marble, mounted in gold and inlaid with rubies and pearls. In front of the  “« pavilion was a sea (large tank) filled with zadék or quicksilver, which was kept in perpetual motion, and  “reflected the rays of the sun upon the pavilion. Twelve years were spent in the building of Az-zahré,  “and the number of workmen employed was twelve thousand.”    An-nuwayri adds, ‘that twelve vie pe Sl Christian workmen of great skill were daily |    “ employed in the construction of ’Abdu-r-rahman’s palace at Az-zahr4, according to the terms of a  “« treaty which the Christians made with him to insure peace.”    # This was not the only motive which induced ’Abdu-r-rahmén to take the measure. According to  Al-homaydi (Jadh'watu-l-muktabis, fo. 5), the appearance of the Shiites in Eastern Africa, and the  assumption by Al-mahdi of the title of Khalif, were the principal reasons. Alluding to this event,",505,,

He died at Cairwin in a.u. 298 (beginning Sept. 8, a.p. 910), at the beginning of  the reign of ’Obeydullah, the Shiite: he was then seventy-five years old.    According to Ibnu-l-abbar, in his dob, Bol) Ifddatu-l-wafddat, Ash-sheybéni visited Andalus  during the reign of Mohammed, the son of ’Abdu-r-rahmén II.

It was he who first introduced into  Africa the literary production known as pis Ulu, ‘the epistles or tracts of the traditionists.’    The above account, however, is in contradiction of what is stated here; for if Ash-sheyb4nf visited  Spain during the reign of Mohammed [a. #8. 238-73], and died in 298, he could not have resided in  Cordova under ’Abdu-r-rahman III., whose reign began in a. #. 300.    44 Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-I-malek (or ’Abdi-l-mdlik) Ibn Aymen is the same author mentioned at",506,,

When that prince ascended  ‘the throne, he appointed Mohammed to be Kédi of Ezija, and afterwards of Almeria, and moreover  ‘* commissioned him to write several works, among which the most celebrated are: a treatise on the Fikh  ‘‘ or ‘legal decisions, extracted from the body of traditions respecting the Prophet ;’ another treatise  “entitled ‘legal decisions founded on traditions preserved by the tddi’s or followers of the companions  ‘‘ [of the Prophet] ;’ and two other works on the decisions of Al-hasan Al-basrf and Az-zahri; the  “former consisting of seven thick volumes, the latter divided into several parts. Ibn Mufarraj died in  “‘ the month of Rejeb, a. #. 378 (Sept. or Oct. a. p. 988).”   The above is not the only writer of Mohammedan Spain known by the surname of Jbn Mufarraj.

The individual mentioned in this passage is the same alluded to in the chapter treating of the literature  of the Spanish Arabs, vol. i. p. 183 of this translation, notwithstanding that his name is there given  erroncously ‘‘ Mohammed Ibn Yahya,” instead of Mohammed Ibn Abmed Ibn Yahya. The theologian  here and there named Az-zahri, and whom I identified with Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Sa’id,  of Basrah, is no other than the celebrated traditionist Abii Bekr Mohammed Ibn Moslem Az-zahri,  whose life is in Ibn Khallekén (Tyd. Ind., No. 574). :    7 See vol. i. p. 175 of this translation, and Conde, vol. i. p. 459.    38 Ahmed Ibn Faraj was also the author of a history of the most celebrated rebels during the reign of  *Abdullah, which is frequently quoted by Ibnu Hayy4n.

Adh-dhobi gives the life of a poet named Abd ‘Othmin  Ya’ish Ibn Sa’id Ibn Mohammed Al-warrék (the bookseller or paper merchant), who is reported to have  composed several historical works for Al-hakem.

His words are as follow: ‘‘ There are  “‘ various dates given for the death of Al-hakem: some say that he died of a paralytic stroke, the 4th  “ day of Safar; others are of opinion that he died at the beginning of Moharram, and that his death was  “kept concealed until Saturday, the 10th of the said month, when it was publicly announced to the  “ people. The latter is the most certain. He was born on Friday, the Ist of Rejeb, a. a. 302, and was  “« sixty-three years, six months, and ten days old when he died.

There is no date upon it; but there can be no doubt of its  having been struck shortly after the expedition of the year 384, which ended in the destruction of the  cathedral church of Santiago, the bells of which were carried to Cordova on the shoulders of Christian  captives.    24 The word used does not exactly mean ‘bridge,’ but a dam (sudd, Sp. azuda) thrown acrose the  river in order to collect the waters for the purpose of irrigation, and yet wide enough to serve as a bridge ;  a very common contrivance in Spain.    % According to the author of the Karttds, Al-hasan had resided in Cordova, as a guest of the Khalif  Al-hakem, from Moharram, a.u. 364 (Sept. or Oct. a.p. 974) to a.u. 375 (beginning June 3,  A. D. 984), when, owing to a dispute about a large piece of amber which the Idrisite prince possessed, but  which he would not make over to Al-hakem, notwithstanding that Khalif had repeatedly asked him for it,  and offered him in return any sum of money he should like to fix, his property was confiscated and  himself banished from Spain, together with other individuals of the family of Idris. The block of amber,  however, remained in the treasury of the Khalifs, where ’Ali Ibn Hamid found it on his taking  possession of Cordova in a. a. 407 (a.p. 1016).

He was a pupil of Abi ’Ali Al-k4li, and gained so much reputation by his works that Al-hakem II.  appointed him to be his son’s (Hisham) preceptor. Among other works,—the list of which may be  found in Ibn Khallekén,—Az-zubeydi made an abridgment of the Kitdbu-l-’ayn, an Arabic dictionary  generally attributed to Khalil Ibn Ahmed Al-farahidi (vol. i. p. 419, note 5), a copy of which is in the  Royal Library at Madrid, GG 5. I have often had occasion to refer to this dictionary, and have always  found it of great assistance in explaining numerous words in use among the Western Arabs. Instead of    beginning with the letter |—the first of the alphabet, as the generality of Arabic dictionaries do, it  commences with the letter € ‘ayn. The reason for this unusual arrangement is explained in the preface.    It appears that Khalil, being unwilling to begin his dictionary by the first letter in the alphabet, owing to  certain grammatical objections which he fully explains, put all the letters into a bag, and drew out one  which happened to be the letter ’ayn, taking all the letters in succession as they came out. Az-zubeyd{  wrote besides a work on grammar entitled Al-wddheh (the clear expositor), which is greatly praised  by the authors of the time. He is said to have been Kéd{ of Seville, and Sdhibu-sh-shortah or chief  of the police guards of Cordova.

Idrisi  makes no mention of it, which is not to be wondered at, since at the time he wrote his geography the  city had ceased to exist. The author of the Reyhdnu-l-lebdb says that Az-zahirah stood at about twelve  miles from the capital in an eastern direction, and was kept with a splendour and magnificence un-  paralleled even in the annals of the East. Ibnu Khaldin, Al-homaydi, Ibnu Bashktiw4l, and other  writers I have consulted, add nothing to the above statement. An-nuwayri is the only historian who, in  a passage which I will afterwards give, affords us a few details. Through him we know that the city  was also called Usb Balis (Velez ?), and that it was so close to Cordova that the rebellion of Al-muhdi  and the dethronement of Hish&m, which happened about the hour of noon, were known there the same  day. The city and its palaces were afterwards entirely destroyed by the Berbers, and the building",523,,

No wonder then that no  vestige or tradition should mark the site of Al-manstir’s palace !    29 Al-manstir is said to have granted privileges and immunities to all those who built or planted in the  neighbourhood of his palace.         CHAPTER II.    1 An-nuwayri (loco laudato, fo. 474) relates that when the news of Al-mansiir’s death reached Cordova,  the people assembled in great numbers about the palace of Az-zahré, where Hishém was residing at the  time, asked to see their sovereign, and expressed the wish that he should take the reins of government  into his hands; that Hish&m dispatched to them one of his chief eunuchs, named Féyiz, saying that he  had already appointed ’Abdu-l-malek to the post of H&jib, and to induce them to go home; but that  upon their refusal to disperse, ’Abdu-l-malek in person went out at the head of his guards and charged  the mob, making great slaughter among them.    2 Elsewhere written Unpl Litnis, which is also meant for Leén. ’Abdu-l-malek made two incursions  into Galicia,—one in 394, shortly after his father’s death,—the other in 398. One of them ended in the  entire destruction of Leon. Rodericus Toletanus (Hist. Arab. cap. xxxi.) places the expedition to Leon  in 394, and says that ’Abdu-l-malek was defeated in the attempt.   The author of the Reyhdnu-I-lebdb says that ’Abdu-l-malek died of poison which his brother, ’Abdu-r-  rahmfn, caused to be given to him in an apple.    3 These events are differently related by An-nuwayri, who gives many interesting details upon the  rebellion of Al-muhdi and the assassination of ’Abdu-r-rahm4n. After giving the deed of inauguration in  nearly the same words as Al-makkari, the author proceeds to say,—‘‘ And when ’Abdu-r-rahmén saw his  “‘ wishes fulfilled, he abandoned himself to all manner of excesses. After this, he bethought him of  “« making war [upon the Christians]. Hisham having expressed a wish that he and the soldiers under his  “orders should put on turbans—a custom which was not in use then—they all did so, and having  “unfurled their banners, they marched [through the streets of the city] in the most despicable plight,  “‘ being an object of ridicule and contempt to the assembled spectators who witnessed their departure.  “ This took place on the 12th day of Juméda the first (Jan. 12, a. p. 1009), and the expedition was called  “in derision Ghazdtu-t-tis (the war of the mud). ‘Abdu-r-rahmén had scarcely reached Toledo, when  “ the news was brought him at the same time of the rebellion of Mohammed, the deposition of Hisham,  “and the destruction of Az-zéhirah. The first act of ’Abdu-r-rahmén, on the receipt of this alarming  ‘« intelligence, was to make his men swear that they would remain faithful to his cause; but, although  “ they all took the oath, they shortly after deserted him and went over to his enemy. The affair happened  “ thus: Hishém Ibn ’Abdi-l-jabbar, the father of Mohammed, had some time before, under the adminis-  “tration of ’Abdu-l-malek, made an attempt to seize the throne and to depose Hisham; but  “« intelligence of his plans having been conveyed to that Hajib, he was arrested and put to death in the  “« year 397 (Sept. 26, a.p. 1006). His son Mohammed, a daring man, who was in the secret, would  ‘readily have followed up his father’s ambitious views, but the fear of ’Abdu-l-malek prevented his    ",524,,

When, as above related, ’Abdu-r-  ‘‘ rahmén succeeded his brother ’Abdu-]-malek, and prevailed upon his sovereign, Hisham, to appoint him  “ heir to the empire, Mohammed seized the opportunity which the unpopularity of that measure afforded  “him, and, profiting by the absence of the Héjib, and the want of troops in Cordova, set on foot  “a conspiracy which proved eventually successful. Mohammed was greatly assisted and encouraged in  “his plans by two influential men, Hasan, son of Yahya, the theologian, and Mutref Ibn Tha’lebah.  «« During his concealment, Mohammed had associated with a number of criminals and adventurers, men  “ready for any undertaking, however great or dangerous; he had communicated his plans to them, and  “ by giving each five, ten, or more mithkdls of gold, he bad united under his banners nearly four hundred  “men. He was, moreover, assisted in his project by a portion of the Beni Merw4n, who had seen with  “indignation the royal power pass from the hands of their own family into those of the Beni Abi ’A'mir,  ‘* and who were ready to join in any desperate attempt against the latter. On his departure from Cor-  «* dova, “Abdu-r-rahmén had provided for the administration of affairs; he had inspected the treasury, and  “issued the requisite orders, and he had appointed Ahmed Ibn Hazm and ’Abdullah Ibn spe ‘Amrah,  “* better known by the surname of Ibn ’Askaléjah, who was one of the Bent ’A'mir, to govern the city during  “his absence. Shanshil [’Abdu-r-rahman] thought, no doubt, that things would go on as prosperously  “as ever for him, and that the power of his family was solidly established. He was mistaken;  “ Mohammed was all the while trying to overthrow it. About this time a rumour was prevalent in  “ Cordova that a rebel would shortly rise against the Beni Abi ’A'mir and overthrow their power. The  “‘ report having reached the ears of Ibn ’Askaléjah, he ordered a most scrupulous search to be made  ‘« in the capital; but, although the houses of several citizens were strictly searched, and other measures  “‘ were put into practice to detect the criminals, the authorities could not discover any clue to the  “conspiracy. At length, on Tuesday, the 15th of Jum4da the second (Feb. 14, a. p. 1009), Mohammed  “ Tbn ’Abdi-l-jabbér, having chosen thirty of the most resolute among his followers, directed them to arm  “* themselves and to enter Cordova by the gate of the bridge (Bébu-l-kantarah). They were to enter one  “by one, and post themselves on the rampart § peal overlooking the road and the river, as if they were  “‘ 80 many idlers; the spot being one much frequented by the inhabitants of Cordova, who repaired thither  «in the evening for the sake of recreation and pastime. They were to remain there until they should hear  “the word of command, which Al-muhdi promised to give them about sunset. The men did as they  “‘ were bidden; they entered Cordova by the gate of the bridge, and placed themselves in the spot which  “had been pointed out to them. Mohammed, in the mean time, mounted on a mule, crossed the bridge  “alone, and presented himself at the gate of Ash-shakkél. The gate happened to be locked; but  ‘* Mohammed, assisted by another party of his friends, who were standing close to the gate of Al-  “ kantarah, threw it open and entered under the gateway. The guards within attempted in vain to stop  “ their passage; at a signal from their chief the rest of the conspirators ran to the spot, and having killed  “all those who opposed them, rushed through the gate into the city. The next thing done was to  “* attack the house of the governor, Ibn ’Askaléjah, who was found in his harem, drinking wine with two  “ of his women. Mohammed rushed into the apartment, slew him with his own hand, and, having cut  “ off the head of his victim, triumphantly showed it to his followers. At the news of this success the  ‘* partisans of Mohammed flocked round their chief from all quarters of the city.   “ The rebels went next to the royal palace, but finding all the doors locked and strongly barricaded,  “ they began to break through the walls in two places, near the gate of the lions (Bubu-s-sabd’), and near  “the gate of the gardens (Bdbu-l-jendn). The guards within made some resistance; they were, however,  “* overpowered, and Mohammed penetrated into the palace by the Bdbu-s-suddah. They say that the  “people and the garrison of Az-zéhirah received the tidings of Al-muhdi’s rising the same day at",525,,

[Book vil.    ‘the hour of ’asr; but thinking it a stratagem of the governor (to try their fidelity], they refused to  “* give credit to the news: at last, when messengers came to them in succession, and they heard that  “‘ Mohammed had actually taken possession of the royal palace, they fortified themselves and passed the  “night [under arms].   “ Soon after Mohammed had entered the royal palace, he received a message from Hish&m, saying that  “‘if he spared his life, he would abdicate the empire in his favour. Mohammed’s answer was thus  “ conceived: ‘ God be praised! my object is not to put to death the people of my family, but merely to  “‘ revenge the injury done to myself and to my cousin. Let Hishdm resign the empire to me, and  “‘ he shall be treated as he ought to be.’ Having then sent for the theologians and chief citizens of  “‘ Cordova, Mohammed told them to prepare a deed, which Hish4m signed in their presence, abdicating  ‘the empire in favour of Mohammed, who passed that night in the palace.   “‘ Meanwhile not a soul stirred at eel Bélis or Az-z4hirah, and, notwithstanding the inhabitants of  “ that place were in great number, and all addicted to the party of the Beni Abi ’A’mir, nothing was done  “‘ by them towards checking the insurrection. Among the functionaries and grandees residing there at  “the time, were Abi ’Amru Ibn Hazm, ’Abdullah Ibn Salmah, Ibn Abi ’Obeyd, Ibn Jehwar, and a  “‘ multitude of theologians, Wizirs, Sclavonian pages and eunuchs, officers and men of the various  “« divisions of the army, store-keepers, civil officers, &c.   “On Wednesday morning, Mohammed I. appointed his cousin, Mohammed, the son of Al-mugheyrah,  “to be his Hajib, and another cousin of his, whose name was Umeyyah Ibn Is’hék, to be governor  “* of the city (Sdhibu-l-medinah). One of the first acts of his government was to authorize the above  “« two functionaries to enter on the rolls of the army all those who chose to enlist, whatever their rank or  “profession might be. Accordingly, individuals of all classes, and of the most peaceful pursuits,  “as men given up to devotion, faquirs, theologians, lawyers, the Im&éms and muezzins of the mosques,  “« merchants, and rich people, presented themselves to take up arms and to receive the gratuity distributed  ** on such occasions to those who enlisted; their example being soon followed by the country people and  “ the inhabitants of the neighbouring districts. This done, Mohammed dispatched his H4jib, Mohammed  “ Tbnu-l-mugheyrah, with a portion of the newly-formed militia, to attack the people of Bélis. At his  “ approach, the Wizirs, the Sclavonian eunuchs, and officers devoted to the cause of ’Abdu-r-rahmén,  “« applied for a safe conduct, and having obtained it, repaired to the camp of the Héjib Mohammed, who,  “after upbraiding them for adhering to the party of the Beni Abi ’A’mir, granted them pardon and  “‘ dismissed them. Only one remained with him; his name was etl wy) Tbnu-sb-sharas, and  “‘ Mohammed purposely kept him near his person, that he might point out to him the spot where the  “‘ money, jewels, stores, and other valuable objects, were kept at Bélis. The inhabitants made no  “‘ resistance, and Mohammed and his men entered the town on Wednesday night. The spoil made  “on this occasion was incalculable. In addition to what was taken by the troops at Az-zéhirah, all the  ‘‘ houses occupied by the maulis or partisans of the Beni Abi ’A’mir, as well as the splendid country  “* residences of the Wizirs and other rich people round Bilis, were gutted of all their contents, the doors  “* even were torn from their hinges, and the buildings pulled down for the sake of the wood. At length,  “after the sack had lasted four consecutive days, Mohammed commanded his men to abstain. It is  ‘‘ asserted that the sums which entered Mohammed’s coffers, as his share of the spoil, amounted to one  “ million five hundred thousand dinérs and two millions and one hundred thousand dirhems of Andalus,  “‘ without counting about two hundred thousand dindrs more which were afterwards found secreted under-  “ground. On the 19th of Juméda the second (Feb. 18, a.p. 1009), Az-z4hirah was set on fire and  ‘reduced to ashes. On the same day Mohammed was proclaimed Khalif in Cordova, and the khotbah  «« was recited in his name in the mosque, instead of being recited, as before, in the name of Hishim and",526,,

On Friday, the 25th of  ‘the same month (Feb. 24, a. p. 1009), Mohammed repaired to the mosque and said prayers with the  ** people; he then proclaimed himself, and took the title of Al-muhdi-billah. After Mohammed had  ‘descended from the pulpit, one of the Im4ms ascended it and read a proclamation calling upon the  “ people to put to death Shanshiil and his followers: people then came to Cordova from the provinces  “« and from the most remote parts of Andalus, exhibiting a very martial aspect. Mohammed appointed to  “‘ the command of this army doctors, butchers, saddlers, and weavers, and he went out with them to the  «« Fahssu-s-soradik (the field of the tents), close to Cordova, where he encamped, ordering the people  “ from the provinces to encamp round his tent.”    4 The same historian, An-nuwayri, gives the following details upon the assassination of Shanshil.  “ Shanshtil had just arrived at Toledo when the intelligence of these events was conveyed to him. He  “ immediately returned to Kal’at Rabah (Calatrava), where he bethought him of swearing in his men a  “second time. The soldiers, however, showed no inclination to do so, and, when applied to, refused,  “‘ saying, ‘ We have been sworn in once, we will not take a second oath.’ This made Shanshiil suspect  “« that all was not right, and he sent for Mohammed Ibn Ya’la Az-zenéti, who was one of the disaffected,  “and asked him what he thought of their respective positions. Mohammed answered him, ‘I can only tell  “thee that neither myself nor any of those who form part of this army will draw a sword in thy  “« defence.’-—‘ And how am I to know this, what proof hast thou of the army’s disaffection ?’—‘ Only  “order thy cooks and scullions with all their utensils on the road to Toledo, and set out afterwards  “ towards them, and thou wilt then sce who follows thee and who does not.’—‘ Thou art right,’ retorted  “ Shanshdl, ‘I shall do as thou advisest.’ There was at that time with Shanshil a Christian count  “ named nese vw! ene wy 2] Ibn ’Aumas, who accompanied him to Cordova in the hope  “« of obtaining his aid against other Christian counts who were his enemies. Perceiving the bad plight of  “ *Abdu-r-rahm4n’s affairs, the count advised him to retire with him to his dominions, and to wait there  ‘‘ until the storm should have passed over, whence they might both return at the head of an army,  “and humble their enemies. But Shanshil refused, saying, ‘No, I cannot do that, I must needs show  “' myself in the neighbourhood of Cordova; for, if I ever reach that capital, I am in hopes that the people  “ will rise in my favour and against the usurper.’—‘ Listen to my advice,’ replied the count, ‘and do not  “throw away a certainty for what is doubtful. By Allah! thy present position is one of imminent  “ danger, and fortune has declared against thee; the army is in favour of the usurper and against thee.’  “«—*No,’ said Shanshil impatiently, ‘I will go to Cordova.’—‘ Do as thou pleasest,’ said the count,  ‘« «T shall not abandon thee, though it be against my advice, and with the conviction that we go to certain  “death.” They accordingly set out from Calatrava on the road to Cordova. As they were proceeding  “ towards that capital, messenger after messenger came to inform Shanshil of the state of affairs in that  “city, and how the people had declared for Ibn ’Abdi-l-jabbar [Mohammed], and were making common  “‘ cause with him. Still Shanshul persevered and would go on. At last, on the 29th of Juméda the  “‘ second (Feb. 28), the army halted at a place called Manzal Hani, where the whole of the Berbers  “ deserted during the night. The ensuing day, the rest of the troops followed the example of the Berbers,  “ with the exception of a few of his own private servants and Count Ibn ’Aumas, who, with his Christian  “* followers, remained faithful to him. Again did the Christian count advise Shanshil to consider his  “* dangerous situation, saying, ‘It is time yet; let us fly at once, before we are utterly prevented from  “doing so.’—' No,’ said Shanshiil, ‘1 will go on to Cordova; but, before I present myself there, I will   VOL.

Meanwhile Mohammed, having heard of the approach of Shanshil and the  “« desertion of his troops, dispatched against him his H4jib with two hundred horse. At some distance  “from Deyr Shis the new Hajib detached a body of cavalry under the command of an officer named  “ Ss. 3 wl Tbn Dhari, who had formerly been a mauli of (the Khalif] Al-hakem. Ibn Dhari used all  ‘* possible diligence, and arrived before Deyr Shus on Friday morning at break of day. On the approach  “ of Ibn Dhari, Shanshiil showed himself at one of the loop-holes of the monastery, and said, ‘ What dost  “thou want? I am ready to obey Al-muhdi.’ After which he ordered the gates to be opened, and he  “ surrendered himself, together with Ibn ’Aumas and the Christians of his suite. In the afternoon of the  “same day, the HAjib himself came up with the rest of the forces, and having previously sent under  “an escort to Cordova the harem of Shanshiil, which consisted of no less than seventy women, took the  “road to that capital with all his prisoners. They relate that, on the Héjib’s arrival at Deyr Shis,  ‘‘ Shanshil went towards him and kissed the earth before him several times. One of those present  “ having told him to kiss the hoofs of the H4jib’s horse, Shanshtl did so, and kissed besides the fore and  “hind legs of the animal. All the while, Ibn ’Aumas uttered not a word, and had his eyes fixed on the  “earth. Before setting out the Hajib made sign to one of his men to take off Shanshil’s cap Fpis—  “‘ which was done. In this manner they marched until sunset, when they halted. On the morning  “of the ensuing day, before starting, the Hajib ordered his men to pinion Shanshvl, which was done,  “both his hands being tied with great force behind his back. In this way, Shanshil marched some  “« distance, until, unable to bear the pain any longer, he exclaimed, ‘ Have pity on me, and untie my  ‘‘ hands, that I may rest awhile.’ Being moved to compassion, the H4jib ordered his men to untie his  “ hands; but he was no sooner free, then he drew, as quick as lightning, a knife which he kept concealed  “* in his sleeve, and aimed a blow at the soldier, who stood nearest to him: before, however, he could wound  “any one, he was overpowered, and the H4jib, coming up to him, dispatched him with his own hand.  «« The same was done with the Christian count, and the heads of both were conveyed to Cordova. The  “ body of Shanshtl, moreover, was by Mohammed’s order taken to the capital, where it was subjected to  “the following operation. The belly was opened and emptied of its contents, and stuffed with scented  “‘ roots to preserve it. His head was fixed on a spear, and planted at the gate of As-suddah. The body  “was then dressed in a shirt and trowsers, and nailed to a stake at the same gate. In addition  “to this, an officer named wlaJl Ar-rasin, who had been Sdhibu-sh-shortah, or captain of the guards of  “ Shanshil, was directed to stand beside the body of his master, and to cry out within hearing of  “‘ the spectators, ‘This is Shanshi] Al-m4min; may the curse of God fall on his head and on mine!’  ‘« This happened on Saturday, the 4th of Rejeb (March 4).   “ The administration of Shanshil had lasted four months and some days. He was a man of vicious  ‘habits and depraved morals, indulging in all manner of debauchery and excesses. He was, moreover,  “an impious man, and things were said of him ill becoming a Moslem. For instance, hearing once  “« the muezzin summon the people [of Cordova] to the mosque in the well-known words, ‘Come, come to  “ prayer!’ Shanshul observed to those who were about him, ‘That man had better say, come to deny  “ God.’ Other similar impious expressions are attributed to him. Shanshiil left no posterity, and in him  * ended the dynasty of the Ben{ Abi ’A’mir.   The word Shanjil, or, as An-nuwayr{ writes it, phat Shanshil, is written Sanciolus by Rodericus  Toletanus (Hist. Arab. cap. xxxi.), and Sanchuelo by Conde (vol. i. p. 562). Sanciolus or Sanctiolus is  the diminutive of Sanctius (Sancho), i. e. the little Sancho or e/ Sanchuelo, and it is not improbable that",528,,
"    CHAP. II.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 491    the word Shanshil was intended by the Arabs for Sanchuelo, notwithstanding the explanation given of it  by Al-khazreji. See Appendix at the end of this volume, p. xxiv.    5 By “the son of Alfonso,” the author means, no doubt, Sancho Garcés, Count of Castile, who,  according to Rodericus Toletanus (Hist. Arab. cap. xxxiii.), and the Annales Complutenses (sub “Era  uxtvit.), lent his assistance to Suleym4n. But the events here recorded will be better understood with  the aid of the following passage. ‘‘ After appointing a man named Ahmed Ibn Sa’id to be his Wizir,  Suleyman and his men marched to Wada-l-hajérah (Guadalaxara), which they took. This done,  ** Suleym4n wrote to Wadheh Al-’4miri, then governor of Medinah-Sélim (Medinaceli), persuading him  “ to embrace his cause and to forsake that of the usurper; but Wadheh, who, shortly after the execution  “* of Shanshul, had sent in his allegiance to Cordova and had declared for Al-muhdi, remained faithful to  «his oath; and, having declined the advantageous offers made to him by Suleym4n, prepared to defend  “himself. Meanwhile Al-muhdi, hearing of W4dheh’s danger, sent a body of cavalry to his aid, under  “the command of a eunuch named Kaysar; but after several sanguinary encounters with the Berbers,  “ the troops of the Khalif were defeated, Kaysar killed, and W4dheh was obliged to shut himself up in  “* Medinaceli. From this place, however, W4dheh was enabled so to molest the Berbers and to intercept  “their supplies, that for fifteen consecutive days the troops of Suleyman were compelled to feed on the  “ roots and plants of the earth. At last, unable to bear privation and hunger any longer, the Berbers  ‘« determined upon sending an embassy to Xgl we! Ibn Maduyah, the Christian, asking him for  “« provisions, and to become a mediator between them and Al-muhdi. Suleym4n accordingly dispatched  “into the Christian country two ambassadors, who, being admitted to the presence of the infidel [chief],  * gaid to him, ‘ Come to our camp and accompany us to Medinaceli; we want thee to negotiate for us a  ‘* peace with Wadheh, the governor, and his master, Al-muhdi; if he consent, well and good; if he  “refuse, we will march to Cordova and fight the usurper.’ It appears that when the messengers  ‘ reached the castle of Ibn M4duyah, they found already there ambassadors both from W4dheh and from  «« Al-muhdi, who were endeavouring to gain the Christian [chief] over to their cause by the most  “enticing offers. They proposed, if he would only refuse his aid to Suleym4n, to surrender to him  “several fortresses on that frontier, and give him besides a number of horses, mules, and money,  “ together with jewels, dresses, perfumes, and a variety of other presents; but the Berber ambassadors  ‘« having promised in their master’s name, that if Suleym4n was victorious over his enemy, he would also  “‘ give up, without the least hesitation, as much as W4dheh and Al-muhdi had offered, Ibn M4duyah  “« rejected the offers of the latter, and promised his aid to Suleym4n. Shortly after this, the Christian sent  “the Berbers one thousand waggons laden with flour of wheat and barley, and other provisions, besides  “ one thousand head of cattle, fifteen thousand sheep, and every article of dress which they might want.  “‘ Greatly comforted by the arrival of these supplies, the Berbers marched to Medinaceli and made  “* propositions of peace to W&dheh; but, upon the refusal of that governor to enter into any sort of  “accommodation with Suleyman, the Berbers eet out for Cordova in Moharram of the year 400  “ (Aug. or Sept. a.p. 1009). Wa&dheh started after them with a view to molest them on their march ;  “ but having imprudently engaged in battle with the Berbers, he was defeated with great loss, his camp  «« was plundered, and he himself had to escape to Cordova with a few followers.”    ® Compare the account of Al-homaydi, as translated in the Appendix to this volume, p. viii., et seq.,  and Conde, vol. i. cap. cv. The account of An-nuwayri is as follows :—‘ Meanwhile, although the  “danger was imminent, Al-muhdi was living in the midst of pleasures and dissipation, without taking  ‘“‘any measures for the defence of his capital. At last, the arrival of W4dheh and the fugitives from",529,,

Having pitched his  “tents in a plain outside of Cordova, called Fahssu-s-sorédik (the field of the tents), he had trenches  “‘ dug all round his camp, and awaited the arrival of the enemy. Shortly after, one of his eunuchs,  “named (3) Buleyk, made his appearance in Cordova, at the head of about two hundred horse, being  “hotly pursued by the vanguard of Suleym4n’s army, which was soon after observed to encamp in  “sight of Cordova. Al-muhdi then issued an order, which was announced to the people by means  “of the public crier, enjoining all grown-up men, without distinction of classes, to take up arms  “and join him at Fahssu-s-sorédik.

So spirited was the attack, that the undisciplined militia of Cordova were unable to  “sustain it, and they fled towards the capital in the utmost confusion, the Berbers pursuing them  “sword in hand, and dealing death among them. Great numbers died also in attempting to cross  “the river, or were taken prisoners. Wa4dheh fled towards the Thagher (the province of Toledo).  “ As to Al-muhdi, he returned to his palace, and, having gone to the place where Hish4m. Al-muyyed  ‘lay concealed, took him out and made him sit on a raised throne under the gate of An-nakkél  “« (Babi-l-nakkdl), leading to the bridge, that those passing by might see him. He then sent his K&di,  «Ibn Dhakwan, with a message to the Berbers, to say, ‘I am Hish4m’s inferior; he is the Commander  “« of the Faithful, and I am only his lieutenant and his H4jib; the empire is his.’ The Berbers answered  “‘ him,—‘ Go along, thou liar! Only yesterday thy master had the death of Hishém announced to the  “« people of this city, and thou didst say the funeral service for him. Thou now tellest us that Hisham  “is alive and that the Khalifate is his. Whom are we to believe?’ The K4di excused himself as  «* well as he could, and returned to Cordova. The inhabitants of that capital, in the mean time, went  “out in crowds to meet Suleym4n, who honoured and welcomed them. After which, seeing the  “ inhabitants favourably disposed towards him, he entered Cordova without opposition, and proceeded  “ immediately to the royal palace: Al-muhdi, however, could not be found; he had taken flight.    7 The author is mistaken. Although Al-muhdi might have implored once before the assistance of the  Christians, he did not obtain it, until he had been expelled from Cordova by his rival Suleym4n; and  then, it was not the Count of Castile—who had espoused the cause of his rival Suleymén—but two  Catalonian counts, Bermond or Veremundus, of Barcelona, and Armengaud, of Urgel, who joined him  with their forces. The following passage from An-nuwayri will throw some light upon these events.   «« Suleymén had no sooner gained possession of Cordova, than Ibn Méduyah applied to him for the  “ fulfilment of the stipulated conditions and the surrender of the fortresses on the frontier; but Suleymén  “said to him, ‘It is not time yet, the castles are not yet in our power; as soon as they are, I will  ‘* gurrender them to thee, according to our agreement.’ Satisfied with this answer, Ibn Maduyah left  “* Cordova on Monday, the 23rd of Rabi’ the first (Nov. 13, a. p. 1009).   «« After this, Suleym4n distributed the government of the provinces [among his partisans]; he quartered  “‘ the Berbers at Az-zahr4, sent Hisham back to his prison, ordered the body of Shanshul down from the  “ post to which it was nailed, had it washed, and decently buried in the palace of his ancestors.   « As to Al-muhdi, after remaining some days in Cordova, concealed in the house of a friend, he fled to  “« Toledo, where he arrived on the 1st of Jumdda the first (Dec. 20, a.p. 1009). Al-muhdi was very well  “ received by the people of Toledo; but he was soon after disturbed by Hisham, the son of Suleymén,  “‘ who set out [from Cordova] to attack him on Monday, the 18th of Jumféda the second (Jan. 6,  “‘a.p, 1010). Before he reached Toledo, Hishém sent to that city some of his theologians, to induce  “‘ the inhabitants to forsake the cause of Al-muhdi; but they refused, and remained faithful to the latter.",530,,
"    CHAP. 11.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 493    *“* About this time a man named Al-korashi A]-harréni, having collected a considerable party, raised the  “* standard of rebellion,’ and had himself proclaimed king [by his followers]. Suleymén sent against him    “an officer named ’Ali Ibn al, Wa’ah, at the head of considerable forces. ’Ali defeated the rebel,    ‘‘ took him prisoner, and sent him under escort to Cordova, where he was put to death immediately upon  “his arrival. Some time after this, Suleyman in person set out for Toledo, in the hope that the  “inhabitants of that city would return to his obedience. Having entered the [lower] Thagher, he  “* encamped before Medinah-Sélim (Medinaceli), where he was soon after joined by a body of his own  “‘ armed slaves, as well as by Ibn Moslemah, his Sdhibu-sh-shortuh, or captain of his body-guard. On the  “arrival of Suleyman before Medinaceli, Wadheh evacuated that fortress and fled to Tortosa, whence he  “ wrote a letter asking that Sultin’s forgiveness for any act of hostility committed whilst in the service of  “‘ Al-muhdi, and promising, if he would pardon his offence, to desert the cause of Al-muhdi and devote  « himself entirely to his service. Wadheh, however, was not in earnest when he made such an offer; all  “he wished was, to gain time and to strengthen the party of his master. Deceived by his promises,  “« Suleyman gave W4dheh the command of all the forces in the upper Thagher (Aragon), and intrusted to  “him the prosecution of the war against the infidels. By these means Wadheh was enabled more  “ effectually to serve the cause of his sovereign. He entered into negotiations with the Christians  “on that frontier, and obtained their aid against Suleyman by granting them, in his master’s name, such  “ conditions as they chose to ask for. Al-muhdi, therefore, was soon joined in Toledo by large bodies of  “ Christians, with whom he set out for Cordova. On the other hand, Suleyman, having been apprised  * of his enemy’s plans, made every preparation for the approaching contest, and issued an order that all  « the citizens of Cordova should take up arms; but upon their representing to him their inability to cope  “‘ with a warlike enemy, he exempted them from military service, at the intercession of the Berbers, and  “left Cordova at the head of the regular troops only. Not far from Cordova, at a place called  «"" Akbatu-l-bakar (the defile of the cows), Suleyman encountered the forces of his rival, on one of  “ the last ten days of the month of Shawwél. The Berbers had placed Suleyman in the rear with a body  “ of African cavalry, directing him not to move from the spot, even if he were to be ridden over by the  “enemy’s cavalry. This arrangement being made, the Berbers advanced to the attack and charged with  “ great fury. Al-muhdi’s Frank auxiliaries not only withstood the shock, but succeeded even in repulsing  “their assailants: Suleyman, perceiving that the ranks of the Berbers were partially broken, thought the  «« day was lost, and, ordering the retreat, fled with his men to Cordova. Meanwhile the Berbers were    “ sustaining with great courage the attacks of the enemy, killing the King of the Franks, named drie    “ Armanghid (Armangaud, Count of Urgel), and sixty of their principal officers. Perceiving, however,  “that Suleyman had left the field of battle, they retired in good order to Az-zahr4, which they evacuated  “the same night. Suleymaf fled to Shatibah (Xativa). His rule had lasted seven months.   “The day after the battle, Al-muhdi entered Cordova accompanied by the Franks, who began to  “commit every excess, plundering the houses, and subjecting the inhabitants to all sorts of cruelty  “and ill treatment. Al-muhdi and W4dheh having requested them to march in pursuit of the Berbers,  “ the Christians left Cordova, and, headed by those two commanders, started after the fugitives. Having  “ overtaken them close to a {J wy Wada Lekeh, a battle ensued which ended in the complete defeat  “of Al-muhdi, W4dheh, and his Frank auxiliaries, about three thousand of whom lay stretched on  “the field of battle, without including in that number those who were drowned in the sea.

The ensuing day, the relics  “ of Al-muhdi’s army reached Cordova, the inhabitants of which were thrown into the utmost consternation  “‘ by the news. Mad at their defeat, the Franks went about the streets of the capital, sword in hand,  “« slaughtering all those whom they suspected of being Berbers; and when requested by Al-muhdi and  ‘* Wédheh to march against the enemy, peremptorily refused, saying, ‘Our king and our best and bravest  ‘men are all slain; we will no longer fight for you.’ They accordingly left Cordova, and returned  “to their country on Friday, the 23rd of Dhi-l-ka’dah (July 8). Some authors say that the departure  ‘‘ of the Christians from Cordova was at the request of the inhabitants themselves, who were terribly  ‘‘ afraid of the Berbers returning and taking revenge on them. So great was their fear of that unruly  “* militia that, whenever a citizen of Cordova happened to meet another in the street, they generally  ‘addressed each other [by anticipation] as men who were about to lose their property, or whose  “children and relatives were about to be executed. After this, Al-muhdi, having obtained a supply  “of money from the inhabitants, made every preparation to meet his rival, and left Cordova with  “« Wadheh, the slaves, and a certain number of citizens; but they had scarcely marched thirty miles,  “‘ when they all returned, fearing an encounter with the Berbers. Al-muhdi then ordered deep trenches  “to be dug round Cordova, and, for further security, a thick and massive wall to be erected behind the  “trenches. Meanwhile the Berbers were plundering with impunity and infesting the neighbourhood of  ‘the capital. Having taken possession of the mountain of wy vw! v> Ibn Hafsstin, a district  “ abounding in springs, fruit trees, and grain of all sorts, they were greatly refreshed and strengthened  ‘through it. Meantime, Al-muhdi was indulging in pleasure and repose; his soldiers were committing  “* all manner of cruelties and excesses, breaking into the houses of the peaceable inhabitants, taking away  “ their property, ravishing their wives and daughters, and murdering all those who offered any resistance.  “« This state of things met with the disapprobation of W4dheh, who remonstrated strongly ; but Al-muhdi  “took no notice whatever of his complaints, and things continued as before. Although Wa4dheh  ‘* followed the party of Al-muhdi, he secretly hated him, owing to his treatment of ’Abdu-r-rahman  “« Shanshil, of whose father, Al-mansiir, WAdheh had been a mauli. Accordingly, being offended at the  “‘ conduct of that Sultan, he resolved to rid himself of him at any risk, and to this end he began to  “ consult with the principal inhabitants of Cordova as to the best means of carrying his plans into  “execution. Al-muhdi, in the mean time, hearing of the conspiracy entered into against him, collected  «all the gold, jewels, and other valuables about the palace, and delivered them to Abd Réfi’ «.,! , Résah,  ‘‘a man from Toledo, with instructions to repair immediately to that city, whither he would endeavour  “to follow him shortly. He was, however, prevented. On Sunday, the 21st of Dhi-l-hajjah (Aug. 5),  *‘ or, according to other authorities, on the 8th of the same month (July 23), Wadheh, mounted on  “horseback, and being followed by the slaves and the border troops, directed his march towards the  “royal palace, all crying as they went along, ‘Obedience to our sovereign Hishém.’ Wadheh next  “ entered the apartment where he knew that Khalif was concealed, and, bidding him come out, made him  “sit down on the throne of his ancestors, and invested him with the royal insignia. Al-muhdi was  ‘‘in the bath, when one of his officers, named 3!cy 9 wy! Tbn Wada’h, rushed into the room and  “announced to him what had just taken place. Dressing himself as quickly as he could, Al-muhdi  “« hastened to the presence of Hishém, and attempted to sit himself by his side; but pee Anbar, the  “ eunuch, took him by the hand, and, having thrown him down from the top of the throne, made him sit",532,,

Hish4m then addressed Al-muhdi, and reproached him in bitter terms for his  ‘« rebellion, and the conduct he had observed towards him, keeping him so long in seclusion. This being  «done, Anbar took Al-muhdi by the hand, made him stand up, and ascended with him to the platform  * of the palace. Here ‘Anbar drew his sabre and attacked Al-muhdi, who clung to him and embraced  “him. In this position he was pierced by the swords of the Sclavonians, the slaves and eunuchs who  “* happened to be there.

[BOOK VII.    bordered to the south on the province of Toledo, is, according to the Christian authorities, the chief  who lent his help to Suleyman upon two different occasions. See Rodericus Toletanus, Hist. Arab.  cap. xxxvii. It is doubtful, however, whether the Ibn M4duyah mentioned in the passage from An-  nuwayri can be identified with Sancho, or not.    13 These events are thus related by An-nuwayrf. ‘‘ Hisham was proclaimed for the second time on  “ Sunday, the 11th of Dhf-l-hajjah of the year 400 (July 24, a.p. 1010). One of the first acts of his  ‘reign was to send Al-muhdi’s head to the Berbers, who were with Suleym4n at Wada Shiish  “« (Guadajoz), hoping that, when they saw it, they would hasten to send him that of the usurper, and  “that his own power would thereby be consolidated. He was mistaken; the Berbers threatened to  “« put to death the messengers, and refused to acknowledge the authority of Hishém. All hopes of  ‘‘ bringing the question to a satisfactory issue having vanished, Wadheh, who had now been invested  “ with the office of H4jib, gave all his attention to increasing the fortifications of Cordova, and prepared .  ‘ for a stout defence. He ordered the digging of new trenches to impede the progress of the enemy’s  “* cavalry, and repaired every where the walls and towers of the city.   ‘‘ Mohammed Al-muhdi had left a son named ’Obeydullah, who was sixteen years old at the time of his  “father’s execution. Having numerous friends in Toledo, ’Obeydullah fled from Cordova, where he  ‘« habitually resided, and repaired to that city, where he was well received by the inhabitants. Thence he  “« made repeated excursions, and put to death all the friends of Wiadheh who fell into his hands. At last,  “a chief, named Mohérib At-tojibi, took him prisoner and sent him to W4dheh, who put him to death.   “« After this, Suleym&n and his Berbers approached Cordova; but being unable to reduce it, they  “ marched to Az-zahr4, which they entered on Saturday, the 24th of Rabi’ the first of the year 401  « (Nov. 5, a. p. 1010), putting to the sword all those they found there. After remaining some months  “ at Az-zahr4, the Berbers left it on the 24th of Sha’ban (Feb. 2, a. p. 1011), and began to lay waste the  “neighbouring country, burning the farm-houses, cutting down the fruit trees, and committing all  “* manner of depredations. From all parts of the province, the country people fled to Cordova with their  ‘“‘ valuables, to escape the fury of the Berbers, and the population having doubled through immi-  “ gration, scarcity of provisions began to be felt in the capital, and great numbers died of hunger. It is  “ asserted, that food became so dear in Cordova that a mudd of barley (that is, two kaffz and a half) sold  “ for three hundred dirhems or one hundred mithk«ls of pure gold. During this interval, the ambassadors  ‘© of Ibn Mé4duyah arrived in Cordova, demanding on behalf of their master the surrender of the  “ stipulated fortresses, and promising not to molest Hishim or his followers, and to make no attempt  “‘ whatever on the frontiers. The truce was accepted, and several large towns were immediately  “« surrendered to them, besides upwards of two hundred castles, which had been in the hands of the  «* Moslems ever since the reign of Al-hakem Al-mustanser-billah, the father of Hisham. This was not  “all; ereleed wy! Tbn Sidlis (?), hearing the concessions just made to Ibn Maéduyah, sent also his  “‘ messengers to Cordova, asking for the surrender of certain fortresses, which were likewise given up  “to him.   “ Meanwhile, the Berbers were traversing the country north of Cordova, and laying waste every thing  “on their passage. No town, however great or strong, escaped their ravages, with the exception of  “ Toledo and Medinaceli; and the desolation was so great that a man on horseback might travel for two  “ consecutive months without meeting a single person on his road. The troops of Cordova, moreover,  “began to murmur against Wédheh, who, being made aware of ‘their discontent, bethought him of  “ entering into a negotiation with the Berbers. To this end he dispatched to the camp of Suleymén a  “ man named Ibn Bekr, who had an interview with that chief; but as he was returning to Cordova with    ",534,,
"    CHAP. I1.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 497    ‘the answer he was killed by the troops of the garrison, without Hish4ém or W4dheh being able to  “restrain them. The assassins next cut off his head, and, placing it on a spear, paraded it through the  “streets of the capital. Hearing the fate of his messenger, W4dheh attempted to fly to the Berber  ‘camp; but an enemy of his, named Ibn Abi Wadé’h, having received intelligence of his intended flight,  “« went to his house with some soldiers, seized him by the collar, and brought him out [into the street).  « There, after reproaching him for the bad use he had made of the public money, and the peace he was  “‘ about to conclude with the enemy, Ibn Ab{ Wadé’h struck him with his dagger, after which all the  *« others fell upon him and put him to death. Having then cut off his head, they fixed it on a spear, and  “ paraded it through the streets of the capital, whilst his body was thrown on the paved road [before the  *« palace), in the same spot where those of Ibn ’Askaléjah and Al-muhdi had been very recently exposed.  «« The house of Wadheh and those of his friends and secretaries were gutted of their contents, and Ibn  ** Abi Wadé’h was appointed WAli-l-medinah. The death of Wadheh took place on Tuesday, the 15th  “ of Rabi’ the first of the year 402 (Oct. 16, a.p. 1011).   “The siege of Cordova continued until Sunday, the 3rd of Shawwél of the year 403 (April 17,  “a.p. 1013), when Suleyman took it by storm. Two days after, on the 5th of Shaww4l (April 19),  “Suleyman entered the royal palace, and, having summoned to his presence the wretched Hish4m,  “ addressed him in these words,—‘ Thou didst once offer me the Khalifate, and pledge thy word to that  “‘ effect; what made thee break thy oath?’ Hishém excused himself by saying that he was not the  “« master of his own acts, and had been compelled-to do so.”    M gail ols —Silah means ‘a gift’ and ‘a joint.’ But the latter is the appropriate meaning in  this case.

Compare Al-homaydi, Appendix, p. xv.,  and Conde (vol. i. cap. cxvii.) Hishém’s chief Wizir, named Abi-l-’assi Al-hakem Ibn Sa’id, having  rendered himself exceedingly obnoxious to the inhabitants, a conspiracy was formed against him, and he  was assassinated in a.H. 422. Hishém then fled to the [upper] Thagher (Aragon), which country he  endeavoured to wrest from the hands of its lord, Al-mundhir Ibn Yahya Al-tojibi. He died at Lerida, in  the dominions of Suleym4n Ibn Hid, on Friday, the 25th of Safar, 428 (Dec. 17, a.p. 1036). In this  latter statement An-nuwayri differs from Al-homaydi, who places his death in 427. See Appendix, p. xvi.    An-nuwayri gives the following details on the death of Yahya. ‘ That Sultén was at Carmona,  “ waging war against [Abi-l-k4sim Mohammed] the Lord of Seville, when, on Sunday, the 7th of Mo-  “ harram, 427, the intelligence was brought to him that a body of the enemy’s cavalry had made a foray  “to the very gates of Carmona. On the receipt of this news, Yahya mounted a horse, and, followed by  “a scanty number of his own guards, rushed upon the enemy, who, retreating before him, led him  “and his men into an ambush, where he was put to death.” Conde (vol. i. p. 617) and Casiri (vol. ii.  p. 208) have both placed the death of Yahya in 417, which is decidedly an error, since at that time  *Abdu-r-rahmaén Ibn ’Ittaf was still governing Cordova in his name. Ibnu Khaldiin says that he was  betrayed by Mohammed Al-birz4lf, the Lord of Carmona.

Quatremére’s learned translation of that work (Notices et Eztraits  des MSS. de la Bibliotheque du Roi, vol. xii.), I will occasionally refer to it in the notes to this  chapter.    2 It was not Idris who sent an army to attack the King of Seville; it was the latter, who, incensed at  the assistance which the King of Malaga had afforded his enemy, Abdullah Ibn Mohammed Al-birzéli,  Lord of Carmona, dispatched against him his eldest son Isma’fl,    2 antl peal ne Ey yd ne eo Gl  eres os ele) Gyles an Robe cslrwt! cra    ett el pt tty pej Xe ye,    4 Tbnu-l-khattfb, in his biography of illustrious Granadians, in the life of B&dis Ibn Habis, places the  death of Mohammed Ibn Idris in a.

Al-bekri (loco /audato, fo. 89, verso) says that he was not  proclaimed Khalif from the pulpits, as had been the custom of his predecessors; and that shortly after  his accession, that is to say, at the beginning of 447, he was dethroned by Bédis Ibn Habis. That 447,  and not 449, is the true date for the dethronement of Mohammed, is proved by a passage of Ibnu-l-  khattib, in which it is said that in 447 Bédis appointed his own son Balkin to the government of the  dominions conquered from Mohammed Ibn Idris. The same writer gives at full length a deed signed by  Balkin, and dated Malaga, the lst of Ramadhan, a. a. 448, appointing the Kadi Aba ’Abdillah Ibnu-l-  hasan Al-jodhaém{ to be his Wizir.    6 «Tn the year 447,” says Al-bekri (/oco Jaudato, fo. 89), “the dynasty of the Beni Hamid was  “overthrown. The last member of that family retired to Almeria, where he was living in obscurity  “ when a deputation from the people of Melilla landed in Andalus, and after much difficulty found him  “ out, and offered him the sovereignty of their country. Mohammed accordingly crossed over to Africa,    “« where he is now ruling as master over Melilah (Melilla) and § i> eX Kal’u Jérah and the adjacent  “ territory; this present year being that of 460 (a. p. 1068).”    7 Al-bekri (ubi supra) makes a different statement. He says that Mohammed Ibn Idris was still alive  in 460; and Ibn Khaldiin (Joco Jaudato, fo. 99) mentions some transactions in which Mohammed Ibn  Idris was concerned in 462. Ceuta and the surrounding territory remained in the hands of the Beni Idris  until Yusuf Ibn Téshefin, the Almoravide, deprived them of all their dominions.    8 This statement is confirmed by Ibnu Khaldiin (Hist. of the Berbers, fo. 70, verso), who places the  arrival of Zéwi in a. a. 391, at which time Al-mansir was still living; but according to Ibnu-l-khattib,  in his biography of illustrious Granadians, Zéwi Ibn Zeyri landed in Spain during the administration of  Al-modhaffer, the son of Al-mansir [a.#. 392-9], accompanied by two of his nephews, Habis and  Habdsah, who were the sons of his brother, Maékesen Ibn Zeyri. Neither historian states at what time  Zéwi declared himself independent in Granada, but it was probably soon after the execution of Suleyman,  by whom he had been appointed to the government of that city. Upon his accession, Z4wi assumed the  title of Al-Adjib Al-mansir.    ° Ibn Khallekén places the death of Zeyri (whom he calls Ziri) in Ramadhén, a. 4. 360 (July,  A.D. 971).    10 Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 255) and Conde (vol. ii. p. 10) postpone the departure  and resignation of Zéwi ten years. Ibnu-l-khattib, who assigns as a motive for that determination the  discontent caused throughout Spain by the murder of ’Abdu-r-rahmén Al-murtadhi, in which Z4wi had  so great a share (see p. 235), gives two different dates for the departure of Z4wi. In his introduction to  his history of Granada he places it [in 410] after seven years’ reign; but in the life of Zéwi himself, he  says that it happened in 416. Ibnu Khaldtin (loco laudato, fo. 70, verso), whilst relating the occurrences  of Eastern Africa during the rule of the Zeyrites, says as follows: “In the year 410, Zéwi returned  “* to Africa, after he had been absent twenty years;” which statement agrees with the date fixed by that  historian for the arrival of Z4wi in Spain.",539,,

Zéwi, who had assisted his brother Mékesen in his  rebellion, was forgiven on condition of crossing over to Spain, which he did, taking with him his two  nephews, Habis and Habésah.—Ibnu Khaldin, «bi supra.

He obeyed, but soon after his uncle’s departure, at  the beginning of the year 411 (May, a. p. 1020), he declared himself independent.    12 Tbnu-l-khattfb gives two different dates for the death of Habis, 428 and 429; the former in the  historical introduction, the latter in the biography.    3 According to Ibnu-l-khattib, Badis died on Sunday, the 20th of Shawwél, 465 (July, a. p. 1073).

He gave him the government of Malaga,  which he held till his death in 454. According to Ibnu-l-khattib (ubi supra), Balkin died of poison  administered to him by a Jew, who was his father’s Wizir.    3  Ibn Khallekén writes this name ont Bolukkin; but my copy of Ibnu-l-khattib, and that of Ibnu    ee  Khaldiin preserved in the British Museum (No. 9575, fo. 70), read always ph Balkin, as printed.

It is impossible, however, to determine at what time Jehwar, the founder of the  dynasty, assumed the supreme command in Cordova, although it may naturally be supposed that it was  soon after the dethronement of Hishém Al-mu’tadd in Dhi-l-hajjah, 420. An-nuwayrf, however,  intimates that Jehwar did not take upon himself the government of Cordova till 429, His words are as  follow: ‘On Thursday, the 2nd of Moharram of the year 427 (Nov. 6, a. p. 1033), it was publicly  “ announced to the people of Cordova that Hisham was still alive, and prayers were recited in his name.  “Things remained in this state until it was said that Hisham was dead, and Abi-l-hazm Jehwar  “assumed the supreme power.” But is it probable that in the interval between the dethronement of  Al-mu’tadd, in 420, and the pretended proclamation of Hisham, Cordova should have remained without  a ruler?    16 Tbnu-l-lebb4nah is the surname of Abt Bekr ‘Isa, a distinguished poet, who resided at Seville, but  who was a native of Denia.

Ibn Bessim (Adh-dhakhirah, fo. 9) gives some interesting details copied from the work of Ibnu Hayydn.  He eays that Hishém was thrice killed and as many times resuscitated. He was put to death by  Mohammed Al-muhdi, and publicly interred as if he had died a natural death. He was next restored to  life by Wadheh, the Sclavonian, who declared that all had been a stratagem of that usurper, and that  Hish4m was still alive. Suleyman had him strangled when he took Cordova, and privately buried; but  many years after the dethronement of Al-mu’tadd, in a. a. 420, the Wizir Jehwar pretended that he was  still alive, and caused the khotbah to be recited in his name in all the mosques of Cordova. Perceiving,  however, that the inhabitants of that city were not averse to his rule, Jehwar gave out that Hisham  was dead, and ruled independently. Lastly, Abi-l-késim, the K4di of Seville, wishing to extend his  sway to other provinces of Spain, announced that he had found Hish4ém in a dungeon of the castle of  Calatrava.    7 Tbn Bessim (Adh-dhakhirah, fo. 17) agrees with our author in placing the death of Abt-]-késim  Mohammed Ibn ’Abb4d about the end of Juméda the first. He was born on Wednesday, the 21st of  Juméda the second, a. H. 361.    21 It was not ’Abbéd (Al-mu’tadhed), but his son Mohammed, who afterwards reigned under the title  of Al-mu’tamed, who took Cordova and dethroned ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Jehwar.",541,,

Al-khazreji (App. p. xxviii.) says positively that he left  no male children, and was succeeded by his grandson Yahya. Caasiri (vol. ii. p. 214) makes no mention  of Hishém; and Conde calls Yahya, in two different places (vol. ii. pp. 57 and 63), the son of Al-mémin.  No reliance, however, can be placed on the statement of the latter author, who, in this part of his  narrative, is more inaccurate than usual, making of Yahya Al-k4dir two persons, father and son, one  named “ Yahye,” the other ‘‘ Alcadir.”” See vol. ii. p. 175.    % The historian Ibnu Khaldin gives the genealogy of Al-mundhir as follows: ‘‘ He was the son of  “ Mutref, son of Yahya, son of ’Abdu-r-rahm4n, eon of Mohammed, son of Héshim (Hish&m ?), the",542,,

Al-  mundhir, therefore, did not belong to the family of Hud, as Conde (vol. ii. p. 12) has erroneously stated.  The Tojibites and Jodhamites were different tribes.    31 According to Al-morrékoshi, Al-mundhir died in a.H. 414 (March 25, a.p. 1023), and was  succeeded by his son Yahya Al-modhaffer, who was assassinated at Granada in Dhi-1-hajjah, a. a. 430,  namely, sixteen years after his accession; but how this account is to be reconciled with the words of  Al-makkarf, “‘ soon after,” it is not easy to determine. Casiri (vol. ii. p. 95) translates a passage from  Tbnu-l-khattib, by which it would appear that it was Al-mundhir, not Yahya, who was murdered by his  cousin ’Abdullah.    cd pul 5) JULI!

The founder of the dynasty was  Abii-l-hasan ’Abdu-]-’aziz, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmén Shanshiil, and grandson of the celebrated Al-mansir,  who, after the assassination of his father ""Abdu-r-rahmén in 399, fled to Saragossa, where he was kindly  received by the governor, Al-mundhir. How soon after his flight he took possession of Valencia it is  difficult to say ; for it cannot for a moment be supposed, as is asserted by Conde (vol. ii. p. 11), that his  rising did not take place till 412. On the death of ’Abdu-l-’aziz, which, according to Casiri (vol. ii.  p- 215) and Conde (vol. ii. p. 37), happened in 452, his son ’Abdu-l-malek Al-modhaffer succeeded him,  who, in 457, was deprived of his dominions by his father-in-law, Al-m4muin of Toledo.

He had been an  eunuch in the household of Al-mansir. After the assassination of ’Abdu-r-rahm4n and the usurpation  of Al-muhdi, he fled to Cordova with other Sclavonians, and shared the fortunes of Khayr4n, who was his  friend, and appointed him governor of Murcia. When the latter felt his death approach, he summoned  Zohayr to Almeria, and appointed him his successor. This happened on Friday, the 8rd of Jum&da  the second, a.H. 419. Zohayr governed his dominions with great equity and vigour for a period of ten  years and a half. He was killed at the end of Shawwél, a. . 429, in a battle fought with Zawi, the  King of Granada, whose states he had invaded. Ibnu-l-khattib adds, that on Sunday, the 24th of  Sha’b4n, a. a. 425, Zohayr took Cordova, where he reigned for a period of fifteen months.    %8 According to Ibnu Khaldiin, Mujahid was the eon of Yusuf, son of ’Ali, a mauli of Al-mansir. In  the year 400 (a. p. 1010), after the assassination of Al-muhdi, Mujéhid left Cordova with other partisans  of the family of Umeyyah, and joined the forces of Al-murtadhi. When the latter was defeated by Z&wi  and put to death, Mujéhid withdrew to Tortosa, and took possession of it. He then left that city and  went to Denia, where he likewise assumed supreme authority.    5° This contradicts what has been said above, namely, that Mujéhid was governor of Denia when the  dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah was overthrown ; but all is explained by a passage from An-nuwayri, cited  by M. Weyers in his excellent notes to Ibn Khékén (p. 114). According to that diligent historian,  Mujéhid was governor of Denia when ’Abdullah Al-mu’aytti and other distinguished citizens of Cordova,  who had escaped the massacre commanded by Suleymén, took refuge in his dominions. Mujéhid treated  Al-mu’aytti with much consideration and respect, gave him a share in the government, guided himself  entirely by his advice, and went so far as to resign all his authority into his hands, and to have him  proclaimed King of Denia in Juméda the second of the year 405 (Dec. a. p. 1014). Three months after,  in the month of Ramadhan (March, a.p. 1015), Al-mu’aytti and Mujéhid sailed to the Eastern [or  Balearic] islands, and took possession of them. In Rabi’ the first of the ensuing year [a.a. 406]  (Aug. or Sept. a. v. 1015), Al-mu’aytti sent Mujéhid to Sardinia with a fleet of one hundred and twenty  sail. Mujéhid conquered that island, and remained in it until the end of the year, when a sudden and  combined attack of the islanders compelled him to set sail and return to Denia, where, finding Al-mu’aytti  dead, he took possession of the government.    # See Appendix, p. xlvii., where Mubashsher is said to have been a liberated slave of Al-murtadhi,  King of Mallorca. This Al-murtadhi was probably a nephew of Mujéhid; for Ibnu Khaldiin says,  “that in the year 428 Mujahid appointed a mauli of his, named Al-aghlab, to succeed his own nephew  “in the government of the Balearic islands.” Al-aghlab and Mubashsher are, no doubt, the same  person. Al-aghlab means ‘ the conqueror.’    41 ’Ali, who was further known by the surnames of Jkbdlu-d-daulah (prosperity of the state) and  Al-muwaffek-billah, was taken prisoner on his return from the Sardinian expedition.

He married  the daughter of Al-muktadir Ibn Hud, King of Saragossa, who, in 468 (beginning Aug. 15, a. p. 1075),  deprived him of his states, and took him prisoner to his capital, where he died in 474. Whilst ’Ali was  at Saragossa, a son of his, named Ser4ju-d-daulah [Abii ’A’mir], entered into an alliance with the Count  of Barcelona, and succeeded, with his assistance, in recovering a portion of his dominions; but he died in  469 of poison, which Al-muktadir Ibn Hid caused to be given to him. Such is the account given by  Tbnu Khaldin in a passage quoted by M.

Conde, therefore, is wrong when he calls him    Amfru-l-mimentn.    ® The word ool khanjar, which Conde (vol. ii. p. 141) translates by “hoz” (scythe), means  ‘a short cutlass,’ Sp. alfanje. The author of the Cronica de Espana (fo. cccxxi.) says that Alfonso was  wounded by a spear.    10 The word translated by ‘‘ tents” is madhdrib, the plural of midhrdb, which means ‘a large tent or  booth.’ See p. 452, note 47, where this word occurs, as used by Ibnu Hayyén.    4 Alfonso VI. lived nearly ten years after his defeat at Zalaca. He was succeeded by his daughter  Urraca, who was some time after besieged in Toledo by ’Alf, the son and successor of Yusuf Ibn    Tfshefin.  Al-makkari has neglected to give us the precise date of the battle of Zalaca, which, according to all    accounts, was fought on Friday, the 22nd of Rejeb, a. a. 479 (Oct. a. v. 1086).    Thus in the Gotha MS. ,yderd! audi Ue Voy! pod acle & ue Gal dst jas Lil  a lel \3]—which, literally translated, means ‘treason takes away the right from the hands of its    owner for a man to defend himself [with it] when hard pressed by his enemy.’    13 Abii Mohammed ’Abdu-1-jelil Ibn Wahbun, whose life is in the Mattmah, by Ibn Khékén, fo. 180.

"    cuaP. 1.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 511    BOOK VIII.    CHAP. I.    1 It has not been said above that Al-mu’tamed crossed over to Africa; but Conde (vol. ii. p. 126)  says positively that the King of Seville went over to Tangiers, where he had a conference with Yusuf Ibn  Téshefin. See also the Karttds, translated by Moura, p. 157.    2 These were Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz, Lord of Murcia, and Al-mu’tamed himself. The two princes having  quarrelled, the latter laid a formal complaint before Yuisuf. The Lord of Murcia was arrested, and  delivered into the hands of his rival. The followers of Ibn ’Abdi-]-’aziz then withdrew in disgust to  their own country, and, by stopping the supplies which they had been in the habit of sending’ to Yusuf’s  camp, compelled him to raise the siege of Aledo. These events are differently related by Conde,  vol. ii. cap. xix.    $ For a description of this castle, which some writers call Rottah Al-yéhid (Rodah of the Jews), see  the Appendix at the end of this volume, p. xlvi. Al-makkari, however, is mistaken when he says that  Al-musta’in Ibn Hid was the first Mohammedan ruler attacked by Seyr; there is, on the contrary,  historical evidence to prove that he was the last assailed. The author of the Holalu-l-maushiyyah  gives a letter addressed by Al-musta’in to Yusuf, in which the former implores this Sultén’s mercy, and  begs to be left in possession of his family dominions, on the plea that he was as fit as any other man to  defend them against the Christians, having been from his early youth trained to border warfare. The  same historian adds, that in order to gain the favour of Yusuf, Al-musta’in sent him a splendid present,  composed of jewels and costly merchandise, which had once belonged to Al-muwaffek, King of Denia,  who was dethroned by Al-muktadir. Al-muwaffek had, it appears, amassed considerable treasures by  sending corn to Egypt, whenever the crop failed in that country.    4 The accounts of the dynasty of the Beni Téhir, given by Casiri in the second volume of his Bid. Ar.  Hisp. Esc., are obscure and contradictory. In one place (p. 215) he mentions three kings of that family ;  one named Mohammed, another ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, and a third Ahmed; whilst in another (p. 42) he  translates an article from the biographical dictionary of Ibnu-l-abbér to show that Mohammed Ibn  Ahmed was the only king of his family who reigned in Murcia. Conde’s narrative, instead of removing  the confusion, increases it, by giving different names to the two princes of that dynasty mentioned by  him ; so that, without a view of the manuscripts consulted by those two writers, it is next to impossible  to decide in this matter. The following account, however, is the most probable.",549,,

After the death of Zohayr, who was killed near Granada, on Friday, the 29th of Shawwal, a. #. 429,  Abi Bekr Ahmed Ibn Is'h4k Ibn Zeyd Ibn Téhir, who was governor of Murcia at the time, remained  master of that city and its immediate neighbourhood. Abd Bekr died in a. u. 457, and was succeeded by  his son Abi ’Abdi-r-rahmén Mohammed, who, in 461, was deprived of his states by Al-mu’tamed, King  of Seville, a chief named ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Raésih being appointed by that Sultin to govern the city in his  name. In consequence, however, of a dispute with Al-mu’tamed at the siege of Aledo, ’Abdu-l-’aziz  himself or a son of his, named Ibn ’Abdi-]-’aziz, was deprived of his government in 483, at which time a  son of Mohammed Ibn Téhir, named ’Abdu-r-rahm4n, was probably appointed by the inhabitants.    5 See the Appendix at the end of this volume, p. xli., where these events are differently related.  Conde’s narrative (vol. ii. p. 173) agrees better with ours. Al-mu’tassem’s son is there called  ’Obeydullah Abi Merwén, and surnamed Mu’izzu-d-daulah (supporter of the state) instead of Hosdmu-d-  daulah (sword of the state), as our author calls him. Ibnu-l-khattib, (apud Casiri, vol. ii. p. 214,) gives  him the surname of Jesdimu-d-daulah (body of the state): the translator, however, did not understand    the meaning of the expression 4521) Syuc Py - 3 (he fled to the opposite coast of Eastern    Africa), which he translated by ‘ad Hispanize orientalis confinia.”    6 The deposition of Al-mu’tamed preceded that of the Kings of Almeria, Denia, Xativa, and other  cities on the eastern coast of Spain. See the Kartlds, translated by Moura, cap. xxxix., and Conde,  vol. ii. cap. xxi.    7 The officer dispatched against Cordova is called se Batti by the author of the Karttés.

Since I have entered on the subject, I must here state my reasons for having so frequently referred in  these notes to the original, instead of the Portuguese translation, and for having avoided giving the name  of its author.

Bibl. voc.

It is probable that the history, in its present state, may be an abridgement of a greater work composed  by Ibn Ab{f Zara’, and which is probably lost. In one of the copies preserved in the Bodleian Library  (Marshall, 582), there occurs at the beginning a species of preface, in which the bookseller states that,  notwithstanding his utmost endeavours, he has been unable to find a copy of the original work composed  by Ibn Abi Zara’, and that should any of his readers bring him one, he is ready to bestow on him, in  acknowledgment for so great a service, a complete suit of the stuff called milaf, besides other presents,  which he names.

His mother was a  Christian slave called Dhi-s-sobdh (light of the morning). ,    2 About this time [a. a. 541] a body of Christians, whom Yahya Ibn Ghaniyyah had taken into his  pay, assisted him in regaining possession of Cordova, where Ibn Humdin had fortified himself. According  to Ibn Séhibi-s-salét, in his history of the Almohades, ‘the infidels committed every profanation,  “picketed their horses in the great mosque, and went so far as to pollute with their hands the sacred  “ Korfn of the Khalif Othmén.” See also vol. i. p. 497, note 27, of this translation.    3 Alfonso I. of Aragon was slain in a battle with Ibn Ghéniyyah, the general of the Almoravides,  near the city of Fraga, which he was besieging. Compare Conde, vol. ii. cap. xxxiii., and the Karttds,  translated by Moura, cap. x].    4 Of the petty dynasties here mentioned, and several more which escaped the notice of Al-makkari,  very little is known with any certainty, inasmuch as the generality of the writers who have treated  of them consider them only as rebels. However, the following facts may be gleaned from the valuable  history of the Almohades by Ibn Sahibi-s-salat.   Ibn Hamdin.—Abi Ja’far Hamdin Ibn Hamdin was the son of Abti ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Hamdin,  a celebrated poet, and Kédi-l-kod4 or supreme judge of Cordova, whose life is in the Mattmah of  Al-fat’h Ibn Khék4n, fo. 150. Profiting by the troubles which broke out in Spain when the news of  *Abdu-l-miimen’s success and the death of Tashefin reached Spain, he contrived to have himself  proclaimed king by the people of Cordova, over whom he possessed considerable influence; their example  being soon followed by the inhabitants of Almeria and other cities. This happened on Saturday, the 7th  of Ramadhin, a.. 538. Scarcely, however, had Hamdin enjoyed his new dignity one year, when  Seyfu-d-daulah Ibn Hiid, who had just been deprived of his family dominions by the Christians, turned  his arms against the new sovereign, and expelled him from Cordova. In Dhi-l-hajjah, a.u. 540  (May or June, a. p. 1146), Hamdin regained possession of that capital, and maintained himself in it until  he was again dethroned, in 541, by Yahya Ibn Ghaniyyah, the Almoravide, who had taken into his  pay a large body of Christians. See Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. pp. 53, 57, 116.   Maymin.—The Beni Maymiin were two brothers, ""Isa [bn Maymin and Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Jén  Maymin. They were the sons of Maymiin, the Lamttnite, one of the chiefs of the Almoravides. The  former, who was governor of Cadiz and Santa Maria, declared himself independent in his governments,  and was succeeded by his son ’Ali, who, in 540, ordered the destruction of the tower of Hercules, at  Cadiz, under the impression that it contained treasure of the time of the Romans. The latter, who  commanded the naval forces of the Almoravides, was celebrated for his maritime conquests. In 516 he  landed on the coast of Sicily, which he ravaged and plundered ; he also took possession of Almeria, and,  having fitted out a fleet in the celebrated arsenal of that port, ravaged the coasts of France and Italy.  In 540 he made his submission to the Almohades, and was present at the taking of Mehediyyah by  *Abdu-l-mimen.",555,,

Ibnu Khaldin says that  they were substantially the same as those of the Almohades. Ahmed took possession of Ebora, Silves,  and Seville also.

The second begins with  the revolt of Ibn Mardanish at Murcia, in a. a. 554, and ends in the year 580, thus embracing a period  of twenty-six years. It is written with great elegance, and contains many interesting details, being  considered by the Arabs themselves one of the best histories of the Almohades. It is occasionally cited  by the author of the Karttds, by Ibnu Khaldtn, Ibnu-l-khattib, and the anonymous author of the  Holalu-l-maushiyyah, or history of Morocco, all of whom bestow much praise on the author, Al-makkari  (fo. 40, verso) mentions an abridgement of this history by Abu-l-motref Ahmed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn  *Omayrah Al-makhziimi, of Valencia.   As to the author himself, I find in the title-page, which is written in a different hand from the rest of  the book, that his name was ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Mohammed Ibn Sdhibi-s-salét Al-b4jf; but in the body    of the work I see in two or three instances written Lal] Lele .)y Axe al we yl Od! UG    “‘ thus saith the author of this work, Abvi ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Séhibi-s-salét.” This would show  the author’s name to have been Mohammed, not ’Abdu-l-malek, unless the father of the author, who  himself was a celebrated historian, be the person alluded to in the above quotation, This conjecture  derives additional strength from the fact that Ibnu-l-khattib, in the life of Ibrahim Ibn Séhibi-s-salat,  says that ‘the latter belonged to a family of historians.” Indeed, the author, whose work I am now  describing (’Abdu-l-malek), frequently mentions a writer, named ‘Obeydullah Ibn Mohammed Ibn  Séhibi-s-ealét, who must have been his own brother. Under the year 564, he says, that ’Ali Ibn  Mohammed Ibn Séhibi-s-salat [another brother of his] was that year taken prisoner by the troops of  Fernando, near Badajoz; but that Yusuf, the son of ’Abdu-l-miimen, who was then reigning, paid the  enormous sum of three hundred gold dinars Eee yee for his ransom, and equipped him besides with    a horse, arms, &c.    12 Tbnu-l-khattib gives the life of Ibn Mardanish among those of the illustrious Granadians, which I  here translate, as it contains many details not to be found in the work of Ibn Séhibi-s-salit. ‘ His full  “name was Abt ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Sa’d Ibn Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibn Mardanish Al-jodhémi.  “« His father, Sa’d, an officer celebrated for his courage and experience, had been the principal instrument  “‘in the defeat and death of Ibn Radmir (Alfonso I.), near Fraga, in a, 4. 528; for, when the infidel  “laid siege to that city, Sa’d, who was then the governor, made so stout a defence that he gave Ibn  “‘ Ghéniyyah time to come to his assistance and engage the Christian king, whom he defeated and killed.  “ His son Mohammed was from early youth trained to arms, At the age of eighteen he was already  “ considered a very accomplished captain. He was a friend of Ibn ’Ayddh [or ‘Iyddh], King of Murcia,  “‘ with whom he became connected by marriage, and who appointed him governor of Valencia. At the  “ death of Ibn ’Ayddh, Ibn Marddnish set out for Murcia, intending to have himself recognised by the  “inhabitants ; but having learned on the road to that city that the Christians had surprised one of his    “ castles, called oped Halal, he retraced his steps, and recovered it. He then entered Valencia, where    “he assumed the royal authority. Subsequently to this, Ibn Mardanish added the city of Murcia to his  “‘ other dominions, and conquered the greater part of Eastern Andalus, having successively gained  “* possession of Jaen, Ubeda, Baeza, Baza, Guadix, and Carmona. He also besieged Cordova and Seville,",557,,
"    520 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [BOOK VIII.    “ both of which he was on the point of reducing: in short, he was at one time the ruler of the greater  “ part of Andalus. His alliance with his father-in-law, Ibn Humushk, and their subsequent quarrel,  ‘have already been related. (See p. 316). Towards the end of his career, {bn Mardanish was deserted  ‘by fortune, and sustained several defeats; the Almohades reduced one by one all his fortresses, and he  *« himself was besieged in Murcia. Indeed, it has been observed, that from the middle of the year 560  “to the time of his death he was never victorious. He died during the siege of Murcia, on the 10th of  « Rejeb, 567 (March, a. p. 1172), at the age of forty-eight. He was succeeded by his son, Abi-l-kamar  “ Helal, who soon after made his submission to the Almohades.” Compare the Appendix at the end of  this volume, p. lix., and Conde, vol. ii. pp. 378-80.    13 T have observed elsewhere (App. p. lv., note 22) that the African historians do not agree as to the  date of the taking of Mehediyyah (Mahdiyyah) by ’Abdu-l-mimen. The most common opinion is that  it happened at the beginning of 555. Ibnu Khaldiin gives some interesting details on the siege and  taking of Mehediyyah by the Sicilians in a.p. 1148, as well as on their former expeditions to that  coast. He says that Mohammed Ibn Maymiin, the commander-in-chief of the naval forces of Spain,  having made a descent on Sicily about the year 1122, Roger, who was then king of that country,  thought that the ships belonged to Al-hasan Ibn ’Ali, Sultan of Eastern Africa, of the dynasty of the  Zeyrites, and sent a large force to invade his dominions. According to the same historian, Mehediyyah  had been taken once before by the Genoese, in a. u. 480 (beginning April 7, a. p. 1087).    14 The anonymous author of the history of Morocco says that ’Abdu-l-mimen embarked at Tangiers.    15 A similar statement is contained in the Karttds; but Ibn Séhibi-s-salat says that ’Abdu-l-mimen  passed | , Hee some months at Seville. I am, however, inclined to believe that ie) ree (two months) is  to be read instead of | ees (some months) ; for I read lower down in the same page that ’Abdu-l-mimen    landed in Dhi-l-ka’dah, 555 (Nov. a.p. 1160), and returned to Africa at the commencement of the  ensuing year (Jan. a.p. 1161).    16 According to the author of the Holulu-l-maushiyyah, 'Abdu-l-mumen is said to have ordered on this  occasion the building of _¢ ssl Kid ‘the greater city’ on the rock.    7 The author of the Karttis, who places this expedition in 556, counts Badajoz in the number of  the towns reduced by the Almohades on this occasion. The place here called Al-kasr might be the  Al-kasar Abi Danis mentioned in p. 194.    18 Tbn Séhibi-s-salét accuses the Jews of Granada of having given Ibn Humushk admission into the  city. According to Ibnu-]-khattib, who treats at length of that chieftain, his name was Abt Is’hak  Ibréhim. He was the son of Ahmed, son of Mufarraj Ibn Humushk, and was of Christian extraction,  his grandfather, Mufarraj, having forsaken his faith and embraced Isl4m at the instigation of one of the  Beni Hiid, kings of Saragossa; but I quote the historian’s words. ‘‘ When Ibn Mufarraj deserted his  “ country and religion, and came over to us, he had but one ear, the other having been cut off. Owing to    “ this, whenever the Christians met him in battle, they used to say 21c.5 l» Hd meshak (here comes the    ‘‘one-eared man). The word ‘ear’ among the Christians resembles greatly our word adhen, and",558,,

After spending some time in his service,  “Tbn Humushk went over to the Christians, and resided for a while at the court of the King of Castile ;  “‘ but, repenting what he had done, he returned to his duty, and betook himself to Granada, where an  “ Almoravide chieftain, named Yahya Ibn Ghéniyyah, was then commanding. When the civil war broke  “ out in 539, and Ibn Hamdin revolted at Cordova, assuming the title of Amiru-l-mimenin (Commander  “ of the Faithful), Ibrahim, who was a shrewd man and spoke the language of the Christians well, was  “dispatched by his master to Cordova, on a message to Ibn Hamdin, whose friendship and alliance  ‘he sought. From Cordova Ibréhim went to Murcia, whose king, Ibn ‘*Iy4dh, received him well, and    “appointed him governor of a castle called eer ee Hisn-Shekiibis. Having subsequently  “« obtained possession of Segura, through which his power was greatly increased, Ibn Humushk made an  “alliance with the rebel Mohammed Ibn Mardanfsh, who then ruled over the greater part of Eastern  “« Spain, and gave him one of his daughters in marriage. In union with Ibn Mardanish, Ibréhim waged  “« war against the Almohades, and reduced several of their cities, until he quarrelled with his son-in-law,  “* embraced the party of his enemies, and made war against him. At last, he crossed over to Africa, and  “« settled at Meknésah (Mequinez), where he died in Rejeb, 572, or thereabouts.”” Compare the Appendix  at the end of this volume, p. lv., and Conde, who, in a few pages, designates this chieftain under five  different names,—Aben Hamusec, Hamasek, Hamusek, Hamsec, and ben Hamusec.    19 The author ought to have said, ‘in the suburb, afterwards called the suburb of the people of Baeza,”  for it was not until the reduction of that city by Ferdinand III., in a.p. 1157, that the Albayzin or  Rabadhu-l-biyizin took its name from the inhabitants of that city, who settled there in great numbers.    2 Abt: ’Abdillah Mohammed, the founder of the dynasty of the Almohades, who assumed the character  of Mahdi, was not a religious innovator, as Conde and other writers after him have erroneously asserted.  He merely preached reform and a closer adherence to the doctrines inculcated in the Kor&n, and to the    principles of the unity of God, for which reason he and his followers called themselves wey!    Al-muwahhedin or unitarians, in opposition to the Almoravides, whom they called opens Al-  mujassemin or corporalists, because they partook in some degree of the opinions of Mohammed Ibn  Kerdém, who described God as finite and circumscribed on all sides, and as being tangible to the hand and  visible to the eye.

CHAPTER III,    1 Ibn Séhibi-s-salét (/oco laudato, fo. 75) gives the following details on the conquests of Alfonso  Enriquez, whom he calls & 2 pdS Welo the Lord of Kolimriah (now Coimbra). ‘‘ Alfonso was one of  “ the most enterprising among the Christian kings of these calamitous times. Profiting by the troubles  “and civil wars which divided the Moslems of Andalus after the overthrow of the Almoravide dynasty,  “he pushed his conquests farther than any other chief of his nation, principally in the districts of  “ Al-gharb (Western Spain). He took Santarem and Beja on the 22nd of Dhi-l-hajjah, a.u. 554,  «which answers to the Ist of December pee of the Christian year 1159. After a stay of four  “months and ten days in the latter city, Alfonso evacuated it, having previously demolished the  “< fortifications. In Juméda the second of 560 (April or May, a.p. 1164), he surprised the city of    ‘  Glo 3 Truxillo; and in Dhf-I-ka'dab of the same year (Oct. a.p. 1165), did the same with 3,4  “ Yeburah (Ebora). He also took wes Cazeres in Safar, 561 (Dec. a.p. 1165), and the castle  “of Ure ie Muntajesh (Montanches) in Juméda the first (March, a. p. 1166). Byash (Severina ?) or    “ Efectos (Sant-Irene), and jlo Jelm4niyyah (Germania), were the next to fall into his hands, the  “« former having surrendered to him on the last day of Jumé4da the first of the same year (April, 1166).   “« The manner in which this enemy of God took most of these places was this: when he had fixed upon  “* the object of the attack, he set out from one of his strongholds where he usually resided, leading a small  “ band of resolute followers, and choosing for that purpose a dark and tempestuous night. Arrived before  ** the fortress, he would himself plant the escaling ladder against the walls, and be the first to ascend.  «« When on the top of the wall, he would listen attentively in order to ascertain whether the sentries were  “©on the watch or not; and when he felt sure that our people were asleep, he would rush upon the  ‘* nearest sentry, and, putting a dagger to his throat, compel him to call out the usual watch-word, so as  “to make the other sentries believe that all was right. This being done, he waited on the rampart until  “a sufficient party of his own men were upon the walls, when, after uttering their usual war cry, they all  “ rushed together into the city, and put to the sword whomsoever they met on their passage.   “ Alfonso took Badajoz in 564 (beginning Oct. 4, a.p. 1168); the Almohades, who composed the  “« garrison, retiring to the kassdbah. Soon after, Fernando [King of Leon], whose tributary and vassal  “the governor of Badajoz was, hastened to his relief, and besieged Alfonso within Badajoz. A party of  “ the assailants having obtained admission into the kassdbak, Alfonso and his followers were attacked on  “both sides in the streets, defeated with great loss, and compelled to leave the city. As Alfonso was  ‘issuing at full speed from one of the gates, his right thigh came in contact with the iron bolt which  ‘secured the gate, and was broken. He fell senseless from his horse, and was carried by his followers  “ to a place in the neighbourhood called % {i Bekaéyah. He was, however, pursued and taken prisoner  “ by the ‘cavalry of his rival, Fernando, who did him no harm, but treated him kindly, and set him free.  « After this mishap, Alfonso never mounted a horse. Fernando evacuated Badajoz in Sha'bin, 564  « (May, a. p. 1169), and returned to his dominions.”    2 Compare the Appendix, p.

The author of  the Karttds says, that immediately after the battle, Ya’kiib advanced upon Toledo, and arrived as far as  Jebal Suleym4n (La Cuesta de Zulema), near Alcalé de Henares; but, that after laying waste the country  on his passage, he returned to Seville, whence he crossed over to Africa.    8 This was Yahya Ibn Gh4niyyah, the Almoravide, who, leaving the island of Mallorca, where his  family had established themselves, sailed to Eastern Africa, and succeeded in rekindling the civil war  against the Almohades. See the Appendix at the end of this volume, p. Ixiii. This Yahya, however,  must not be confounded, as Conde has often done, with another Almoravide chieftain bearing the same  name and belonging to the same family, who, after resisting for a long time the establishment of the  Almohades in Spain, was at last compelled to yield to the victorious arms of ’Abdu-l-mimen, and died at  Granada in 543. The former was the son of Ishak Ibn Mohammed, and the latter the son of ’Alf Ibn  Yahya, who, according to Ibnu Khaldin, was the first of the family who was surnamed Ibn Ghéniyyah,  after his mother. As the family of the Beni Gh4niyyah, who belonged to the Berber tribe of Masifah,  played an important part in the affairs of the Peninsula during the empire of the Almoravides, and some  of its members reigned in the Balearic islands, I here subjoin their genealogical tree.    ’Ali Ibn Yahya,  surnamed Ibn Ghéniyyah    |  Mohammed, Yahya,  King of Mallorca (governor of Spain under the Almoravides)         I |  ‘AK = Abdullah = I[shék    | | | |  Tethah Yahya, Mohammed ""All Tashefin ’ Abdullah,  rebel in Eastern last King of  Africa Mallorca.    9 My copy reads &eij Neké’h, by the simple alteration of one point; but there can be no doubt that  Bekd’h is the true reading.    10 The mosque had been completed under the reign of his father; what Ya’kiib did, was to finish the  tower dnoyo which, according to Ibn Séhibi-s-salét, was begun on the 13th of Safar, a.a. 580  (May, a. v. 1184).

Al-makkari treats of him in the first book of the first part,  giving long extracts from his poems, as well as from several risdleh or elegant epistles which he  addressed to the Sulténs of Morocco and Tunis, stimulating them to wage war against the Christians.  He was born at Jezirah-Shukar, or the island on the Xucar (now Alcira), in a. 4. 585. On the taking of  Valencia by the Christians, in a. p. 1242, he crossed over to Africa, and entered the service of ’Abdu-l-  wéhed Ar-rashid, son of Abi-l-’ala Idris Al-m4min, eleventh Sultan of the Almohades, who chose him  for his K4tib or secretary in one of the civil departments. After filling for some time that situation,  Al-makhziimi was appointed K4di of a town called Kil Heylenah; next of Salé; and lastly of  Mekn4sah Az-zeytin. During the wars between the Almohades and the Benj Merin, as Al-makhztimi  was journeying from the latter place to Ceuta, the caravan of which he formed part was attacked and  plundered by robbers, and he lost every thing he possessed, being thereby reduced to great poverty.  Disgusted with his position, Al-makhzim{ resolved upon repairing to Eastern Africa. To this end  he wrote to Abu Zakariyyé [Yahya] Al-hafesi, at that time governor of Bujéyah, a letter full of rhetorical  beauties, in which he related his late misfortune and the poverty to which he had been reduced. So  touched was the governor by the letter, that he not only invited Al-makhzimi to Bujéyah, where he had  him hospitably entertained, but recommended him to his relative, Al-mustanser Al-hafss{, the reigning  Sultén of Tiinis, who took Al-makhziimi into his service, and conferred upon him a very lucrative  appointment. Al-makhzim{ remained at Tinis until he died, on Friday, the 20th of Dhi-l-hajjah,  a.H. 648 (March, a. p. 1251). He wrote several works, among which the following are the most  remarkable: sermons in imitation of those of Al-jauzi; a collection of epistles in prose and in verse,  addressed to various princes of the Almohades, or Beni Abi Hafss; a history of Mallorca, describing the  state of the island at the time he inhabited it, and its surrender to the Christians, written in imitation of  the history which the Imém Al-isbah4ni wrote of the conquest of Jerusalem; and lastly, an abridgement  of the history of the Almohades by Ibn Séhibi-s-salét.   Here follow in the original MS., but not in the abridgement or in the improved edition, several kass/das  in allusion to the taking of Valencia and other cities by the Christians. The first, rhyming in {» and  addressed to Abi Zakariyy4 Ibn ’Abdi-l-wéhed, Sultan of Eastern Africa, has no name of the author.  Then follows another by Abii-l-baké Séleh Ibn Sherif Ar-rondi (from Ronda), describing the conquests  made by the Christians in different parts of the Peninsula, after the expulsion of Al-m4miun [Idris] from  Spain. Of this last poem, which consists of several hundred distichs, Al-makkarf informs us, that he  saw in Africa a copy to which another poet, from Granada, had made a considerable addition in the  same metre and rhyme, describing the taking of Baza, Granada, and other cities, by King Ferdeland  (Fernando). Next follows a risdleh (epistle) written partly in rhymed prose and partly in verse, by the  above-mentioned Abiti-l-motref Ibn ’Omayrah Al-makhzim{, and addressed to the historian Ibnu-l-abbér,  as well as the reply of the latter, written in the same strained and highly figurative style after which  Al-makkari transcribes a poetical composition of Abd Is’hék Ibrahim Ibnu-d-dabbégh Al-ishbilif, on the  battle of Al-’akéb or Las Navas lost by Mohammed An-nésir. Numerous extracts are also given from  poems by Ibn Khaféjah, Abii-r-rabi’ Al-kal4’i, Ibn Rashid, and Abi Ja’far Al-wakshi, among which  are numerous azjdl and muwashshahdt, two species of metrical composition then greatly in vogue among  the Spanish Moslems, who pass as the inventors of them.   When, in vol. i. p. 408, I offered some conjectures on the muwashshahdt, I was very far from imagining  that I should find in the third book of the second part of Al-makkari’s work a full account of that  metrical form and its inventors; much less that the diligent Von Hammer had just published the identical",564,,

I have since carefully  compared the passage with a copy of Ibnu Khaldin, and found it correctly given. This renders it  superfluous for me to enter more into the subject; I will only add that there seem to be more varieties  of rhyme in the muwashshahah than those indicated by Ibnu Khaldin. As a proof of this, I will quote  here a few verses of one by Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi (Ahmed Abi ’Amrii), who is by some believed to have  been the inventor of them.    Jobat! » dio os Jif 2.

According  to Al-khazreji (App. p. xxxix.), he was murdered in a.u. 485 by Abii Nasr, the general of the  Almoravides, whom Ibn Jehéf had brought to Valencia. Conde (vol. ii. p. 175) says, that Ibn ’A’yeshah,  another Almoravide general, after the reduction of Denia, besieged Al-k4dir in Valencia. The latter,  assisted by Ibn Téhir [the dethroned King of Murcia], made a stout defence; but the Almoravides  having gained possession of the city through the treason of the K4di Ibn Jeh4f, who opened one of  the gates to them, the garrison were overpowered, and Al-kédir himself slain. In the Cronica de Espana,  Alcadubirle (AJ-k4dir-billah) is said to have left his palace disguised in woman's clothes, and to have  taken refuge at a house in the city, where he lay concealed until Ibn Jeh4f found him out and had him  put to death, to rob him of his treasures.    16 Ibnu-l-abb4r, apud Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. p. 43), gives the latter date. Conde (vol. ii. p. 183)  adds, in the month of Juméda the firet (April or May, a. p. 1094). See also the Appendix at the end of  this volume, p. xxxix. According to the author of the Cronica de Espaiia (fo. ccc.), the Cid had been  some time in possession of Valencia during the lifetime of Al-k4dir; but, on the approach of the  Almoravides, he evacuated that city, and abandoned the king to his fate.    7 In the month of Rejeb (May, a.p. 1102), says Conde. The city, however, was not recovered by  Abt Mohammed Modhzeli, as here stated, but by Yahya Ibn Abi Bekr, one of the sons of Yusuf Ibn  T4shefin. See the Appendix at the end of this volume, p. xlii.    18 This Merw4n (Ibn ’Abdilla] Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz is the same individual mentioned in vol. i. pp. 66 and  373, note 7, of this translation. He was descended from ’Abdu-l-’aziz, first King of Valencia of the  dynasty of the Beni Abi ’A’mir. Abd Bekr, the last King of Valencia of the dynasty of the Benf Abf  Amir, who was dethroned by Yahya Al-k4dir, was probably his father.    19 See Appendix, p. lxxi.    2 T have already alluded to this historian in the notes to the first volume of this translation (p. 473) ;  but, led into error by Casiri, I there called him Abi Bekr ’Abdullah Ibn Abi Bekr, &c. His real name  was Abt ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn ‘Abdillah Ibn Abi Bekr Ibnu-l-abb4ér Al-kodha’{ Al-balensi. The  individual above named was his father. See Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 129.   An interesting account of Ibnu-l-abbér and his untimely death occurs in the Reyidu-l-faléh (Ar. MS.  in my possession), which, as it agrees with that given by Ibnu Khaldin (Part vr. fo. 139), I am  inclined to think is borrowed from that historian. I here translate it: ‘ Ibnu-l-abbar (Abt ’Abdillah  “« Mohammed) was at first K&tib (secretary) to Sid Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Ab{ Hafss, grandson of ’Abdu-l-  “« mtimen, when he was governor of Valencia. He afterwards filled that situation under his son Sid Abit  “ Zeyd, and accompanied him to the court [of Jayme I.], when that prince abjured the religion of  “ his fathers and embraced Christianity; but, before Abi Zeyd had accomplished his wicked purpose,",566,,
"    CHAP. Iv.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 529    «« Tbnu-l-abbér left his master and returned to Valencia. Upon his arrival in that city, Zeyyén Ibn  “« Mardanish, who was ruling there at the time, appointed him his secretary; and, when the Christians  “laid siege to Valencia, sent him to Africa for succour. Ibnu-l-abbér repaired to Tiinis, then the court  “ of Abu Zakariyy4 Ibn Abi Hafss, solicited, and obtained the aid of his fleet. He then returned to  “ Valencia, where he remained until the city was taken [by Jayme]; when he embarked with all his  “ family for Tinis. Abd Zakariyy4 received Ibnu-l-abbér kindly, and gave him an office at his court, the  «duties of which consisted in writing the ’alemak or countersign at the bottom of the royal letters  “* and dispatches. It happened, however, that Abii Zakariyyé, who preferred the Eastern hand to the  “ Western, thought of superseding Ibnu-l-abbér, and replacing him by Abi-l-’abbés Al-ghosfni, who  “ could write the hand generally used in the East. Intelligence of the Sultén’s determination having  « reached Ibnu-l-abb4r, he was exceedingly angry and piqued at the preference given to the Eastern hand,  “and lost no opportunity of making his discontent known to the Sultan. Some time after, Ibnu-l-abbar  “ received orders to write a letter in the Sultdén’s name, but to leave a blank for the ’alemah, which was  ** to have been filled by Al-ghoséni; but instead of complying with the order, he not only did as before,  “« but wrote it in a larger hand than usual. Having been upbraided for his disobedience to his superior in  “the office, he flew into a most violent passion, threw down the pen with which he was then writing,  “and spoke in very indecorous terms of Abi Zakariyyé, which being reported to that Sultén, he gave  “ orders that Ibnu-l-abbér should be kept a prisoner in his own dwelling until he decided upon the kind  “ of punishment to be inflicted upon him for his disrespect. During his seclusion, Ibnu-l-abbér applied  “for permission to write a paper on the Kétibs who had momentarily lost the favour of their masters,  “but had been restored to it; and having obtained it, produced his celebrated tract entitled Wotcl    G wid! “the return to favour of the scribes,” which was so much liked by Abu Zakariyy& that he  ** forgave his offence and restored him to his office. Abti Zakariyyé was succeeded on the throne by his  “gon Al-mustanser, who not only confirmed Ibnu-l-abbér in his office, but promoted him to the rank of  “Wizir. Ibnu-l-abb4r, however, had a bitter enemy in the person of Ibn Ab{ Huseyn, one of  «« Al-mustanser’s courtiers, who, being on bad terms with him ever since his first visit to Ténis, never  “lost an opportunity of doing him all the harm he could. Having one day accused Ibnu-l-abbér of  “ being implicated in a conspiracy to dethrone Al-mustanser, a search was made among his papers, and  “* they say that there was found one in verse which began thus:  ‘In Tunis rules a tyrant, whom wicked people call Khalif.’   “No sooner had Al-mustanser cast his eyes over the contents of the paper, than he sent some of his  “ guards to Ibnu-l-abbér’s dwelling, with orders to put him to death; which was done, the soldiers  “* striking him with their spears. Others relate this differently; but there can be no doubt as to the  “‘lamentable end of this celebrated writer. He was executed on the 15th of Moharram, a.u. 658  « (Jan. a. D. 1260), his head cut off, and fixed to a stake, after which his body was burned in one of the  “ squares of Tiinis, together with all his works and a valuable library which he had brought over from  “ Andalus.”   According to the explanation given by this author of the object of Ibnu-l-abbar’s work, I am inclined    to think that Wolicl is not, as I first thought, the plural of ic ‘atab, meaning ‘a step or degree,’    oF  but the noun of action of the fourth form, Wic! —and that the title of the work is to be translated    by “‘ the return to favour of the scribes or secretaries.”  Besides his Tekmflah, or supplement to the biographical dictionary of Al-homaydi, Ibnu-l-abb4r wrote,  VOL.

He had been governor of Granada at the beginning of his father’s reign.    2 Conde (vol. ii. p. 347) places the taking of Almeria by Abi Sa’fd in 552, ten years after its  occupation by the Castilians ; but the author of the Karttds, Ibn Sahibi-s-salét, and Ibnu Khaldin, agree  in giving the date of 546.    26 A)-mutawakkel Ibn Hid left a son named Abi Bekr Al-wéthik-billah, whom he had previously  appointed to succeed him. He had besides three brothers: Abu-n-nejét Sélim, surnamed ’Jmddu-d-daulah  (column of the state), who was governor of Seville; Abi Is‘hak Sherfu-d-daulak (ornament of the state) ;  and Abi-l-hasan ’Adhadu-d-daulak (arm of the state). The latter was taken prisoner by the Christians ;  but his brother Mohammed paid a considerable ransom for him, and he was set free. Nothing can  be more obscure and contradictory than the few accounts we have of these princes respectively; the  confusion being greatly increased by the fact that all four are generally designated in history by their  family appellation, Jon Hiid, without their distinctive names or surnames. After the death of Mohammed,  i. e, on the 4th of Moharram, a. #. 636 (Aug. 26, a. pv. 1238), his brother, ’Adhadu-d-daulah [’Ali Ibn  Yusuf], who was governor of Murcia, caused himself to be proclaimed by the inhabitants; but scarcely  had he reigned eight months, when Abi Jemil Zeyy4n, the dethroned King of Valencia, turned his arms  against him, took his capital, and put him to death on Friday, the 15th of Ramadhan of the same year  (Conde, vol. iii. p. 21). This account, however, is contradicted by Ibnu Khaldiin (App. p. Ixxviii.) and  Casiri (vol. ii. p. 64), who say that the victim of Abi Jem{l was a noble chief named Abii Bekr ’Aziz Ibn  Khatt4b, who had reigned in Murcia ever since the death of Al-mutawakkel.   In a. Hn. 638, Abt ’Abdillah Mohammed, the son of ’Alf, regained possession of his capital; and in the  ensuing year [4.H. 639] became a vassal of Ferdinand III. of Castile, and admitted a Christian garrison  into the citadel of Murcia; but, either the Christian conqueror was not satisfied with this mark of    ",568,,
"    CHAP. V.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 531    vassalage, or, what is more probable, Ibn Hid entered into some secret compact with Ibnu-l-ahmar,  Sult4n of Granada, to rid himself of his guests: the fact is, that in a.a. 640, Ferdinand sent against  Murcia his son Alfonso, who took possession of the city and dethroned Ibn Hid. It must, however, be  observed, that whilst Ibnu-]-khattib and other Mohammedan writers place the taking of Murcia in 640,  Cascales (Discursos Historicos de Murcia, fo. 18) says, that it took place at the end of 638; and he quotes  even a grant of land by Ferdinand to the monastery of St. Mary of Valpuesta, made in Murcia, and  bearing the date of July 2, 1241.   Meanwhile Al-wéthik, the son of Al-mutawakkel, lived in obscurity. Ibnu-r-remim{ not only refused  to acknowledge him as his father’s successor, but gave up Almeria to Ibnu-l-ahmar, the Sultén of  Granada. Deprived of the capital of his kingdom, Al-wéthik withdrew to a strong castle in the  neighbourhood of Almeria, where he defended himself against the attacks of Ibnu-l-ahmar. When,  in the year 1261, the Moslems of Andalusia resolved, in concert with Ibnu-l-ahmar, to shake off the  Castilian yoke, the people of Murcia seem to have chosen Al-w4thik for their king; for we see him figure  in the Cronica de Don Alfonso el Sabio under the corrupt name of Alboaques. Murcia, however, was  speedily reduced by Alfonso X. and his auxiliary, Jayme of Aragon, and Al-wéthik deprived of his states ;  but the Castilian king, wishing, as his chronicler informs us (fo. viii.), ‘‘ to have a king for a vassal,”  appointed to the vacant throne “un hermano de Abenhud,” a brother of [Al-mutawakkel] Ibn Hid,  probably the same Ahmed mentioned by Ibnu Khaldin (App. p. lxxviii.), unless he be the same  Mohammed who had filled the throne of Cordova on a former occasion.   According to Cascales (Discursos Historicos, fo. 25), the second taking of Murcia happened on the 13th  of January, 1265, a date which can nowise be reconciled with those here assigned for that event, much  less with that given by Ibnu Khaldin.

He then adds, on the  authority of a man who was present at the interview, ‘“ On this occasion Abi Yusuf gave a remarkable  ** proof of the contempt in which he held the Christian king; for when Alfonso had submissively kissed  “his hand, he, after the usual compliments, asked in his very presence for water wherewith to wash the  *« stain of the infidel off his hands.   “This brings to my recollection a curious incident which happened once to me, and which I will now    “ relate, vouching for its truth.— A Jewish doctor, named Ibn y iy Razar, came once to Granada, under    “the reign of the grandson of this same Alfonso [Pedro], and visited me upon business. On his entering  “‘ the room, where I was sitting with the K4di-l-kod4 of Granada and other government functionaries, he  “« presented to me a paper signed by the Sultén of Western Africa, Mohammed, the son of ’Abdu-r-  “‘rahm4n, son of the Sultén Abi-l-hasan. This Mohammed, having been dethroned by a kinsman  “« of his, fled to the court of the King of Castile, whose assistance he implored against the usurper of his  “throne. This was readily granted, and Mohammed, having subscribed to such conditions as were  ‘imposed upon him, obtained the aid of King Pedro, and recovered his throne. It appears, however,  “ that a dispute arose between the two as to the manner in which one of the conditions of the treaty was  “to be fulfilled, and the Jew was accordingly dispatched to me to know my opinion on the disputed  “clause. Upon his entering the room, the Jew said to me, ‘ My master the Sultan Don Pedro salutes  “thee, and requests thee to look over the contents of this paper and the offers made to him by a man  ‘who was only yesterday the most abject dog at his court, but who now boasts of his perfidy and  ‘treason.’ I took the letter from the Jew, and, having perused its contents, returned it to him, saying,  «Take it away, I will not see it, nor will I give my opinion upon it, and decide between thee and  “‘the man whom thou callest a dog.

He was a native of Ronda, but originally from Seville. At the age of three-and-twenty he left  his native city, and made a pilgrimage to Mekka, visiting on his way thither the principal cities of Syria  and ’Irék, where he failed not to profit by the lessons of the most distinguished authors of the time. On  his return to Ronda, at the end of 685, he devoted himself entirely to the cultivation of literature,  and the lectures which he gave were attended by numerous disciples. Having composed a poem in  praise of Mohammed II. of Granada, he presented it to that Sultén, who was so pleased with it that he  summoned the author to Granada, and appointed him his Kdtibu-l-anshd, or secretary for the foreign  correspondence. On the death of Mohammed II., his son and successor, Mohammed III., being pleased  with his services, promoted Ibnu-l-hakim to the Wizirate, allowing him to retain his former appointment ;  so that he became Dhi-l-wizdrateyn, or holder of the two Wizirates.   A)-makkari does not inform us how Ibnu-l-hakim worked his own ruin and that of his master; but  Ibnu-l-khattib says, at the time that he does justice to his wisdom and talents, that he was a man  of overbearing temper, very proud, and exceedingly avaricious. Although he was absent from home  when the mob broke into his house, he was afterwards discovered in one of the rooms of the palace  and put to death. Ibnu-l-khattib laments the loss of a valuable library which he had collected at great  expense, and in which were some works composed by Ibnu-l-hakim, such as a history of Mohammedan  Spain from the conquest to his own times. Ibnu-1-hakim left a son, also named Mohammed Ibnu-1-hakim,    who wrote, among other works, one entitled Dinkins] Opel 3 paeecel oul all “ selection of useful  things and profitable allegations,” and a supplement to the (},»!

"    CHAP. V.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 535    20 Mohammed Ibn ’Ali Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Mohammed, surnamed Abii ’Abdillah Ibnu-1-héj, was born  at Seville in a.u. 670, where he exercised the trade of engineer and carpenter. While young he crossed  over to Africa, and entered Fez, at that time the court of Abii Yusuf Ya’kub Al-mansur, the Merinite,  for whom he executed different works in that part of the city called New Fez, as well as within the  precincts of his palace, &c. It was he who constructed the arsenal of Salé. Ibnu-]-khattib, who gives  the life of Ibnu-l-h4j among those of his illustrious Granadians, says that he was “a profound  “ geometrician, and had much experience in making the hollow tubes,” a species of cannon then in use  among the Spanish Moslems: Ls3 aI! 5 isle in! oI! SLSL Vey yS—This  recommended him to the notice of Mohammed II. of Granada, who invited him to his court, and gave  him employment. Abi-l-jiytish Nasr, the fourth of the Beni Nasr, appointed him to be his Wizir; but,  being accused of corresponding with the Christians, of affecting to speak their language, and dress  like them, he made numerous enemies. When the revolution broke out, which deprived Nasr of his  throne, Ibnu-1-h4j fled from Granada and crossed over to Africa, where he died in 714.    2 KKsuul] — See above, p. 534, note 15.  3s  % sUilaall d 5 ‘the hamlet of the thirsty men.” Casiri (vol. ii. p. 286) calls it Athocha.    3 An-nuwayri, in his history of Egypt, forming part of his Cyclopedia, gives two different accounts of  this battle, which, he says, reached Cairo at the beginning of a.w. 720. The first of them is in  substance the same as that given by Al-makkari, who, no doubt, borrowed it from the work of that  historian. The second, which reached Egypt in the form of a letter from the Sheikh Huseyn Ibn  ’Abdi-s-sell4m, differs in some material points; and I here translate it from a transcript sent me by my  esteemed friend Dr. Reinhart Dozy, of Leyden.   “Don Pedro and Don Juan [el Tuerto], two Infantes of Castile, came here lately at the head of a for-  “‘ midable army, such as the Moslems never saw before, with the determination of taking possession of  “‘Granada. Their first halt was near a castle called ye Tiscar, which they besieged. The governor,  “‘ whose name was Ibn Hamdiin, offered to capitulate on condition that his life and those of the Moslems  “‘ with him should be spared. The Christian Infantes having agreed to these conditions, it was resolved  “ that the Christians should occupy the castle, together with the Moslems. Ibn Hamdiin promised, if they  * sent him a body of five hundred men, to admit them into the fortress. When night came on, the Infantes,  “ according to their promise, sent to the castle a body of five hundred horsemen, under the command of a  “ captain named ANT Arfand; but they had no sooner gained admittance into the castle than they were  “' scattered about the various rooms of the fortress and massacred, without their being able to assist each  “other. When the King of Castile heard of the treason practised upon his men, he took a most solemn  “« oath not to return to his dominions until he had taken possession of Granada by force of arms. He  “accordingly encamped about four miles from the city, but as no one went out against him, he struck  “his tents and advanced two miles further. When the Moslems saw this formidable host approach the  ‘« city, fear lodged in their hearts, and they began to address the most fervent prayers to God for their  “deliverance. The Sultan of Granada, seeing the fear and consternation of his subjects, sent a message  “‘to the Christian, saying, ‘Return to thy dominions without doing harm to the fields, and I will give  “ thee twenty loads of money.’ But the Christian refused the offer, saying, ‘ Nothing will deter me from  “ besieging thy capital until I take it.’ The Sultén then sent him a second message, offering twenty-five",573,,

[Book vii1.  “* loads of gold, besides one hundred dinars daily, and one thousand every Friday ; but the Christian king  “ returned the same answer, and, moreover, put the Moslem ambassador in irons. This convinced the  ‘* Moslems that nothing could save them except their own fortitude and the Almighty’s help, and they  “ accordingly made every preparation to meet the impending danger. Having sent to implore the aid of  “an Amir named Abi-l-jiyish, he hastened to their assistance with a body of one thousand horse. Mean-  “‘ while Abd Sa’fd ’Othmén Ibn Al-’ala, who commanded the troops of Granada, was preparing to march  “against the enemy. After directing the Amir Abd-l-jiydsh to lay in ambush with his men in a spot  ‘‘ which he pointed out to them, he himself left Granada at the head of his forces. ’Othm4n was shortly  “* after followed by the Sultén, after whom came an Amir named Al-maghr4wi, with three hundred horse  “‘ of the Beni Merin. Each of these divisions went along, trumpet sounding and cymbals beating, until  “ they came in sight of the Christians, whom they deliberately charged. Soon after, however,—as pre-  “ concerted between them,—the Moslems gave way and fled towards the city, being closely pursued  “by the Franks; but they had no sooner arrived at the spot where their friends were concealed, than  “‘ they turned round and fought, when, those in ambush coming out, they gave their war-cry, and rushed  “* upon the enemy, who, being taken by surprise, was completely routed,” &c.    % By Bdbd the author means, no doubt, the Archbishop of Toledo, through whose interference the  Pope is said to have granted to the Infante Don Pedro the tithes of all the churches of Spain, to cover  the expenses of the war against the Moors.    2% Sheykhu-l-ghozdt, or ‘‘ Sheikh of the warriors,” was the title given to the general of the African  troops in the service of the kings of Granada. It was one of the highest dignities at court, and was  never conferred except upon members of the royal family of the Beni ’Abdi-l-hakk or Beni Merin, who  were then reigning over Fez and Morocco.    26 An-nuwayri (loco laudato, fo. 112) also says that Don Pedro came accompanied by twenty-five  princes, among whom were, his uncle Don Juan, the Lord of diye] Ossuna (or igus Lisbon), the Lord  of Castile, the Lord of sl Ilkirinterrah (England), the Lord of Aragon, and the Lord of Bulle  Talavera, and others, all of whom remained on the field of battle.    % The date given by Ibnu-l-khattfb agrees with the Christian accounts, which place the battle two  days after the festival of St. John. The Spanish chroniclers will not allow that the body of the Infante  Don Pedro was so indignantly treated. They say that it was carried off by his own men, and interred in  the monastery of Las Huelgas en Burgos. See Nuiez de Villasan, Cronica de Don Alonso XI., cap. xviii.  As to that of Don Juan, it was afterwards given up on the payment of a large ransom, owing, it is said,    to his having once befriended the Moslems — _ sun! po vw    Bytom FS bil Bad all IIL ceyy",574,,

Mariana calls him Abomilique (Abii Mélik). He crossed over to Spain before his father, and took  Gibraltar. Having subsequently made an incursion into Andalusia, he was killed in battle with the  Christians. See Villasan, Cronica de Alfonso el Onceno, cap. cxiii., and Mariana, Hist. Gen. de Espaha,  lib. xvr. cap. ii.    2 The buildings erected by order of Abi-l-hasan at Gibraltar are very minutely described by Ibn  Battiittah in his original travels. That author, who visited Spain in a.#. 750, under the reign of Abi  ""Inén Féris, the son of Abu-l-hasan, enters into many interesting details upon the campaigns of the  Merinite Sulténs against the Christians of Spain. Compare the Karttds, translated by Moura, and Conde,  Hist. de la Dom. vol. iii. cap. xii.    3 According to the author of the Holalu-/-maushiyyah, this villa was erected by Idris Al-mémin,  Sultén of the Almohades, during his residence in Malaga, before he took possession of the throne. Sid  or Seyd being the title generally given to the princes of the Almohades, the villa was called Mun'yat  As-seyd. There was another villa of the same name in the outskirts of Granada, a city which, according  to Ibnu-l-khattib, owed its principal buildings to its Almohade governors. The author of the Reyhdau-l-  lebdb wa rey’dnu-sh-shebib says that ’Abdu-l-wahed I., seventh Sultén of the Almohades, whilst he was  governor of Granada, and before he succeeded his father on the throne, built a magnificent palace known  as Kasr ’Abdi-l-wdhed, or the palace of ’Abdu-l-wéhed, as well as a delightful villa called Ddru-l-beydhd,  or the white house.    4 slaw . edls—now called “ Rio de la miel.”  ge oh    5 Mariana, on the authority of a register-book kept in the archives of the cathedral of Toledo, places  this battle on the 30th of October.    § Abi-l-késim Ibn Sherif is the same individual mentioned in vol. i. p. 404, note 6, of this translation.  He was one of the masters of Ibnu-l-khattfb, who devotes to him a long article in his biographical  dictionary of illustrious Granadians. His full name was Abii-l-késim Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibn  Mohammed Al-hasani As-sebti; but he was better known by the surname of Ash-sherif or Ibn Sherif  (the son of the Sherif), because he was descended in a straight line from Al-hasan, one of the sons  of ’Ali Ibn Abi Talib. He was born at Ceuta in Rabi’ the first, a. a. 697 (Jan. a. p. 1298), but went to  Granada, where he obtained office under the government, and, in a. a. 737, was appointed Kédi-]-kodé  or supreme judge. In Sha’bén, 747, he was superseded, but soon after, upon the accession to the throne  of Mohammed V., the eighth of the Beni Nasr, he was restored to his office, which he filled till his  death. According to my copy of Ibnu-l-khattib, this happened in Sha’ban, 760 (July, a.p. 1359);  which must be a mistake, since the revolution at Granada happened one month after, in Ramadhan, and  Abi-1-k4sim himself is said to have gone to Granada as an ambassador of Abd Sélim.

This palace, which is no other than the famous Generalife at Granada, is still existing, though    much dilapidated.    13 Casiri (vol. ii. p. 317), and Conde (vol. iii. p. 152) after him, call this Sultan Abd Sa’id. In the  extract from Ibnu Khaldtin given at p. 357, Isma’il’s relative and supporter is also named Abii Sa’id; yet  in no part of his work does Ibnu-l-khattib call him so.

See  above, note 13.   Mohammed was succeeded by. his son Yusuf III., between whom and Abu-l-hasan ’Ali, the next  sovereign mentioned by Al-makkari, several princes occupied the throne of Granada. This gap in the  history of the last Mohammedan kingdom in the Peninsula is the more to be regretted, as it can only be  supplied by the writings of the Arabs, the Spanish chroniclers of the time not being either accurate  or explicit enough to allow us to establish the chronology with any certainty. The work of Conde,  it is true, affords greater materials; but as this portion of his history, though studiously shaped so as to  give it an Arabic appearance, is evidently founded on Christian authorities,—there not being in the  Escurial any work on the history of Mohammedan Spain later than that of Ibnu-l-khattib,—great  precaution is to be used in adopting his statements. For this reason I have avoided giving in the  Chronological Table (No. XX.), at the end of the volume, the dates of the reigns of the seven Sultans  who, according to Conde, occupied the throne of Granada in the interval between the death of Yusuf IT.  and the accession of Abi-l-hasan, or Alboacen, as the Spanish chroniclers of the time write his name.

Mariana, on what authority it would be in vain to inquire, says that Abu-l-hasan (whom he  calls Alboacen) was assassinated at Almufiecar by the command of his own brother, Az-zaghal ; but little  credit is to be given to the statements of a writer who invariably confounds Az-zaghal and Abt ’Abdillah,  calling them indistinctly Albohardil and Boabdil. See Prescott, Ferdinand and Isabella, chap. x.    7 This was, no doubt, the battle of Lopera, in which the Moslems were defeated by the Andalusian  borderers ; but what is here meant by the chiefs of ‘‘ Western Andalus” it is not easy to say, the  Moorish kingdom being then too circumscribed to admit of such division. The author perhaps means  those districts to the west of Malaga which were then called Alyarbia or western; as those to the east  were called Ararquia or eastern.    18 Probably the castle of Moclin, before which the Christians, commanded by the Count of Cabra,  suffered a signal defeat.

His cousin’s name being also  Abt ‘Abdillah Mohammed, they have frequently been confounded by the Christian chroniclers. The  latter, however, is more generally known as Boabdil, a corruption from Abii ’Abdillah, or ef Rey chico  (the little king), to distinguish him from his uncle Az-zaghal. Marmol (Rebelion, &c., fo. 15) says that  his people gave him the surname of Zogoybi, that is, the unfortunate. He appears also to have assumed,  upon his accession to the throne, the title of Al-kadir-billah. See Mariana, Hist. Gen. de Espaiia,  lib. xxv. cap. ii.   Here follows in the original manuscript, but not in the abridgement, a long risdleh or epistle, written  partly in prose and partly in verse, by Abii ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Al-’arabi Al-’okayli, the  secretary of Boabdil (Abt ’Abdillah), the last King of Granada, and addressed, in his master’s name, to  the Sheikh [Sa’id] Al-watdsi, Sultén of Fez, and founder of the dynasty of the Beni Al-watés. The    ’  risdleh, entitled us lan pte! x! Pe augill Aad wl poll! 4 yy (the gardens of  odoriferous flowers, or the message to the Lord and Imdm the Sultdn of Fez), is written in that highly  figurative style so much to the taste of the Arabs, and relates the last events of the war of Granada and  the taking of that capital by Ferdinand; it begins thus:    pel ape cert ihe md be, pel g Col ye SMI dye  pie ype cle yal ed ol lel pd yg Gal ay  pinks in phd See LB yt Opel pie AU pe pho    “ O Lord of kings! the kings of the Arabs and foreigners; thou art a talisman to thy equals,  « whom thou preservest from injury and shame.   “To thee we run for assistance; for thou art the refuge of those whom Fortune assails with her  “« vindictive blows.   “In Allah’s name thou pronouncest sentence, except on cases to him reserved; and who can  “ complain of thy justice?”   After the above poetical composition, which consists of several hundred verses intermixed with rhymed  prose, begins the second part of the work, which, as I have stated in the Preface (p. xiv.), is also divided  into eight books, and contains the biography of the celebrated Wizir Abii ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn  *Abdillah Ibn Sa’id Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Sa’id Ibn ’Ali Ibn Ahmed As-salmani Al-lishi, better known  by the surname of Ibnu-l-khattib, and the honourable appellation of Lisdnu-d-din or “tongue of the  faith.”   Book the first treats of his birth and ancestors. Ibnu-l-khattib was a native of Granada, but his  ancestors were originally from Cordova, where they lived in considerable affluence. Having taken an active  part in the rebellion of the southern suburb of Cordova against Al-hakem I. in a. H. 202 (a. p. 818), they  were obliged, like thousands of other families, to seek shelter elsewhere, and retire to Toledo, where they  resided until the occupation of that city by Alfonso VI. of Leon in a. #. 478 (a. p. 1085). From Toledo  the ancestors of Ibnu-l-khattib withdrew to the districts inhabited by Moslems, and fixed their residence  in various parts of the kingdom of Granada and Jaen. One of them, named ’Abdu-r-rahman, became  Kadi of a district called Beghah, in the province of Jaen; another, named Sa’id, took up his abode in  Liishah (Loxa), and was appointed Khattib or preacher to its mosque. From this Sa’id are descended  the Beni Al-khattib of Loxa. Sa’id had a son named Abdullah, who was killed at the battle of Tarifa, on  Monday, the 7th of Jum4da 1. of the year 741, and who was the father of Lis4nu-d-din.",581,,

"    APPENDIX.    Extracts from the historical work entitled “Traditions of Commandment and Government,”  relating to the murder of ’Abdu-laztz. See vol. i. App. E. p. lL. et seg.    How ’Abdu-l’aziz, son of Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, was put to death in Andalus by order of the  Khalif Suleyman.    The historian says,—And they relate, on the authority of Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek,  that Musa remained at the court of Suleymén, imploring his forgiveness, until that Sultan  granted him a complete pardon, which he also extended to his two sons, ’Abdullah  and ’Abdu-l-’aziz; suffering the former to retain the government of Eastern Africa, Tangiers,  and Stis, and the latter that of Andalus, as previously agreed between him and Misa. How-  ever, when ’Abdu-l-’aziz heard of Suleym4n’s treatment of his father, he began to speak  slightingly of his sovereign, and showed on every occasion his resentment of the injuries  inflicted on him. This being reported to Suleyman, that Sultan conceived fears that ’Abdu-l-  ’aziz_ might shake off his allegiance and revolt against him. He therefore wrote to Habib  Ibn Abi ’Obeydah, Ibn Wa’lah At-temim{, Sa’id Ibn ’Othmén Ibn Yasir, ’Amru Ibn Miimelah  Al-yahssobi, Omar Ibn Kethir, and Omar Ibn Sharéhib, all of whom were superior officers  in the African army, telling them what he had heard respecting ’Abdu-l-’aziz, and how he  had been told of his meditating a revolt. He likewise apprised them how he had written  to ’Abdullah Ibn Mitisa, commanding him to send every one of them to ’Abdu-l-’aziz in  Andalus, and telling him not to wonder if he thus deprived him of the best officers in  his army, as they were very much wanted on the opposite land, where there were more  enemies to encounter. At the same time, Suleyman issued to each of the above-mentioned  individuals secret instructions commanding ’Abdu-l-’aziz to be put to death, and promising that  whoever would execute the deed should be appointed his successor. To Abdullah he wrote  in these terms: “ The Commander of the Faithful perceives that thy ‘brother, ’Abdu-l-’aziz,  “has in front of him an enemy against whom all possible courage and energy must needs  “be displayed. He has inquired, and he has been told that thou hast under thy orders  “many men of that description, such as so and so, and so and so; send them all to thy  “ brother, ’Abdu-l-’aziz, in Andalus, that he may employ them against the common enemy.”",585,,
"    iv APPENDIX.    To ’Abdu-l-’aziz, moreover, he wrote as follows: “ The Commander of the Faithful has been  “ informed of the class of enemies thou hast to contend with, and the want in which thou art  “ of men of courage and experience: knowing, therefore, that there are now in Eastern  “ Africa, at the orders of thy brother ’Abdullah, some men of that description, he has  “written to him to dispatch them to thee, that thou mayst give them command in thy  “ armies, and appoint them to posts of trust near thy person or on the frontiers.” Another  letter was then issued to the conspirators, saying, “I have sent you written orders  “ enjoining the people of Andalus to obey you in all cases, and absolving you from the  “death of ’Abdu-l-’aziz. These letters you are to read, wherever you may be, to all the  “ Moslems under your orders, that they may all know and understand what my wishes and  “ commands are; and when you have made yourselves a party sufficiently strong among the  “ soldiers, you shall rise and put to death ’Abdu-l-’aziz, if such be the will of God, and then  “ return.”   When ’Abdullah, the governor of Eastern Africa, received the above letter from the Khalif,  he hastened to comply with his orders, and immediately prepared for the departure for Andalus  of the men named in the dispatch, who had no sooner arrived and presented their credentials  to ’Abdu-l’aziz, than they were most kindly received and hospitably entertained by that  governor, who told them to choose the provinces of his government wherein they preferred  to settle, or the frontiers whereon they wished to be employed. The conspirators then held  counsel together, when one of them rose and said, “ If the orders of the Commander of the  “ Faithful are to be fulfilled, you cannot accept of the proposition of ’Abdu-l-’aziz ; for if each of  “ you go first to the station allotted to him, and then return here, I apprehend you will  “ never be able to accomplish what is required from you: the army is mostly in his favour;  “he has plenty of money, great power, and numerous maulis and adherents attached to his  “person. I think our best plan is to remain here, and get rid of him secretly: there are  “ many men in this place (Seville), who, were they to lend a hand to this enterprise, would  “insure its success: one is Aytb Ibn Habib, the son of Miisa’s sister; I advise you to see  “him, and communicate to him the Khalif’s instructions.” This plan being agreed upon as  the most expedient, the delegates went to see Aytib, and offered him, in the Khalifs name,  the government of Andalus if he would assist them in their undertaking. Aydb having  consented to kill ""Abdu-l~’aziz on this condition, they promised him their allegiance in case  of success. The delegates went next to ’Abdullah Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman Al-ghéfeki, who was  the most eminent and most conspicuous person in the army, by his talents, his generosity,  and his virtues : -having read in his presence the letters of Suleyman, they discovered to him all  their plans: Abdullah, however, would not be a party to the murder of ’Abdu-l-’aziz; on the  contrary, he said to them, “ You know that the hand of Misa has conferred benefits on every  “ one of you, great or small. If the Commander of the Faithful has been informed as you  “ represent, he has been told a lie. *Abdu-l-’aziz has never raised his hand in disobedience  “to his: master, nor dreamt of revolting against him. The Khalif, at the distance he is,  “ cannot see whether ’Abdu-l’aziz is guilty or innocent of the crime imputed to him ; but you  “ can, and it is for you to decide whether he deserves death, or not. Follow my advice; give  “up your purpose, and write to the Khalif that you cannot put his orders into execution.”",586,,
"    APPENDIX. v    The delegates, however, disregarded his words for the love of the Sultén, and went about  their business. Some time afterwards, they again met together and decided upon his death,  which they accomplished in the following manner. They stood at the gate of his palace,  waiting till he should go to the mosque to attend morning prayers. ’Abdu-l-’aziz left his  palace at dawn of day, bent his steps towards the mosque, entered the kid/ah, and began to  read the Korén. Scarcely had he finished reading the introductory chapter, when, lo! a great  noise and confusion was suddenly heard, and one of the conspirators, Ibn Abi ’Obeydah (Habfb),  rushed upon ’Abdu-l-’aziz and struck him a blow, which, however, took no effect. The  service was interrupted; and ’Abdu-l-’aziz, leaving the kiblah where he was, took refuge in  the body of the mosque: he was followed thither by Ibn Wa’lah At-temimi, who killed him.  When the news of the death of ’Abdu-l-’aziz spread through the city, the inhabitants were greatly  astonished and displeased: the conspirators then produced the letters and the orders received  from the Khalif Suleyman, but to no purpose; the people would not attend to them, and  they chose ’Abdullah Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Al-ghéfeki to be his successor. In the mean  time Habib Ibn Abi ’Obeydah and his comrades marched to Damascus with the head of  *Abdu-l-’aziz, son of Miisa. But we have reached the end of our narrative. God be praised  for it!    How the head of ’Abdu-l-’azfz was brought to Suleyman.    The author of the tradition says,— When Suleymén thought that the messengers sent by  him to Andalus had reached their destination, and executed his commands, he proceeded to  remove ’Abdullah Ibn Musa from his government of Eastern Africa, Stis, and Tangiers. This  took place towards the end of the year 98 of the Hijra, in the month of Dhi-l-hajjah (July  or August, A.D. 717). Habib and his companions then came to Damascus, and placed  the head of ’Abdu-l-’aziz before the Khalif Suleyman, who sent immediately for Musa.  Having appeared in his presence, and being made to sit behind the people, Suleyman pointed  to the head, and said to Muisa, “ Dost thou know whose head that is?”—‘“ Yes,” answered  Misa, “I do; that is the head of my son ’Abdu-l-aziz.” The messengers then rose and  informed the Khalif of what they had done in Andalus for the execution of his orders.  Hearing which, Musa got up, and, after praising God, said, “ O Commander of the Faithful !  “thou art revenged; the head of ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Muisa (may God show him mercy!) is  “ before thee, but by the life of God there never was a Moslem who less deserved such unjust  “ treatment; for he passed his days in fasting, and his nights in prayer; no man ever more  “loved his God, or his messenger Mohammed; no man ever performed greater deeds to  “ serve the cause of the Almighty, or was more firm in his obedience to thee, or showed  “a milder disposition towards the men under his orders. ’Abdu-l-’aziz is no more; (may  “ God forgive him his sins!) for, by Allah! he was neither avaricious of life, nor fearful  “ of death. None of thy predecessors,—neither ’Abdu-l-malek, nor ’Abdu-l-’aziz, nor even Al-  “ walid,—would have treated him thus, or reduced him to this plight. Thou even wouldst  “ never have done what God saw thee do with him, had there been any justice in thee. They  “ were all exceedingly pleased and satisfied with him, well knowing his honesty and his  “ virtues; and were therefore incapable of behaving thus to him merely upon the strength of",587,,
"    vi APPENDIX.    “ false reports.” Suleyman then said, “ Thou liest, O Misa! thy son, *Abdu-l~aziz, was  * not as thou representest him; on the contrary, he was impious and forgetful of his religion ;  “he was the persecutor of the Moslems, and the sworn enemy of his sovereign, the Com-  “ mander of the Faithful. Such was thy son, O foolish and doting old man! not as  thou describest him.” Misa then replied, “ By Allah! I am no dotard, nor would I  ‘ knowingly deviate from truth, wert thou to answer every one of my words with the blows of  “death. I speak as the honest slave ought to speak to his master, with submission and  “ respect, bearing the insult without retorting it; but I place my confidence in God, whose  “ help I implore, and beseech Grant me his head, O Commander of the Faithful! that  “T may shut the lids of his eyes.” And Suleyman said to him, “ Thou mayst take it.”  Miisa then rose from his seat, and, taking the head of his son ’Abdu-l-’azfz, placed it in  a corner of the tunic he had on; he then folded it twice backwards, in doing which  the other end of his vest came off his shoulders. Musa was going out of the room in  this manner, without either noticing or trying to repair the disorder in his dress, when  Khéled Ibnu-r-rayaén, having noticed it, came up to him and said, “ Take up that garment  of thine, O son of Nosseyr!” but Musa, turning round towards him, replied (ironically)  in these words,— This is no doubt a proof of the great love thou bearest to me, O Khiled !”  Suleymén then interfered, and said to the latter, “ Let Muisa alone; he has already been  “ sufficiently punished ;” and when Musa left the room he added, “ That old man’s spirit is  “ still unbroken.” They say, that as Misa was quitting the palace he met Habib Ibn Abi  *Obeydah, to whom he addressed abusive words before all present, disclosing at the same time  some shameful circumstances respecting his family, unknown to all but himself, and  which cast no small discredit upon the person of that officer.   Some time after these events, Suleyman having made inquiries respecting the case of  *Abdu-l-’aziz, found out that all the reports respecting him were unfounded, and that ’Abdu-l-  ’aziz had never swerved from his obedience, nor done any other reprehensible act; on the  contrary, he had been throughout his life a model of virtue. When the Khalif saw this  he repented of what he had done, and, being angry with Habib and the other messengers, he  caused them to be banished the capital, and entirely disregarded their petitions. He then  remitted to Musa the payment of the remainder of the fine.         An account of the governors of Andalus after Misa and his son’ Abdu-I-’aziz.    The author says,—And they relate that ’Abdu-l~’aziz Ibn Miisa governed Andalus one year  after the departure of his father, after which he was put to death, as before said, by the order  of the Khalif Suleyman. He was succeeded by Aytib Ibn Habib Al-lakhmi, who governed six  months ; then came Al-horr Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman Ath-thakefi, for three years. After him, As-  samh Ibn Malik Al-khauldni, who ruled for three years and a half; then ’Anbasah (Ibn Sohéym  Al-kelbi), two years and nine months. After him, Yahya Ibn Salmah, one year and three  months. After him, Hodeyfah Ibnu-l-ahwass, siz months. After him, ’Othmén Ibn Abi  Nes’ah Al-khath’am{, siz months. After him, Al-haytham Ibn ’Obeyd, one year and two  months. Then ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn ’Abdillah Al-ghéfeki, four years. Then *Abdu-l-malek",588,,
"    APPENDIX. vii    Ibn Kattan Al-korashi, four years. Then ’Okbah Ibn Hejaj (As-seluli), five years and three  months. Then ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Kattan, for the second time, one year. After him, Balh  (Balj) Ibn Beshr Al-kusheyri, six months. Then Tha’lebah Ibn Sel4mah, five months. Then  Abiu-l-khattér Ibn Dherér Al-kelbi, three years. Then Thudbah Ibn Salmah, one year and  one month, Then came the overthrow of the dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah in the East,  when the people of Andalus chose for their commander Yusuf Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Al-korashi  Al-fehri, without any order or sealed letters from the Khalif to that effect. Yvisuf governed  Andalus for fen years, until the arrival of ’Abdu-r-rahmén, son of Mua’wiyah, son of Hishém,  son of ’Abdu-l-malek, son of Merwén, son of Abi-l-’4ssi, son of Umeyyah, son of ’Abdu-  sh-shems, son of ’Abdu-Menéf, who took the command of the country out of his hands.    How the massacre of the Beni Umeyyah came to pass.    The author says,—And they relate that after the death of Merwén, the last Khalif of the  house of Umeyyah, As-sefféh gave orders to his lieutenants in Syria and Egypt to look for  the surviving members of that family, and put them to death. Accordingly, ""Abdullah Ibn  ’Ali, who was governor of Philistin (Palestine), began to give out that his intentions were  good, and that he came to pardon the Beni Umeyyah in the Khalif’s name, and to restore  them to the possession of all their property and honours. On the faith of these promises,  about eighty-three of the most illustrious and principal members of that unfortunate family,  amongst whom were ’Abdu-l-wahed Ibn Suleymén Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, Yahya Ibn Mu’awiyah,  Abén Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz, and ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Mu’awiyah Ibn Hishém, surrendered  themselves. It happened, however, that the latter, who became afterwards king of  Andalus, met on his way to the governor’s a man whom he had patronised and esteemed  in former times, and who, stopping him, addressed him in the following words: “ Obey  “me to-day, and oppose me if thou wilt on the day of judgment.” ’Abdu-r-rahmén  replied, “In what am I to obey thee?”—“Away! away!” said the man; “ fly to the  “ West, where a kingdom awaits thee; for all this is a treason prepared by As-sefféh, who  “ wishes to rid himself in one blow of all the Beni Umeyyah.”—“ How can that be?” replied  *Abdu-r-rahmén, “ when the governor has received his letters commanding him to assemble  “ us, to restore us our property, and to grant us besides plentiful pensions and bounteous gifts ?”  — Do not be led away by these signs of peace and pardon,” said the man; “ for, believe me,  “ never will the Beni ’Abbés consider themselves fully in possession of the throne, never will  “ they deem themselves secure, as long as the eyes of one of the Beni Umeyyah remain  * open.”—“ And what shall I get,” replied ’Abdu-r-rahmén, “ by following thy advice ?”—  “ Uncover thy back, that I may see thy shoulders; for, if I am not mistaken, thou art the  “ man for whom the kingdom of Andalus is destined.” And on ’Abdu-r-rahmén uncovering  his shoulders, as he was desired, the man saw on one of them the mark alluded to in the  Kitdbu-l-hodthdn (the book of the future events), which was an immense black mole, rising on  his back. “ Away! away!” repeated the man; “ go to the West, and I will accompany thee  “ part of the way: I have twenty thousand dindrs; I will bring them to this spot, and thou  “ shalt depart.”—“ Who gave thee that money?” inquired ’Abdu-r-rahmén. “ Thy uncle,",589,,
"    viii APPENDIX.    “Moslemah Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek,” answered the man. Upon which the prince, starting,  said, “ By Allah! thou sayst the truth, man; for I recollect now, that when I was a child,  “ my uncle, Moslemah, who on my father’s death took care of my infancy, one day unco-  . © vered my shoulders, and saw the mark thou speakest of, when he began to weep profusely.  “ We were then, my uncle and I, before my grandfather, the Khalif Hishém, who no sooner  “saw my uncle’s sudden affliction, than he inquired the cause of it.” Moslemah then  said, “ O Commander of the Faithful! this orphan will live to be king of the West,  “after the overthrow of our empire in the East.”—“ And why shouldst thou weep,  “O Abi Sa’id!” replied my grandfather. “I do not weep on account of that; but,  “by Allah! I weep because of the women and children of the Beni Umeyyah, whose gold  “ and silver necklaces shall be converted into so many iron collars, whose sweet perfumes,  “ aromatic woods, and odoriferous ointments, shall make room for nauseous smells and the  “ coarsest brush-wood. But God is over all things: after prosperity and glory, humiliation  “and misfortune generally succeed.” . . . . . . . . . .  (The author goes on to relate the massacre of the Beni Umeyyah, ninety of whom were barbarously  butchered after a banquet to which they had been invited by the governor.]              APPENDIX B.    Extracts from the Jadh'watu-l-muktabis ft Tértkhi rejdli-l-andalus (a sparkle of fire from the  steel on the history of the illustrious men of Andalus), by Abi’ Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Abt  Nasr Fath Ibn ’Abdillah Al-azdi Al-homaydt, of Cordova.' (Bibl. Bodl. Hunt. 464.)    Reign of Mohammed, son of Hishim, surnamed Al-muhdi.    This Mohammed, who was the son of Hishdém, son of ’Abdu-l-jabbér, son of ’Abdu-r-  rahmén An-nasir, rose against Hishém, son of Al-hakem, and deposed him in the month  of Jumdda 11. of the year 399 (Feb. a. p. 1009), assuming the title of Al-muhdi (the directed).  He continued thus in undisturbed possession of the empire till Thursday the fifth of  Shawwl of the same year (June 2, a.p. 1009), when Hishém, son of Suleyman, son of [’Abdu-  r-rahman] An-ndsir, revolted against him in Cordova with the Berbers. After fighting in  the streets of the city the remainder of that day, the whole of the night, and part of the next  morning, the inhabitants took the part of Mohammed, and the Berbers were routed and         1 For an account of this author and his various works, see Vol. i. Preface, p. xx. and pp. 193, 473. Deceived by the similarity  of the title and the general appearance of the manuscript, I there hazarded the conjecture that Al-homayd/’s work was an  abridgment of a voluminous history of Mohammedan Spain, which Abi Merwin Ibn Hayy&n wrote under the title of Al-muktabis  Si Tarikhi rejdli-l-andalus ; but, although the facts of this latter work having been composed at least thirty years before the  former, and of Al-homaydi being a disciple of Ibnu Hayyan, seemed to favour the supposition, I have, upon closer investigation,  discovered that the work of Al-homaydi, from which the following extracts are taken, has nothing in common with the more  voluminous history written by the celebrated Abi Merwan Hayyan Ibn Khalf Ibn Huseyn Ibn Hayy4n, of Cordova.",590,,
"    APPENDIX. ix    compelled to leave the city. Hishém was, moreover, made a prisoner, and brought to the  presence of Mohammed, who beheaded him with his own hand.   After this defeat the Berbers, having united their council, appqinted a nephew of the  deceased, whose name was Suleymén, to command over them. Suleyman was the son of  Al-hakem, son of Suleymdn, son of [?Abdu-r-rahmén] An-ndsir. Immediately after his  appointment he retired with the Berbers into the Thagher, whence, reinforced with Christian  troops, he soon after returned to Cordova, and laid siege to it. On the appearance of  the Berbers before the walls, part of the garrison and the inhabitants sallied out against the  enemy ; but they were unsuccessful, and repulsed with the loss of upwards of twenty thousand  of their number. This disastrous battle, which was fought near a mountain there called  Kantish,? has become celebrated in history for the number of eminent men,—poets, historians,  theologians, Iméms, Almuezzins, and others,—who perished in it. Mohammed Ibn Hishém  Al-muhdi, however, escaped from the swords of the Berbers, and, after remaining a few days  in concealment, succeeded in reaching Toledo, as the whole of the Thaghers,> from Tortosa  down to Lisbon, had remained faithful to him and obeyed his sway. Having therefore  collected an army in those provinces, and obtained the assistance of the Franks, Al-muhdi  returned with them to Cordova. Suleyman sallied out against him with his Berbers; and the  two hosts having met at a spot, some ten miles from Cordova, known as the ’Akbatu-l-bakar  (the defile of the cows), Suleyman and the Berbers were completely defeated and put to rout.  Al-muhdi, moreover, marched upon Cordova, and took possession of it. He then went out in  pursuit of the Berbers, who had marched in the direction of Algesiras. Having overtaken  them close to the river Aro* (Guadiaro), Mohammed gave them battle. He was however  defeated, and compelled to fall back upon Cordova; where, no sooner had he arrived, than  some of his own slaves, with Wadeh the Sclavonian at their head, fell suddenly upon him and  put him to death, appointing in his stead Hisham Al-muyyed, whom they brought out (of his  concealment), as elsewhere related. The reign of Mohammed Ibn Hishdm had lasted ten  months, counting from the day of his usurpation till that of his death, and including also the  six months that his rival Suleyman was in possession of Cordova, whilst he himself was in  the Thagher. His appellative surname was Abi-l-walid. His mother’s name was Muznah.  He left one son named ’Obeydullah, who died without posterity. Al-muhdi was born in the  year 366 (beginning Aug. 29, a. D. 976).    Reign of Suleyman Ibn Al-hakem Al-musta’in.    Suleyman Ibn Al-hakem rose, as related, on Friday the 6th of Shawwél of the year  399 (September 4, a.p. 1008), when he assumed the appellation of Al-musta’in-billah  (he who beseeches the help of God). After this he entered Cordova, as above related, in  the month of Rabi’ 11. of the year 400 (November or December, A. p. 1009), when, in addi-  tion to that of Al-musta’in, he took the surname of Adh-dhifir bihaul-illah (the victorious by         ce oF  2 malas ree 3 Namely, the upper, the lower, and the central.

"    x APPENDIX.    the will of God). He then left Cordova in Shawwél of the year 400 (May or June, a.p.  1010), and lost, as before stated, the battle of Jebal-kantish. From that time, however,  Suleym4n and his Berbers never ceased marching through the provinces of Andalus, laying  waste the fields, destroying and plundering the cities and the villages, insulting the women,  putting the men to the sword, and committing all sorts of atrocities, until they gained  possession of Cordova a second time, at the beginning of Shawwél of the year 403 (April,  A.D. 1013).   There were among the officers of Suleyman’s army two men of the posterity of Al-hasan  Ibn ’Alf Ibn Abi Talib; their names were Al-kdésim and ’Ali, and both were the sons of  Hamid, son of Maymiin, son of Ahmed, son of ’Ali, son of *Obeydullah, son of *Omar, son  of Idris, son of ’Abdullah, son of Al-hasan (son of Al-hasan), son of Alf, son of Abf Talib:  (may God be propitious to them all!). On his first accession to power, Suleyman had given.  them the command of the African troops. He had afterwards appointed Al-k4sim, the eldest,  to the government of Jezfratu-l-khadhrd (Algesiras), and had given to ’Ali that of Ceuta and  Tangiers. Algesiras is a sea-port in the strait, known as the Bahru-z-zokdk (the narrow sea),  where the distance from one shore to another is no more than twelve miles. But to return.   When Suleymfn, with his Berbers, made his second entry into Cordova, the slaves’ spread  over the country and gained possession of some principal cities, where they fortified them-  selves. In order to reduce them, Suleymén sent an army at the orders of ’Ali Ibn Hamid,  before mentioned, who, being an ambitious man, and thinking the opportunity a favourable  one, conceived the project of making himself the master of Andalus. He accordingly entered  into a secret correspondence with the very slaves against whom he was sent, and made them  believe that whilst Hishém Ibn Al-hakem was besieged in Cordova, that Khalif had written  to him, appointing him his successor to the throne in case he should be put to death by  Suleym&én. Deceived by these declarations, the slaves answered his call, and proclaimed him  as sovereign of Andalus. ’Ali then sailed from Ceuta and landed at Malaga, the governor of  which, ’A’mir Ibn Fatih Al-féyiki, who was a freed slave of Fayik, a freed man of Al-hakem  Al-mustanser, acknowledged his right to the empire, and gave him entrance into the city,  where ’Ali Ibn Hamid was immediately proclaimed by the troops and the inhabitants.  Some time afterwards, however, ’Alf expelled ’A’mir Ibn Fatih, and remained sole master of  Malaga. ’Ali then marched to Cordova with the Berbers who followed his banners, and the  whole of the slaves. He was met by Mohammed, the son of Suleyman, who, by his father’s  orders, sallied out of Cordova at the head of the Berber troops: Mohammed, however, was  defeated; and ’Ali having gained possession of Cordova, Suleyman was seized and put to  death by the usurper, who beheaded him with his own hand, on a Sunday, nine days before  the end of Moharram of the year 407 (June 30, a.p. 1016). ’Ali put also to death on the  same day Al-hakem [Ibn Suleyman] Ibn An-nésir, Suleymén’s father, an old man of seventy-  two years of age. Suleymén had reigned three years, three months, and a few days, counting  from the day he entered Cordova to the time of his death. He had, however, been previously         * uc The author no doubt means Khayrdn, Mujéhid, Zohayr, and others who had been slaves of the Beni Umeyyah,  and once formed part of the Sclavonian guard.",592,,
"    APPENDIX. xi    in possession of that capital for six months; so that if we calculate the duration of his reign  since the day he rose with the Berbers until he was killed, we shall find it seven years, three  months, and some days. By the death of Suleyman the rule of the Beni Umeyyah was  momentarily suspended, as well as the mention of their names from the pulpits of the  mosques, in the whole of Andalus, until it was afterwards restored to its primitive state, as  we shall hereafter relate. Suleyman’s mother was called Dhab’yah.® He was born in the  year 354 (beginning January 6, a.p. 965). He left three sons; Mohammed, who afterwards  filled the throne of Andalus, but died without issue; Al-walid, and Moslemah. Suleyman was  a friend to poets and literary men, and could write very fine verses himself.”    Reign of ’ Ali Ibn Hamid, surnamed An-ndasir.    On his accession to the Khalifate, ’Alf assumed the surname of An-ndsir (the defender).  Soon after this, however, the slaves who had proclaimed him resisted his authority, and  appointed in his room ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn ’Abdi-r-  rahmén An-ndsir, to whom they gave the honorary surname of Al-murtadhi (the accepted),  marching with him to Granada, one of the cities which, as above stated, had fallen into  the hands of the Berbers. *Abdu-r-rahmén’s elevation did not last long; for the same people  who had raised him to power, perceiving his determination to punish all infractions of the  law and to re-establish discipline, and fearing his vigour and justice, repented of what  they had done, and decided upon deserting his cause. They accordingly abandoned him,  and soon after hired some assassins,.who put him to death. In the mean while ’Alf Ibn  Hamid remained in Cordova, in full possession of the empire, which he held for two years  all but two months, until he was suffocated in the bath by some of his Sclavonian eunuchs.  This happened in the year 408 (beginning May 29, a.p. 1017). ’Ali left two sons, Yahya  and Idris.    Reign of Al-késim Ibn Hamid, surnamed Al-mdmin.    °Ali was succeeded by his brother, Al-késim Ibn Hamid, who was his elder by ten years.  On his accession to power, Al-kdésim took the surname of Al-mdmin: he was of mild  disposition, and the people enjoyed security under his rule. It has been said of him that he  was a Shiite; but this report is unfounded, since he never showed it in any of his acts;  nor did he or any of the other members of his family, who held empire in Andalus, ever  countenance by their practice any other sect but the orthodox one. In this way Al-késim  retained possession of the empire until the month of Rabi’ 1. of the year 412 (June or July, a.p.  1021), when his nephew, Yahya Ibn ’Alf Ibn Hamid, rose against him in Malaga. When  the news of this rising reached him, Al-késim abandoned his capital without a battle, and took  refuge in Seville. His nephew then left Malaga at the head of his army, and marched  upon Cordova, of which city he took possession without resistance. Having assumed the         U dub 7 Here follow in the original some extracts from poems written by Suleyman, which I have not translated.",593,,
"    xii APPENDIX.    title of Khalif, Yahya took upon the occasion the surname of Al-mv’tali, and remained in  possession of the empire, until Al-kd4sim, having re-established his influence, and regained  the affections of the Berbers, marched with them to Cordova, and entered that capital in  the year 413 (beginning April 5, a.p. 1022), his nephew, Yahya Ibn ’Ali, betaking himself to  Malaga.   Al-kdésim remained some months at Cordova, during which time his authority was weak-  ened and his empire subverted by his enemies. First, his nephew, Yahya, took Algesiras,  which was Al-kdsim’s strong-hold, and where he kept his women and his treasures. Then  another nephew of his, named Idris Ibn ’Ali, took possession of Ceuta, close to Tangiers, a  city which Al-kdsim always kept well garrisoned and provided with every warlike store, that  he might retire to it in case he should be obliged to quit Andalus. Lastly, a portion of  the inhabitants of Cordova having revolted against him, they shut the gates of the city, and  prepared for the defence. Al-kdsim, who was master of the suburbs, besieged them for  upwards of fifty days in the mosque of Abii Othman, where they had fortified themselves,  until, having made a sally, the Berbers took to flight, and abandoned the suburbs in  Sha’ban of the year 414 (Oct. or Nov. a.p. 1023), each tribe of the Berbers betaking them-  selves to those towns whereof their brethren were the masters. As for Al-kdsim, he retired  to Seville, where were his two sons, Mohammed and Al-hasan; but when the people of  that place heard of his defeat, and of his quitting Cordova and coming to them, they shut the  gates of their city, expelled his two sons as well as the Berbers who were with them,  and appointed three of the principal and most illustrious inhabitants of the place to command  over them, and administer the affairs of the community. These were the Kadi Abt-l-kdésim  Mohammed Ibn Isma’il Ibn ’Abbad Al-lakhmi, Mohammed Ibn Al-alehdni, and Mohammed  Ibn Mohammed Ibn Al-hasan Al-zubeydi, who held the government of Seville conjointly for  some days, sharing among themselves the duties of the administration until the Kadi Abi-l-  késim Ibn ’Abbdd made himself sole ruler, and caused his former partners in power to  resume the rank of subjects.   In the mean time Al-kdsim had taken refuge in Sherish (Xerez), a city which re-  mained faithful to him. When his nephew, Yahya, heard of his being there, he marched  in pursuit of him and arrived before Xerez, which he besieged. Al-kdsim defended himself  valiantly for some time; but at last the Berbers who composed the garrison, being tired of  the siege, held a council together, and decided upon deserting his cause and delivering him  into the hands of his nephew, which they did; Yahya becoming thereby the sole ruler of the  empire, and the only chief of the Berbers. Al-késim remained a prisoner in the hands of  Yahya, and, after the death of Yahya, in those of his brother Idris, until Idris himself died,  when Al-kdsim was soon after strangled in prison in the year 431 (beginning Sept. 22, a.p  1039). The body of Al-kdsim was given up to his son Mohammed, who ruled in Algesiras,  and who had him honourably buried there. His reign had lasted seven years, counting  from the day in which he took possession of the Khalifate in Cordova, to that in which  he fell a prisoner into the hands of his nephew Yahya. He remained in prison sixteen  years during the reigns of his two nephews, until he was put to death, as above related, at  the beginning of the year 431 (beginning Sept. 22, a. p. 1039), he being then eighty years",594,,

Al-kdsim left two sons, whom he had by one of his wives named Amfrah,® who was the  daughter of Al-hasan Ibn Kantin Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Mohammed Ibn Al-késim Ibn Idris Ibn  Idris Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Al-hasan Ibn ’Ali Ibn Abi Talib. One was named Mohammed, the  other Al-hasan. _    Reign of Yahya Ibn’ Ali, surnamed Al-mwtali.    Historians are at variance respecting the appellative of this Sultan; some calling him Abu  Is’hak, others Abi Mohammed. His mother’s name was Lebtinah, and she was the daughter  of Mohammed Ibn Al-hasan Ibn Al-kadsim, better known under the surname of Kantin,? who  was the son of Ibréhim Ibn Mohammed Ibn Al-kdsim, &c. This Al-hasan Ibn Kantin was  one of the greatest kings of the family of Hasan, and one of the bravest and most dreaded  by his subjects.   Yahya assumed the title of Khalif at Cordova in the year 413 (beginning April 15, a. p  1022), as above related. After this he fled to Malaga in the year 414 (beginning March 25,  A.D. 1023). He continued there, until in the year 416 (beginning March 3, a.p. 1025)  some ill-intentioned people attempted to re-establish his authority in Cordova, and succeeded  in their undertaking. But Yahya, who had already experienced how little he could rely  upon the fidelity of the Cordovans, would not then enter that capital, and appointed ’Abdu-r-  rahman Ibn 7Ittéf Al-yaférenf to govern in his name. Things remained in this state the  rest of the year 416 and all 417 (beginning Feb. 21, a.p. 1026). After this the people  of Cordova expelled Ibn ’Ittéf, and appointed a descendant of the house of Umeyyah to be  their ruler. Yahya, however, continued going to and fro with his army, and laying waste the  country, until the greater part of the Berbers agreed to acknowledge his authority, and gave  him possession of the fortresses, castles, and cities which they held in their hands. By these  means the power of Yahya increased, and he went to Carmona with the intention of making  war against Ibnu ’Abbéd, and laying siege to Seville, which city he was anxious to take.  Having one day gone out of Carmona to a lofty mountain in the neighbourhood, for the  purpose of reconnoitering, he fell into an ambush prepared by his enemy, and was put to  death. This happened on a Sunday, the seventh day of Moharram of the year 427 (Nov. 11, -  A.D. 1035). Yahya left two sons, Al-hasan and Idris, whom he had by one of his  wives.    Reign of ?Abdu-r-rahmdn Ibn Hishim Al-mustadh'her.    When, in the year 414, Al-késim and the Berbers were defeated by the inhabitants of  Cordova, and obliged to quit that capital, as above related, the people held counsel together,  and decided upon restoring the empire to the Beni Umeyyah. There were three descendants  of that family residing in that capital at the time, namely: ’Abdu-r-rahman, son of Hishém  Ibn ’Abdi-l-jabbér Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén An-ndsir, who was the brother of Mohammed  Al-muhdi, former Sultan of Cordova; Suleymén, son of the above-mentioned Al-murtadhi,         © Fl > yg—i5 which Ibnu Khalddn (fo. 99, verso) writes yy. 6 Kabiin,",595,,

The  empire devolved upon ’Abdu-r-rahm&n, who numbered the most votes; and he was, accord-  ingly, proclaimed Khalif on the thirteenth day of Ramadhén of the year 414 (28th November,  A.D. 1023), at the age of two-and-twenty, having been born in the month of Dhi-l-ka’dah  of the year 392 (September or October, a. p. 1002). His mother’s name was Ghéyah. He  used the appellative Abi-l-motref, and on his accession to power took the honorary surname  of Al-mustadh’her (he who implores the assistance of God). His reign, however, was not of  long duration; for he had been but a short time in power, when Abi ’Abdi-r-rahmén  Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Ibn ’Obeydillah Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén An-nésir revolted  against him, with a party composed of the dregs of the population, and he was put to  death three days before the end of Dhi-l-ka’dah of the same year 414 (10th February, a.p.  1024). ’Abdu-r-rahmén left no posterity. He was exceedingly fond of letters, very eloquent,  and could write verses in a very tender strain. It is so stated by our master Abi Mohammed  Ali Ibn Ahmed,’ who lived in his time, and- was well acquainted with him.""    Reign of Mohammed Ibn ’ Abdi-r-rahman, surnamed Al-mustakfi.    ?Abdu-r-rahmén was succeeded, as above related, by Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén, who  was forty-eight years of age at the time he took possession of the throne, having been born in  the year 366 (beginning Aug. 29, a.p. 976). His appellative was Abu ’Abdi-r-rahmén, and his  mother’s name Hauré. His father, ’Abdu-r-rahmén, had been put to death by Mohammed  Tbn Abi ’A’mir, at the beginning of the reign of Hishém Al-muyyed, under the pretence that he  was planning a revolt for the purpose of seizing on the empire. This Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-r-  rahmén took the surname of Al-mustakfi, and governed for sixteen months and some days,  until he was deposed in the year 415, the empire returning to the family of Yahya Ibn  *Ali Al-hasani. Al-mustakfi was compelled to leave his capital in disguise, and take refuge  in the Thagher. They say that when he reached a town called Shamunt,""* in the district of  Medinaceli, he sat down to take some food. There happened to be with him at the time  a man named ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Mohammed Ibn As-selim, of the posterity of Sa’id Ibn  Al-mundhir, the celebrated rebel who rose during the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahmaén An-nésir.  This man, being tired of wandering about in Al-mustakfi’s company, decided to get rid  of him. He took some poisonous herbs, which are very plentiful in that part of the country,  and dressed him a fowl with them. No sooner had Al-mustakfi partaken of it than he died;  when the man dug a hole, and buried him on the spot. His reign was one of continued  troubles and agitation. He left no posterity.         © This is Abi Mohammed ’Ali Ibn Ahmed /én Hazm, the author of the epistle on the literature of the Spanish Arabs,  translated in the first volume of this work, pp. 168-199.

"    APPENDIX. XV    Reign of Hishém Ibn Mohammed, surnamed Al-mwtadd.    We have elsewhere related, that when, in the year 417 (beginning Feb. 21, a.p. 1026), Yahya  Ibn ’Ali Al-hasani was deprived of his power by a rebellion in Cordova, the people of that  city agreed to restore the empire to the Beni Umeyyah. Their chief counsellor and support  on this occasion was the Wizir Abu-l-hazm Jehwar Ibn Mohammed Ibn Mohammed Ibn  Jehwar Ibn ’Obeydillah Ibn Mohammed Ibn Al-ghamr Ibn Yahya Ibn ’Abdi-l-ghéfir Ibn Abi  ’Abdah. As all those who might have claimed a right to the empire, as descendants of that  illustrious family, had either disappeared during the civil wars in Cordova, or were hid in the  provinces, Jehwar and his friends wrote to the governors of the frontiers, and to all those who  had usurped the royal authority in the provinces, acquainting them with their determination,  and exhorting them to look out for the relics of the Beni Umeyyah, and to point out one who  might fill the throne and restore it to its pristine glory and splendour. The people in  the provinces agreed to this plan; and, after some time spent in searching for the princes of  the house of Umeyyah, a great-grandson of ’Abdu-r-rahmén An-nésir, named Abi Bekr  Hishém Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén An-ndésir, was raised to  the supreme power. They say that Hishém, who was a brother of Al-murtadhi, he who  rose during the empire of ’Ali Ibn Hamid, as above related, was residing at Al-bount  (Alpuente), under the protection of Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Kasim,  a noble chieftain, who had taken possession of that fortress. Immediately after his election,  Hishém was proclaimed Khalif, and received the oath of allegiance of the people of Cordova  in the month of Rabi’ 1. of the year 418 (April or May, a.p. 1027). He took on this  occasion the surname of Al-mwtadd-billah (he who is prepared in God). He was born in  the year 364 (beginning Sept. 20, a.p. 974), and was Al-murtadhi’s elder by four years.  His mother’s name was ’A’tita.'* The new Sultén, however, did not then enter Cordova,  but remained in the Thaghers, where serious disturbances had arisen, the different chiefs  and governors there waging war with each other. At last, after going backwards and  forwards for three years all but two months, Hishém succeeded in adjusting their dif-  ferences and quelling their dissensions; and he was thereby enabled to repair to Cordova,  the capital of the empire, which he entered on the day of Mina,""* being the eighth day of  Dhi-i-hajjah of the year 420 (17th Dec., a.p. 1029). Soon after, however, part of the army  rose against Hishém and deposed him; when, after many events, which it would take us  too long to relate, the dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah was for ever suppressed in Cordova.  After the deposition of Hishém, Jehwar Ibn Mohammed, who had been the principal  instrument of his elevation, gained possession of the supreme power. Jehwar had filled  the charge of Wizir during the government of the Beni Abi ’A’mir. He had great expe-         3 nn Le I think this name is badly written in the MS., but I have not the means of correcting it.

During the civil war he had taken no part whatever in public affairs, keeping  aloof from all parties contending for power; but, when he saw the field open before him, and  the occasion at hand, he dexterously seized it, and usurped the command. It must, however,  be said of Jehwar, that though he administered the government and provided for the security  of his capital; though he assumed in every respect all the authority of a supreme ruler,  he took none of the insignia of the Khalifate, but ruled as none of his predeces-  sors had done, declaring that he held the command until one more deserving of it,  or having better titles to the empire, should make his appearance, when he would imme-  diately resign all authority and power into his hands. He thus ordered that the palaces  of the Beni Umeyyah should be kept in the same state as they had been under the regular  government, and that the door-keepers, the servants and guards, should be stationed about  the gates of them as in former times. He himself never inhabited them, but resided at  his own private house in the city. The money arising from the collection of taxes,  which formerly entered the royal coffers, he placed in the hands of public officers appointed  for that purpose, and who were likewise charged with their distribution, he himself inspecting  their accounts. He formed the tradespeople of Cordova into a sort of militia, and assigned  to them a certain allowance, which was religiously paid out of the first sums collected in the  treasury: he gave them arms, and formed them into various corps, which relieved each other  in the guard of the city, going their rounds night and day about the shops, markets, and  streets, so that, if any thing occurred, every man might be found at his post with his arms.  He was in the habit of attending funerals and visiting the sick, imitating in every respect the  conduct of the good Sultans his predecessors: he, nevertheless, administered the affairs of  the state as the other independent rulers of his day were in the habit of doing. So great was  the confidence which the people placed in his justice, that Cordova was in his time like  a sanctuary, and no man had any thing to fear from his enemies. This state of things  lasted until Jehwar died, in Safar of the year 435 (Sept. or Oct., a.p. 1043). He was  succeeded in command by his son, Abd-l-walid Mohammed Ibn Jehwar, who followed  his steps in the administration of the government until he died; when, after various changes  and revolutions which happened in Cordova, and which it is not to our purpose to relate, Al-  mamin, King of Toledo, took possession of it. Al-m4miin ruled for a short period of time,  and then died in that place. After this Cordova fell into the hands of the King of Seville,  the Amir Adh-dhéfir Ibn ’Abbéd, under whose sway, if I am rightly informed, it still  continues.’   In the mean while Hishém Al-mv’tadd, who had been in confinement, found means  to escape, and took refuge with Ibn Hid at Lerida, where he remained until the time of his  death, in the year 427 (beginning Nov. 4, a.p. 1035). Hishém having left no male children,  the family of Merwdn was entirely extinguished, and their empire abolished for ever. It  is true that, whilst Yahya Ibn ’Ali Al-hasanf was besieging Seville, the inhabitants of that  place, and such as followed their party in the neighbouring districts, and dreaded the rule of         6 Al-homaydi wrote towards the year 460, when Mohammed Ibn ‘Abbad was still in possession of Cordova.",598,,

But all this was a stratagem devised by Ibnu ’Abbdd, the  ruler of Seville, as we have shown elsewhere. At last, when it was close upon the year 450 (be-  ginning Feb. 27, a.p. 1058), the same people who had proclaimed Hisham gave out that he was  dead; and thus did the khotbah for the Beni Umeyyah cease from the pulpits of the mosques  in all the provinces of Andalus until the present moment, when it has not yet been re-  established.    Sultdns of the family of Idris.    But to return to the Sultans of the posterity of Al-hasan. After the death of Yahya  Ibn ’Ali, who, as before stated, was killed on the seventh day of Moharram of the year 427  (Nov. 11, a.p. 1035), Abi Ja’far Ahmed Ibn Abi Musa, better known under the surname of  Ibn Bokennah,""* and Naja, the Sclavonian eunuch, both of whom had once been ministers of  the Beni Hasan, returned to Malaga, then the seat of the empire of that family, and caused  the khotbah to be said in the name of Idris Ibn ’Alf, Yahya’s brother; for, although Yahya  had left two sons, named Hasan and Idris, those ministers were unwilling to trust them with  the command, owing to their being very young when their father died. This being done, they  dispatched messengers to Idris, who was then in Ceuta, of which city he was governor,  as well as of Tangiers and the surrounding districts, informing him of his elevation to power.  Idris immediately sailed for Malaga, where he was proclaimed Khalif, on condition that  he should give possession of Ceuta to his nephew Hasan, one of the sons of Yahya. Idris  having agreed to accept of the empire on the above condition, Najd proceeded to Africa  to put Hasan in possession of Ceuta and Tangiers. This Hasan was the youngest of Yahya’s  sons; he was, however, the strongest and the bravest.   On his accession to power, Idris took the surname of Al-mutdyyed. He remained in posses-  sion of the throne until the year 330 (beginning Sept. 25, a. p. 931) or 331 (Sept. 14, a. v.  932), when a civil war broke out through the ambition of the Kadi Abu-l-késim Mohammed  Ibn Isma’il Ibn *Abbad, Lord of Seville, who, wishing to possess himself of the territories  close to his dominions, sent his son Isma’il with his own troops, and such among the Berber  tribes as obeyed his rule, against Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Al-birzdlf, Lord of Carmona,  which city he besieged. Thence Isma’fl marched to Oshiinah (Osuna), and then to Ezija,  both of which he took. Mohammed having implored the assistance of Idris, and of Badis,  chief of the tribe of Senhajah, who ruled in Granada, the former sent him an army at the com-  mand of his minister Ibn Bokennah, and the latter hastened to his assistance in person, both  effecting their junction with Mohammed. It appears, however, that Mohammed’s auxiliaries  were seized with a panic at the sight of Isma’il, who, as before mentioned, commanded the  forces of his father Mohammed Ibn ’Abbéd; for they retreated before him, each returning to  his own dominions. When this intelligence was brought to Isma’fl his hopes increased, and   2 ue    ar  © This word is sometimes written AiR, ,,,.! Ibn Baknab, at other times Xi .,,! Ibn Bokennab.    VOL. II. c",599,,

He, accordingly,  started off in pursuit of him with the utmost speed he could use; but when Bédis saw that he  could not escape his pursuer, he sent a message to Ibn Bokennah, who had parted company  with him only one hour before; and having joined their forces, they determined to make a halt,  and wait for their enemy. Soon after, Isma’il appeared in sight, and the two hosts met; but  scarcely had a few blows been exchanged on each side, when the troops of Isma’il suddenly  gave way and left the field of battle in the utmost confusion. Isma’{l was in the number of  the slain, having been one of the first killed. He was immediately beheaded, and his head  carried to Malaga, to be presented to Idris Ibn ’Alf. This monarch was then on his death-  bed, and suffering under a disease of which he died. He had removed from Malaga to the  mountain of Bobdshter,!” where he had a castle. He lived only two days after the head of  Isma’il was brought to him. Idris left three sons: Yahya, who was afterwards put to  death; Mohammed, who took the surname of Al-muhdi; and Hasan, who assumed that of  As-siémi. He had another son named ’Ali, who was the eldest, but he died in his father’s  lifetime, leaving behind him a son named Mohammed, whom his uncle exiled on his ac-  cession to the throne.   During these transactions another prince of the family of Hamid established himself at  Algesiras. Yahya Ibn ’Ali, above mentioned, had, during his reign, confined his two cousins,  Mohammed and Al-hasan, the sons of Al-késim Ibn Hamid, in the castle of that city. The  person intrusted with their custody was an African known by the name of Abit-l-hejéj, who,  on the death of Yahya, took the two princes out of prison, and, having called together all  the Africans and blacks who were in Algesiras, said to them, “ These are your two rightful  sovereigns ;” upon which all the troops present hastened to take the oath of allegiance to  them, owing to the great affection which their father, Al-késim, had always shown towards  the blacks, and the numerous benefits he had conferred upon them. Mohammed was  then immediately proclaimed, and he ruled undisturbed over Algesiras and its districts,  though he never assumed the title of Khalif. His brother Hasan remained some time with  him, until, having been suddenly seized with a strong desire to take the woollen dress (to  become a Stiff), he retired from the world. He afterwards went out as a pilgrim to Mekka,  together with his sister Fatimah, the daughter of Al-kdésim, and wife of Yahya Ibn ’Alf  Al-mu’tali. But to return to the principal branch of the family.   After the death of Idris Ibn ’Ali, which happened in the manner above related, the minister  Ibn Bokennah raised to power his son Yahya, better known under the surname of Al-  habbin,'® and administered the kingdom for him. Ibn Bokennah, however, did not show upon  this occasion all the fortitude required for such an undertaking, but hesitated, and gave  evident signs of weakness. When the news of the defeat of Isma’il Ibn ’Abbéd and the  death of Idris Ibn ’Ali reached Ceuta, Najé the Sclavonian, who ruled over that city, under-  took to place upon the throne of Malaga Al-hasan, the son of Yahya. Having appointed  a man of his own nation to command in his absence, he crossed over to Malaga, taking that  prince with him. On their arrival in that port, the courage of Ibn Bokennah failed him, and         2G ed s    of petlo See Conde (vol. ii. p. 16), who read Yebaster. ® Ope",600,,
"    APPENDIX. xix    he fled to Hisn-Koméresh (Comares), eighteen miles from that city. Naj4 and Hasan then  entered Malaga, where they were immediately joined by the Berbers, the former being soon  after proclaimed Khalif by the people, who gave him on the occasion the surname of  Al-mustanser, After this, Hasan sent a messenger to Ibn Bokennah, granting him his pardon  if he would return to Malaga; but on his arrival there he had him seized and put to death, as  well as his oWn cousin, Yahya Ibn Idris. Najé then returned to Ceuta and Tangiers, leaving  with Hasan a man known under the patronymic of Ash-shettifi,'? who was a sailor, and in  whom he had the most implicit reliance. Things remained in this state for nearly two years,  until Hasan was poisoned by his own wife,” the daughter of his uncle, Idris Ibn ’Alf. They  say that she did it out of revenge for the death of her brother, Yahya Ibn Idris, whom  Hasan, as before related, caused to be put to death on his accession to power.   After the death of Hasan, Ash-shettiff assumed the command, and having confined to  a dungeon Idris Ibn Yahya, brother of the deceased, wrote to apprise Najé of what  had occurred. Hasan had left in the hands of Najé a son of tender age, and they say that on  hearing the news of the death of the father, that Sclavonian placed this son in confinement,  and soon after had him put to death; but God only knows!   As there remained no prince of the posterity of Hasan Ibn Yahya, Najé conceived the  project of usurping the royal power. Having appointed one of his own countrymen, in whom  he could trust, to command over Ceuta and Tangiers in his absence, he put to sea, and  landed at Malaga. On his arrival there he placed Idris Ibn Yahya in still closer confinement,  increased the number of his guards, and aimed at taking the power entirely out of the hands  of the Beni Hasan, and seating himself on their throne. To this end, he sent for the chiefs  of the Berbers, who were the troops of the country, and discovered his plans to them,  promising them ample reward in case of success. Naja found them deaf to his propositions,  and not one proferred him assistance: thinking, however, that the time was not yet come to  rid themselves of Najé, the Berbers feigned to acquiesce in his plans, and lent him their  assistance in public, though they were very differently disposed from the bottom of their  hearts. After this, Najé called together his army, and marched upon Algesiras, with the  intention of exterminating Mohammed Ibn Al-késim, who was ruling there. He besieged  that city for some days, until, having received intelligence that some of his followers were  meditating a revolt against him, he decided upon returning to his capital. As he was  journeying thither, some of the chiefs of the conspiracy, fearing that if Naja came to inquire  into the affair he would immediately dispatch them and pardon the rest, rode secretly  forward, and waited for him in ambush in a mountain-pass, whereby he had to pass on his  way to Malaga. Accordingly, when Najé, who rode in front of the host with a few horsemen,  came to the pass, he was suddenly attacked by the Berbers. The Sclavonians who composed  his guard being thrown into confusion by the suddenness of the attack, ran away, and  deserted him; and Naja fell under the blows of his assassins, two of whom immediately  galloped off to Malaga, which they entered, crying, at the top of their voices, “ Good news!    » aus! —that is, from Shettif, or he Settff, the ancient Sitipha.    P Yast oe aul dine Ul xis —which Conde (vol. ii. p. 19) translates by era Wamada Asagia (her name  was Asafia). Blunders of this sort abound in the work of that writer.",601,,
"    xx APPENDIX.    good news! Naja is killed.” They then went to the dwelling of Ash-shettifi, ran him  through with their swords, and put him to death; soon after, the rest of the army made their  appearance, and, having taken Idris Ibn Yahya out of his prison, they proclaimed him  Khalif, and swore allegiance to him. On his accession to power, Idris took the surname of  Al-éli. :   The character of Idris was a compound of excellent qualities with inclinations ill fitted to a  monarch. He was the most kind-hearted and charitable of men: he would distribute every  Friday among the poor five hundred dinars; he allowed all those who had been exiled under  the preceding reigns to return to their homes, and restored to them their lands, farms, and  whatever property belonging to them had been confiscated by his predecessors in power.  As long as his reign lasted, not a complaint was heard among his subjects; he was, besides,  well informed, fond of science, and would frequently repeat fine poetical fragments; but,  with all this, he was very fond of associating with low and vulgar people; he would re-  ceive them at all hours in his palace, and his own wives would even appear unveiled in the  presence of his guests: his prodigality was so excessive, that if a man of the tribe of Senhajah,  or of the Beni Yeféren, inhabiting the neighbouring kingdom of Granada, asked him for one  of his castles, he would immediately give him possession of it. Upon one occasion the Amir  of Senhajah wrote to him, asking him to deliver into his hands the person of his own Wizir  and minister, Musa Ibn ’Affin, against whom he had conceived great enmity: Idris, being  greatly attached to Musa, who had been the friend and companion of his father and grand-  father, both of whom he had served with fidelity and zeal, would not at first comply with his  request; but when Misa heard that the Amir of Senhdjah peremptorily asked for his delivery,  and that Idris would at last be compelled to execute his commands, he generously went up to  his master, and said to him, “ Do as thou art commanded, O Amir! and may the will of God  be done.” Misa was accordingly sent to him of Senhajah, who, immediately upon his  arrival, put him to death.   This, and other evident proofs of unpardonable weakness, alienated from Idris the affections  of his subjects, and they decided to deprive him of the empire. Idris had before this con-  fined in the castle of Ayrosh” two youths, named Mohammed and Hasan, who were the  sons of his uncle, Idris Ibn ’Alf. The conspirators accordingly cast their eyes on Mo-  hammed, the eldest, and, having caused the garrison of that fort to rise in his favour,  proclaimed him their sovereign. When the news of this insurrection reached the black  troops, who composed the garrison of the Kassébah of Malaga, they also joined in the  movement, and, having proclaimed Mohammed, wrote to him to come to them. In the  mean while they fortified themselves in the Kassabah: the people of Malaga, however, being  partial to Idris, collected round him, and advised him immediately to attack the Kassdbah,  and punish the rebels. Had he done so, the blacks could not have held out for an hour:  but Idris refused to follow their advice, and said to them, “ Let every one of you go home,  and leave me alone.” The citizens having done as they were required, it was not long  before his cousin made his appearance in Malaga, when he was proclaimed Khalif without  opposition, and received the allegiance of the troops and the inhabitants.         a or!",602,,
"    APPENDIX. xxi    On his assuming the command, Mohammed Ibn Idris took the surname of Al-muhdi, and  appointed his brother Hasan Wali-l-ahd, or successor to the empire, giving him the surname  of As-sdémi. One of the first acts of Mohammed’s government was to confine the late.  monarch in the very dungeon wherein he himself had been shut up. He also displayed  much firmness and vigour in the administration; owing to which, the Berbers, who dreaded  his justice, decided to deprive him of his power. Having sent their emissaries to the  fortress where Idris Ibn Yahya was confined, the governor entered into their plans, and rose  with the garrison, again proclaiming Idris Ibn Yahya.   On his first accession to power, after the murder of Najé, this monarch had appointed  two of his father’s slaves, named Rizkullah and Sokkat,* who belonged to the sect of  the Baragh’wattah, to be governors of Ceuta and Tangiers. When Idris was deposed by  Mohammed, these two governors remained faithful to their master, administering his African  dominions in his name. Idris, however, was proclaimed for the second time at the castle of  Ayrosh, as above related; but Mohammed showed no fear whatever; on the contrary, he  displayed much energy and courage. His mother, too, who was a very spirited woman,  assisted him most efficaciously. By taking the field in person, and distributing rewards among  those who most distinguished themselves by their courage, she kept the rebels in check and  disconcerted their plans, until the Berbers, seeing no hope of success, abandoned the cause of  Idris, and decided upon sending him over to Africa, and intrusting him to the care of the two  Baragh’wattah governors above mentioned. When Idris, who had previously placed his own  son under their custody, arrived in Africa, the governors received him with every show of  attention and respect, and had him proclaimed Khalif in their mosques, although in reality  all power was vested in their hands. Things remained in this state until some of the principal  Berbers came over to Idris, and said to him, “ These two slaves are masters of thy person,  “ and are interposed between thee and the empire; grant us permission to deliver thee from  “them.” Idris, however, would not listen to their proposition, but acquainted the two  governors with the plans of their enemies, upon which the Baragh’wattah began by exiling  the counsellors ;7 and some time after, mistrusting Idris himself, they also expelled him, and  sent him over to Andalus in a vessel, although they still acknowledged him as Khalif,  and continued to have the khotbah said in his name. The Baragh’wattah retained the son  of Idris on account of his extreme youth.   After this, Mohammed Ibn Idris, having disagreed with his brother As-sémi, banished him to  Africa, where he arrived, and took up his abode, establishing soon after his sovereignty in the  mountains of Gomarah (Gomera), the country whence the Beni Hasan had first issued, and the  inhabitants of which still entertained the greatest veneration and respect for that family. In  the mean while the Berbers of Malaga, who could not tolerate the rule of Mohammed, decided         es  2 «5%. This appears to be the same individual called hw Sakdt by Ibnu Khaldin. See vol. i. p. 333. On  the origin of the religious sect of the Baragh’wattah, see ibid.    33 Conde, who calls these governors Razikaba and Sekan, did not understand the meaning of this passage, which he found  word for word in Adh-dhobi (Nat. Lib. Mad., Gg. 14, fo. 17). He makes the two Baragh’wéttah fall by the hands of the  populace, and says that Idris sailed afterwards for Malaga, taking his son with him.",603,,
"    xxii APPENDIX.    upon starting another competitor for the crown. Having entered into a secret correspondence  with Mohammed Ibn Al-kd4sim, King of Algesiras, they promised him their help, and assured  him of the victory if he would dispute the empire. Mohammed’s ambition being kindled, he  marched out of Algesiras at the head of his army and joined the Berbers, who immediately  invested him with the Khalifate, giving him the surname of Al-muhdi. The world  then presented the ridiculous and highly objectionable picture of no less than four princes  assuming at once the title of Amfru-l-mimenin, in a country the extent of which does not  exceed thirty square farsangs. However, the Berbers stayed some days with Mohammed,  after which they all left him and returned to their country; he also returning, ashamed  and crest-fallen, to Algesiras, where he soon after died, they say, of sorrow and disappoint-  ment, leaving eight male children. Mohammed was succeeded in the kingdom of Algesiras  by his son Al-késim Ibn Mohammed Ibn Al-kdsim, who, however, did not assume the title  of Khalif. As to Mohammed Ibn Idris, of Malaga, he remained in possession of the  kingdom until the time of his death, which happened in 445 (beginning April 22, a.p. 1053).  On the death of Mohammed, the Berbers sent for Idris Ibn Yahya (Al~’éli), who was then  living among the Beni Yeféren, and offered him the throne, which he accepted.   These are the Sultans of the family of Idris who held rule over Malaga and the neighbour-  ing districts. We do not mention many others who reigned about the same time in other  provinces in Andalus, because none of them assumed the title of Khalif.    .              APPENDIX C.    Extracts from the historical work entitled Kitdbu-l-iktifa ft akhbdri-l-kholafa (the book of  sufficiency on the history of the Khalifs),' containing a concise account of the history of  Mohammedan Spain, from the death of Al-hakem Al-mustanser-billah, the ninth Sultén of  Cordova, till the arrival of the Almohades.    After the death of Al-hakem, his son Hisham, still of tender age, succeeded him. Soon  after his accession, Ibn Ab{ ’A’mir, who had been Al-hakem’s secretary, was appointed to the  charge of Wizir, and his influence over the youthful monarch gradually increased. Being a  shrewd and active man, he made himself completely master of the person of Hishém, and  succeeded, by his liberality, his courage, and his secret intrigues, in securing to himself the  attachment of the army. He, moreover, contrived to keep Hisham in a state of insensibility,  by surrounding him with all manner of pleasures and dissipation; and having chosen the  Katibs or secretaries, as well as the governors of the provinces, from among his own relatives,  or from those among his personal friends on whom he could most rely, he then took into         1 See vol. i. App. D. p. xlii. et seq.",604,,
"    APPENDIX. xxiii    his hands the whole of the authority, leaving to his sovereign Hishém only the title of Khalif,  the khotbah (or proclamation in the mosque), and the coinage of money in his name; for every  decree emanated from him, while he made the people believe that it was his sovereign’s  will, Al-manstir’s next step was to build for himself a very strong castle, whither he removed  all the treasures of the state. When his ambition had in a certain manner been satisfied, he  began to give evident proofs of those military talents which he so highly displayed during his  administration, and to direct against the infidels those numberless expeditions by which he  acquired so great a celebrity. Indeed, God Almighty always gave victory to his arms, and  wherever he met the Christians he destroyed and annihilated them. In this manner he  marched against Barcelona, which city he besieged and took, after killing its king, Borel.?  He then razed the fortifications and returned to Cordova, loaded with rich spoil, consisting of  arms, dresses, money, horses, and beasts of burden; and bringing besides with him an  immense number of male and female captives.   Various other incursions were subsequently made by Al-manstr in the same districts, every  where overturning and destroying the Christian armies that opposed him, and reducing to  his obedience the farthest limits of the country of the infidels. The fame of his exploits  became so great, that the Emperor of Constantinople sent him ambassadors, and sought his  alliance and friendship, as did also the Lord of Rome,’ and the King of Castile, all of whom  sent him costly presents and all kinds of rarities, the produce of their respective countries,  with a view to conciliate his favour, and to obtain security and peace.   Thus did Al-manstr continue for twenty-eight years administering the affairs of the  Moslems, and keeping his sovereign Hishém in the same state of seclusion and non-entity  to whith we have alluded. At last, death, against whose blows nobody stands secure, struck  him on his return from an expedition to the country of the infidels. They relate, that a few  moments before he died, Al-mansir began to weep bitterly, which being observed by one of  his favourite eunuchs named Kauthar, who was his Hajib, and was then standing by his bed-  side, he addressed him thus:—“ Why dost thou weep, O master?”—‘“ I weep,” answered  Al-mansir, “ over my sins, and the evils I have entailed upon the Moslems of this country.”  “ How can that be,” replied Kauthar in amazement, “ when it is evident that Islam never  “was more flourishing, or the Mohammedan sway more widely extended, than under  “ thy administration? Hast thou not conquered the kingdoms of the infidels, and put down  “ their pride? hast thou not made the Christians of distant regions come like so many beasts  “ of burden to this capital, loaded with the earth of their native country, and lay it down at the  “ gate of thy palace, to serve afterwards for the construction of the great mosque ?”—“ Thou  “ sayest right,” replied Al-mansiir; “ but when I conquered the enemy’s country, when  “T seized on his castles and fortresses, I always took care to provide my new conquests  “ with the means of subsistence and defence, and to establish the means of a speedy commu-  “nication between them and our own settlements on the frontiers, that they might be  “instantly relieved in case of attack. I have thus made numerous settlements within  “the enemy’s country, and filled their towns and castles with Moslems. There lies my         2 The MS. reads by which is a mistake for wy 3 hey) wWeole",605,,
"    xxiv APPENDIX.    “error. Now that I am on the verge of death, who will imitate my example when I  “am gone? My sons, it is well known, spend their time in wanton dissipation, and  “they are utterly unfit for the task of checking the progress of a daring enemy, who,  “though now vanquished and humiliated, will soon recommence his attacks, will snatch  “one by one from the Moslems all the conquests I have made; and, when he finds that  “the provinces he traverses are well populated and provided with the necessaries of life,  “ will, without difficulty, push on his incursions to the very walls of this capital; nay, will  “ in time wrest from us all our dominions in this island. There lies my error! And yet God  “ Almighty inspired me more than once with the means of salvation; but I constantly  “ disregarded the admonition. Had I laid waste all the territories subdued by my arms,  “had I by ruin and destruction made a desert of at least ten days’ march between our  “ extreme frontier and that of the Christians, we might then have averted the approaching  “tempest, as it would have been extremely difficult for our enemies to march through a  “ desolated and unproductive country. But, alas! as things now stand, there is no salvation  “but in God.”—* Do not be afflicted,” said Kauthar; “ if God Almighty be pleased, thou  “shalt recover, and then thou mayst issue thy orders to that effect.”—“ No,” said Al-  manstr; “the opportunity is now gone. Were I to recover this my illness, and to  “command what I deem convenient for the safety of this nation, the Moslems would  “ say, ‘Al-manstr was attacked by a severe illness through which he lost his wits, and  “in a fit of insanity he ordered the devastation of the Moslem territory.’ ”   After the death of Ibn Abf ’A’mir, his son ’Abdu-l-mélik succeeded him in the charge  of Hajib, as well as in the command of the army, and in the favour of his monarch Hishiém,  who led the same secluded life as before, taking no part whatever in the affairs of the state.  ?Abdu-l-mélik followed the traces of his invincible father; he made war on the idolaters,  and was always successful, owing to which he was surnamed Al-mudhfer (the victorious).  After an administration of eight years he died almost suddenly of a quinsy in his throat.   ’Abdu-l-mélik was succeeded, in the year 400 (beginning August 24, a.p. 1009), by his  brother ’Abdu-r-rahman, who assumed the surname of Al-muAdi, but whom the people of  Cordova were in the habit of calling Shanjul,‘ or “the madman,” owing to his profligate life,  his impious habits, his familiarity with common soldiers and persons from the lowest ranks of  society, his drinking of wine and spirituous liquors,—of which he made a constant and immo-  derate use,—and, above all, his impudence and presumption, which prompted him to exact  from the inhabitants of Cordova an oath of allegiance to himself as their lawful sovereign.  After the death of Hishém, whose heir and successor he pretended to be, he assumed the  title of Wali ahdi-l-islim (presumptive heir to the throne). This rash conduct having  brought on ’Abdu-r-rahman the wrath of the Beni Umeyyah, who were already disgusted with  his tyranny and his excesses, a conspiracy was formed in Cordova, at the head of which was  a prince of that family,’ who rose in arms against him, as well as against Hishim. The rebel    ve  4 This word, which is sometimes written Uy Sanjtil, and sometimes Js Shanjil, is not Arabic, and   belongs, no doubt, to one of the African dialects which were about that time spoken at Cordova.

"    APPENDIX. XXV    being joined by the greater part of the army, and by almost all the inhabitants of Cordova,  secured the person of Hishém, of whom no more was heard afterwards, and succeeded also in  laying hold of Shanjil, whom he put to death and caused afterwards to be crucified.   When the governors in the provinces heard of the death of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn they all raised  the standard of revolt, each rising within the territories intrusted to his care, and with the  armies under his command. Thus Zeyri Ibn Mendd, with his followers, rose in Granada  and the adjoining districts; the Kédi Mohammed Ibn ’Abbdd did the same in Seville; and  Isma’fl Ibn Dhi-n-ntin in Toledo, where he commanded by delegation and by appointment  of Ibn Ab{ ’A’mir. Their example was soon followed by Yusuf Ibn Htid, who was governor  of Saragossa; in short, every Governor, Kadi, or man of consequence or authority who had  any troops under his command, hesitated not to declare himself in open rebellion against  the new Khalif of Cordova: for instance, Ibn Al-afttas proclaimed himself independent  at Badajoz; Ibn Samédeh, at Almeria; Mujahid, the Sclavonian, at Denia; Ibn Téhir, at  Murcia; besides a great many more from among the relatives or adherents of Mohammed  Ibn Abi ’A’mir, and his sons.   However, soon after the death of Shanjil and the disappearance of Hisham, another  member of the family of Umeyyah rose to revenge the blood of the son of Ibn Abi ’A’mir,  and started as competitor for the crown. His name was Al-musta’in:® he waged war for  some time with the usurper, but was at last defeated and put to death. Some historians have  asserted, that during this war the Khalif Hishém was one day found concealed in the palace  of Cordova; and that about that time also Ibn ’Abbdd, who rose in Seville, went about with  a man greatly resembling Hishém in personal appearance, and, having made the people  believe that he was their legitimate sovereign, caused them to acknowledge him as such and  obey his orders. But the fact is, that Ibn ’Abbéd really reigned in the name of this  pretended sovereign, who was a mere tool of his ambition, as was afterwards discovered ;  for, when he thought that his authority had been firmly established, and his power was  sufficiently dreaded, he gave out that Hishim was dead, and that he had, before his death,  appointed him his successor. In this manner was the Khalifate extinct in Andalus: the  wheels of fate revolved their rotations of woe and perdition; corruption and vice seized  the hearts of the rich and the poor, of the noble and the plebeian, of the lord and the vassal.  The obscure and the low rose in every corner of the empire; the fire of discord raged  through the Mohammedan provinces; and the Christians, seizing the opportunity, on all  sides attacked the Moslems, who, weakened and divided as they were, made a very slight  defence, the cruel enemies of our faith obtaining every where considerable advantages,  especially in Aragon and Castile.   In this manner they made an incursion into the kingdom of Toledo, and completely  defeated Isma’fl Ibn Dhi-n-ntin, who went out to meet them, making great slaughter among  his followers. They likewise attacked Saragossa, but they were there bravely met by  Suleyman Ibn Hid, who not only defeated the enemy, but plundered his camp, and killed  most of his men. About this time a powerful army of Christians came out from the country         * This was Suleyman Ibn Al-hakem.  VOL. Il. d",607,,

Another army came likewise from the great land (continent),  and having all joined together, they began to scour the country in all directions, killing the  inhabitants or making them captives, and committing all manner of excesses and depredations.  In this manner they appeared before the walls of Valencia, where they were met by Abu  Merwan ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Razin, who offered them battle. He was, however, defeated and  killed, and his army destroyed and dispersed. Thence the Christians went to Guadalajara,  where they were opposed by the governor of the town, the Kayid Ibn Katani; but he also  was defeated and severely wounded in the encounter. In short, God Almighty permitted  the King of Castile, A/-beytin, every where to chastise the rebellious chieftains who had pro-  claimed themselves independent; for he took by storm many of their towns, and, in spite  of all their efforts, subdued large tracts of the countries over which they ruled as masters.  These events happened in the year 425 (beginning Nov. 25, a. D. 1033).   After this, Al-Leytin returned to his dominions, having appointed his general, Ramiro,®  governor of his new conquests: this Ramiro established his residence in Barbastro, a city  which he had previously taken from Ibn Hiid, the King of Saragossa.   On his return to his states, Al-beytin found that a Christian king of the name of Ferdeland,?  whom he had left in Castile to command in his absence, had revolted against him, with a  view to dispossess him of that kingdom. They accordingly made war on each other for  several months. In the mean time Ibn Hiid, who burned to revenge the past disasters,  thinking the time was come to make an attack upon Ramiro, wrote to Ibn ’Abbéd, imploring  his assistance; and on the receipt of his letter the King of Seville immediately sent him  some forces under the command of an experienced general named Mu’adh Ibn Abi Korrah.  With these reinforcements Ibn Hid took the field and attacked Ramiro, whom he defeated ;  and having expelled the Christians from the countries which they occupied, he retook  Barbastro and various other strong towns. The news of these successes inspired confidence  in the Moslems, and their courage again revived, so that whenever the Christians dared to  attack their territory, they were invariably repulsed and beaten with great loss. However,  notwithstanding all these victories, hatred and ill-will still divided the Moslems, who, re-  gardless of their common danger, went on prosecuting their private feuds, and waging war one  against another, thus gaining little or no advantage against the common enemy, whose  forces happened at that time to be also weakened by intestine war.         7 The text reads thus: ee) ELGSS rs Lo J v0, ) pie p> poz! ob wv oa 9  weal pitie uf as ‘ 3 pitte jo—literally, G and there came out of the land of the Rim a large army, which    arrived to [the dominions of] the Lord of Kastiliah, the court of their kings, and, at that time, of their king 4/-deytin.”    The word etal AL-beytin, which lower down is written ered Al-betin, is, no doubt, intended for pou or ye  Pedro.

"    APPENDIX. XXVvii    Some time after these events the Christians made an incursion into the districts close to  Granada. They were, however, met by the Berbers, who not only routed them completely,  but took possession of all their baggage and stores. Then Ramiro, the son of Sancho,  marched towards Huesca, and overran its territory; but Ibn Hud, sallying out from Sara-  gossa, overtook him on the road, and a battle ensued, in which Ramiro himself was killed,  and his army entirely dispersed. The Franks also made an inroad into the neighbourhood  of Toledo, but the eunuch Wadheh,’? who commanded the armies of King Ibn Dhi-n-niin,  went out in pursuit of them, and put them to flight.   After this the Christians had wars among themselves; yet, though their attention  was thus diverted by their own internal troubles, they nevertheless continued to profit  by the dissensions of the Moslems, and the weakness to which they had been reduced.  During this interval they took from us several castles and important fortresses, such as Hisn  Kolimriah, Hisn Wakhshah, and Hisn Shirdr,"" this last place falling into the hands of  Sancho, son of Abarca. This Sancho"" died shortly afterwards, and was succeeded by his  three sons, Ferdeland (Fernando), Garcia, and Ramiro. (May the curse of God fall on them  all!). Fernando, being the eldest of the three, was chosen to succeed his father. Having  taken the field, he reduced several places, like Santa Maria, otherwise called the town of  Ibn Razin, and other strong fortresses. He also took from the Beni Al-afttas, who ruled  as masters over the western part of Andalus, several fortresses in the neighbourhood of  Badajoz.   This Fernando (may he be cursed!) died, leaving three sons, Sancho, Garcia, and Alfonso,  who disputed the crown amongst themselves. However, Sancho being put to death, and  Garcia being thrown into a dungeon, the empire devolved on their brother Alfonso, son  of Fernando, who, seeing himself without competitors, cast a wistful eye on the dominions  of the Moslems, and conceived in his base head the project of subjecting to his abominable  rule the whole of Andalus. In pursuance of his plans, the Christian king never ceased from  that moment to make incursions into the country of the Moslems, whom he generally found  in a state of dissension and internal discord, and fast working their own ruin and destruction.  Indeed, not only were the different independent chieftains at that time waging unrelenting  war against each other, but they would not unfrequently avail themselves of the arms of the  Christians to attack and destroy their own countrymen and brothers in religion, lavishing on  Alfonso costly presents, and giving him as many treasures as he chose to have, in order  to conciliate his good wishes, and to obtain security for themselves and assistance against  their enemies. The Christians, perceiving the state of corruption into which the Moslems  had fallen, rejoiced extremely ; for, at that time, very few men of virtue and principle were to              10 This Wadheh eos appears to be the same Sclavonian eunuch who directed for some time the administration of  Hisham IT.   uy ed Kolimriah is intended for Conimbra (now Coimbra) in Portugal.   12 Sancho II., King of Navarre.

The rulers of Andalus thought of nothing else than purchasing singing-  women and slaves, listening to their music, and passing their time in revelry and mirth,  spending in dissipation and frivolous pastimes the treasures of the state, and oppressing  their subjects with all manner of taxes and exactions, that they might send costly presents to  Alfonso, and induce him to serve their ambitious projects. Things went on in this way  among the rebellious chieftains of Andalus until weakness seized on the conquerors as well as  on the conquered, and baseness and vice preyed likewise on the assailants and the assailed:  generals and captains no longer displayed their wonted valour; warriors became cowardly and  base; the people of the country were in the greatest misery and poverty, the entire society  was corrupted, and the body of Islam, deprived alike of life and soul, became a mere corpse.  Those among the Moslem rulers who did not actually submit to Alfonso, consented to  pay him an annual tribute, thus becoming collectors in their own dominions of the revenues  of the Christian monarch! While this state of things lasted, not one dared to oppose his will  or disobey his commands. In the mean time the affairs of the Moslems were administered by  Jews, who fed on them as the lion on a defenceless animal, and who filled even the offices of  Wizir, Hajib, and Katib, reserved in former days for the most illustrious individuals in  the state: the Christians went every year round Andalus, plundering and making captives,  burning villages, and wasting the whole country.   In the midst of these troubles, namely, in the year 467 (beginning Aug. 26, a.p. 1074), died  the King of Toledo, Isma’il Ibn Dhi-n-niin, the same who took Cordova from Ibn ’Abbad,  and defended it afterwards from his attacks. Ibn Dhi-n-ntn surpassed many of the Moslem  kings of his time in courage and military talents. When he died, his body was carried on the  shoulders of his own men to Toledo, and there buried. He left no sons. That period of  history in which the disastrous events above related took place has been called by the  Arabian authors Ayydmu-l-firk (the days of division or confusion).   In the same year (A.H. 467) died at Shatibah (Xativa), his birth-place, the learned  theologian and traditionist the Imém Abi ’Amru Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr’® (may God show him  mercy !).   Isma’il Ibn Dhi-n-niin having left no male children, he was succeeded in the kingdom of  Toledo by his grandson, Yahya, who assumed the title of Al-kddir-billah. Yahya was imbe-  cile in mind and weak in body. He had been brought up in his father’s harem among  women and eunuchs, dancers and singers; and he was as unfit for the command of the army  as for the duties of the administration in those perilous times. He therefore abandoned him-  self completely into the hands of his slaves, and intrusted with his eunuchs the cares of the  government. This made him the scorn of his subjects; hated and despised by whom, he  became at the same time a mark to the ambition of his equals among the rulers of Andalus.   The King of Seville, Ibn ’Abbéd, was the first to assail him in his own dominions. Being  anxious to revenge upon him all the injuries he had received at his grandfather’s hands,  that monarch took the field at the head of considerable forces, and, after recovering Cordova         13 See vol. i. p. 457, where the death of this individual is said to have happened four years sooner, in 463.    ",610,,
"    APPENDIX. xxix    and the surrounding districts, reduced also Talavera, Ghafek, and all the territory laying  between those two cities.   Nor was Ibn ’Abbéd the only one who attacked this imbecile prince; the King of  Saragossa, Ibn Htid, made also an incursion into his territory, and, assisted by the tyrant Ibn  Radmir,""* took from him the cities of Santa Maria and Molina.'® Unable to withstand alone  the attacks of his two formidable adversaries,—a task, besides, for which his cowardice and  stupidity made him totally unfit,—Yahya solicited the aid of the tyrant Alfonso. In the  mean time the city of Valencia, which formed part of Yahya’s dominions, as inherited from his  grandfather, Al-mdmin, threw off its allegiance; Ibn Hid having prevailed upon the  governor, Abi Bekr Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz, to declare himself in open revolt, and to assume  the command of the place. The King of Saragossa then asked in marriage the daughter  of Abi Bekr, expecting that the match would be the means of his getting possession of  the kingdom of Valencia, which he ardently wished for.   At the same time the city of Cuenca,'® which belonged also to Al-kédir, was besieged by Ibn  Radmir. That tyrant pressed the town until the inhabitants were on the point of starvation  through hunger and thirst; when, unable to hold out any longer, they capitulated, and  agreed to pay him a considerable sum of money if he would raise the siege; which he did.  Al-kadir then sent an army, under the command of Bashir the eunuch, to meet the  combined forces of Ibn Htid and Ibn Radmir; but that general returned without en-  countering the enemy, who had already retired into their respective countries loaded with  rich spoil.   About this time there was a popular commotion in Toledo, wherein the theologian  Abi Bekr Ibn Al-hariri, and several other distinguished men, fell victims to an in-  furiated mob, the houses of the rich people being also gutted, and all manner of excesses  committed.   When King Al-kédir saw himself thus surrounded by his enemies, he wrote to apprise  Alfonso of his critical situation, and begged the Christian king to send an army to his assist-  ance. The tyrant’s answer was thus conceived :— If thou wishest me to defend and protect  “thee against thy enemies, send me so much money; if not, I will deliver thee into their  “hands.” This King Alfonso was a very shrewd and perfidious man, and he saw with secret  delight the disturbances raised in the very heart of the Moslem dominions by their ambitious  rulers. He well knew that in proportion as they consumed their own resources and those of  their subjects in useless and petty warfare, his own power would increase, and that the moment  was fast approaching for his conquering the whole of Andalus. He therefore took the  first opportunity, which offered itself by the non-compliance of Al-kédir with the terms of the  treaty, to invade the dominions of that monarch, as we shall presently relate. However, when  Yahya received the above answer, he called together to a council the functionaries of the  state, and the governors of his provinces, besides a considerable number of his subjects, and.  communicated to them Alfonso’s proposal. “The Christian king,” said Yahya to the  assembly, “ has pledged himself by a most solemn oath, that unless you bring me imme-         ™ Sancho I. of Aragon, and IV. of Navarre.

So disgusted were the people of Toledo with Yahya’s  willingness to comply with the exorbitant demands made by the Christian king, that they pro-  nounced him to be utterly unfit to govern them, and decided to enter into a secret correspond-  ence with Ibn Al-afttas, king of Badajoz, and persuade him to deprive Al-kédir of the empire.   No sooner was Al-kadir informed of the plot entered into against him, than, not deeming  himself secure in Toledo, he fled at night with his treasures and a few only of his adherents,  and took the road to Webdeh (Huete) ;!7 but the governor, named Ibn Wahb, shut the  gates and refused him admission. During this interval Ibn Al-afttas arrived in sight of Toledo,  and entered that city.   In this emergency Al-kédir again sought the aid of Alfonso. Surrounded on every side by  enemies, his sole hope of salvation was in the Christian king. He wrote to him and  implored his assistance, and the tyrant accordingly hastened to help him. Al-kadir went  out to meet the Christian, when it was mutually agreed that Alfonso should lay siege to  Toledo, until he should expel Ibn Al-afttas and restore the city to Al-kédir, who, on the  restoration of his capital, was to hand over to Alfonso the whole of his treasures. As a  security against any infraction of this treaty, Alfonso was to retain as pledges the fortresses  of Soria and Conéria.’* These conditions being mutually agreed upon, the Christians were  put in possession of the above fortresses, which they put in an excellent state of defence by  considerably augmenting their fortifications, and garrisoning them with their best troops.  Alfonso then laid siege to Toledo.   Ibn Al-afttas seeing himself closely besieged by the Christians, and not expecting assistance  from any one, abandoned the city, and Al-kadir was again put in possession of it. Agreeably  to his promise, Al-kddir collected all the money he could among the inhabitants of the place,  and presented it to Alfonso; but this the tyrant would not receive. Al-kddir then brought  him the whole of the treasures and jewels which he had inherited from his father and grand-  father; but still the amount not being equal to the promised sum, Al-kédir begged Alfonso  to wait for the payment of the remainder; his request being granted by the Christian king on  condition that the fortress of Canales '° should be given over to him as security. When Alfonso  saw himself master of that important fortress, he immediately garrisoned it with his best  troops, and filled it with provisions and military stores. After which he returned to Castile,  rich, safe, and with his saddle-bags full of plunder.   Alfonso’s interference on this occasion, far from being beneficial to Al-kadir, proved the              cue    WT read Bay 9 Webdeh (Huete), a small town north-east of Toledo, between Cuenca and Guadalaxara.

It alienated the hearts of his subjects  entirely from him; many of whom left Toledo secretly, and repaired to the dominions  of Ibn Hid, by whom they were kindly received and honourably entertained, this monarch  bestowing on them all manner of favours and distinctions. The kingdom of Toledo, too,  became a target for the ambition of neighbouring princes, all of whom strove to gain  possession of it. Thus Ibn ’Abbdd attacked it from the west, whilst Ibn Hid made it feel  on the east all the agonies of death.   When Al-kédir perceived that he was unable to resist the simultaneous attacks of his  enemies, and that no way was left open to him to escape from their clutches, he again  wrote to Alfonso, offering to cede to him Toledo and its environs, provided he would  assist him in the conquest of Valencia and its dependencies. No sooner did Alfonso receive  the letter containing this proposition, than he flew towards Al-kddir as if he had had wings,  and, marching night and day, arrived in sight of Toledo, which city was immediately put  at his disposal, and the inhabitants at his discretion. Before surrendering his capital to  Alfonso, Al-kddir stipulated for the following conditions. Every Moslem was to enjoy  security for himself, family, and children; he was, moreover, to retain possession of his  property. Those who chose might quit the town with all their goods and chattels; those  who preferred to remain were only to be subject to the payment of the customary tribute,”  in proportion to the number of individuals who composed their family. It was further  stipulated that if any one of the inhabitants chose to return after an absence of some time,  he should be allowed again to settle in Toledo with whatever goods or property he had,  without being subjected to the payment of duties or other personal inconvenience owing  to the amount of the same.   Alfonso gave his assent to this capitulation, which he confirmed by a touch of his right  hand, swearing faithfully to observe every one of the conditions therein contained. The  taking of Toledo by Alfonso happened in 478 (a.p. 1085). Tarik Ibn Zeydd having taken  it in the year 92, it had thus remained the abode of Islim for a period of 386 years. On  the entrance of the Christians most of the inhabitants left the city, and retired to other  provinces occupied by their brethren in religion. Toledo, in the mean time, remained in  the hands of the infidels, who were left in undisturbed possession of it, as no attempt  was made or wish manifested to snatch it from them, until the news came that the  Almoravides, after defeating the tribe of Zenétah, had conquered the whole of Western  Africa. These tidings filled with joy the Moslems of Andalus, whose hope was strengthened  and whose spirit was revived in expectation of their powerful allies. But to return.   In the same year in which Toledo was taken (a.H. 478) died the King of Saragossa,  Al-muktadir Yusuf Ibn Hud, who was succeeded by his son, Ahmed, who took the honorary  surname of Al-must’ain. In this year died likewise the Wizir Abi Bekr Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz,  who, as we have before noticed, had risen at Valencia, and whom Al-kédir was now trying  to attack and dethrone. After the death of Abi Bekr the city remained for some time  without a ruler, when Al-kédir set off from Toledo with his own army; reinforced by         a & i> i.e. the same capitation-tax usually paid by the Christians living in the Moslem dominions.",613,,
"    XXxXii APPENDIX.    some troops which Alfonso sent him, under the command of Albarhénis (Alvar Yafiez),?'  (may God destroy him!). This expedition took place in the year 480 (beginning April 7,  A.D. 1087). Al-kadir encamped with his host outside of Valencia. At sight of his Christian  auxiliaries the sides of the faithful quaked, and their hearts beat with fear; and they accord-  ingly opened their gates to him, dreading the vengeance of Albarhénis. Al-kddir lodged  the Christian in the suburb called Risdfah, while he himself took up his abode in the interior  of the city.   When the tyrant Alfonso saw himself master of Toledo, his nostrils dilated with pride;  his ambition was kindled, and he imagined that he could easily conquer the rest of Andalus.  To ‘gain this end, he began by making incursions into the districts round Toledo, until he  reduced under his sway all the territories which had once belonged to the Beni Dhi-n-niin,  from Guadalaxara to Talavera, and from the plain of Elche to the district of Santa Maria  (Albarracin); an extent of country comprising eighty principal towns or cities, in every  one of which there was a mosque; besides innumerable villages, farm-houses, and rural  buildings. At this time no chieftain or king in Andalus dared oppose himself to Alfonso,  or arrest his victorious career. On the contrary, all hastened to send their ambassadors  to him, and to place themselves and subjects entirely at his discretion, offering to be  his vassals, and to pay him an annual tribute, provided he would maintain them in the  possession of the cities and provinces in which they had risen. Things even went so far  that Husdmu-d-daulah Ibn Razin, King of Santa Maria (Albarracin), went in person to the  court of Alfonso, and, having made him a splendid and costly present, begged him to confirm  him in his states, promising to hold them in his name. Alfonso accepted the present,  and gave a monkey in return; and they relate that Ibn Razin used to boast of this cir-  cumstance among his comrades, the petty kings of Andalus, asserting that among other  presents offered to him by Alfonso, he had selected that animal, as indicative of the decadence  of the power of that tyrant. But to return.   Elated with success, the Christian king began to assume the titles and to imitate in every  respect the conduct of great monarchs and Cesars. His ambition increased two-fold; and he  surrounded his person with such splendour and magnificence that all mortals appeared  contemptible before him. Seeing the Moslem princes become subservient to him, he took the  title of Emberatir (Imperator), which, in the language of the Christians, means as much as  Amiru-l-mimenin (Commander of the Faithful) with us. Whenever he addressed any of  them in writing, he would style himself “king of the two nations.” Nor did his arrogance  and presumption end here; for, in the presence of the ambassadors residing at his court,  he once swore by his God not to rest until he had exterminated every Moslem prince in  Andalus, or obliged them all to pay him tribute; not to lay down his arms until he had left  them no other place of refuge than his protection; no other resource than a ready sub-  mission. Upon one occasion he said to the ambassador of Ibn ’Abbéd, who was a Jew,  named Ibn Misha’l,® “ How can I allow these madmen to go on with their folly, and              Py AP oe e P A 5  wo Jl Alvar Yaiiez (or Faiicz) Minaya, one of the Companions of the Cid.    2 Pad —which I believe to be Elche in Murcia, 2 ate wy!",614,,

How can I tolerate  “their impudence and presumption in calling themselves Al-mu’tadhed, Al-mu’tamed, Al-  “ mu’tassem, Al-mutawakkel, Al-musta’in, Al-muktadir, Al-amin, Al-mamiin? especially when  “ every one of them seems to be a prey to insanity, and ceases not to oppress his subjects  “and tyrannize over them,—rising in hostile array one against another, indulging in every  “ vice and iniquity, and passing their lives amidst a host of singers and lute-players. I only  “ wonder how men can tolerate such rulers, and trust to such ignorant and negligent shep-  “ herds the care of a flock which they abandon and desert.”   But to resume the thread of our narrative. The Christians prosecuted their victorious  course through the dominions of Islim, invading the territories and towns occupied by  the Moslems, and reducing them under their sway, until the arrogance of the Christian  dogs waxed so great, and the fear of the Moslems became so intense, that a handful of  mounted adventurers were sufficient to overawe a whole province, and to traverse it with  impunity. In this way a band of mounted desperadoes, not exceeding sixty in number, made  a foray into the territory of Almeria, and appeared in sight of that capital. Ibn Samadeh, who  commanded there, having sent against them four hundred of his best troops, under an expe-  rienced general, not only did the infidels await their arrival, but, when attacked, they defeated  the Moslems with awful carnage. At last, when all the chieftains of Andalus, and chiefly  those who held command in the western parts, suc’. as Ibn Al-afttas and Ibn ’Abbad,  became certain of Alfonso’s hostile views, and that neither presents nor tribute would  deter him from the course he intended to pursue, they began to think of returning to  the true path, and calling the Almoravides to their aid. They accordingly implored the  assistance of the Amir of the Moslems, Yusuf Ibn Tashefin, and acknowledged his sway,  hoping that he would stop the victorious course of the infidel, and thus open, for the  prosecution of the holy war, those gates which they had hitherto kept criminally locked.  The Amir, who desired nothing more ardently than an opportunity to make war with the  idolaters, and save from pollution the wives of the Moslems, granted their request, and  answered in the affirmative. Victory then arose from the slumber in which she lay, and  the star of triumph again shone bright amidst the clouds by which it had been obscured.   The Amir hastened to cross the sea with his brothers, the Almoravides, in the year  480 (beginning April 7, a.p. 1087). God had inspired him with the purest intentions,  and directed his mind towards the true path. He filled the seas with fleets, and made  his troops cross the channel, squadron after squadron. He then landed with the flower  of his army, amounting to twelve thousand cavalry, at Jezfrah Al-khadhrd (Algesiras) ; where  he was soon after joined by Al-mu’tamed Mohammed, son of Al-mu’tadhed Ibn ’Abbéd, King  of Seville, by Al-mutawakkel Ibn Al-afttas, King of Badajoz, as well as by other less powerful  chieftains, with all the forces they could muster; besides great numbers of virtuous Moslems,  who privately flocked under his banners for the purpose of taking part in the holy war.   Whilst these preparations were being made, Alfonso was occupied in the siege of Saragossa,         * This date is erroneous. According to the best authorities the landing of Yusuf took place the year before. The author,  no doubt, speaks, by mistake, of Yusuf’s second expedition to Spain, which did really happen in 480.

"    XXxiV APPENDIX. .    which city he had sworn not to quit until he had conquered it. Fate, however, had decided  otherwise. Al-musta’in, who ruled over that city, had repeatedly offered Alfonso large sums  of money if he would raise the siege and retire; but the Christian king refused every overture,  and would grant no terms. In the mean time his emissaries were trying to persuade the  inhabitants that his rule was far preferable to that of Al-musta’in. It had been Alfonso’s  policy, whenever he took a city, to show generosity to the Moslems: he would distribute  justice with an even hand, and would afford the Moslems every sort of protection, treating  them with great kindness in public as well as in private: he would promise never to subject  them to any service that should be incompatible with the sunnah, and in all other respects he  would leave them entirely at liberty.* It was a well-known fact, that after the taking of Toledo  he had distributed among the poor Moslems of that city one hundred thousand dinérs, by  way of alms, and to enable the farmers, who had been ruined by the long-protracted siege, to  purchase seed for their lands: he now made every endeavour to convince the people of  Saragossa that his words were sincere, and that he intended religiously to fulfil his promises.  Thus deceived, the inhabitants were on the point of listening to him, when the news reached  him of the arrival of the Almoravides on the coast of Africa, with the intention of crossing  over to Andalus. Alfonso then’ wrote to Yusuf: “ The petty sovereigns of this country are  “ continually threatening me with thy crossing the sea, and I have promised a reward of ten  “thousand mithkéls of gold to the first man who will bring me the news of thy landing.  “ Hasten therefore to come over to me, or I shall cross the sea and visit thee there. Let  me soon hear thy determination, that I may shape my movements accordingly.” In reply  to this message the Amir of the Moslems wrote Alfonso a letter, wherein, after the bismillah  and the formula in use among us, there were the following remarkable words: “The good  “ sharp swords and the spears have no other messengers than a numerous and well appointed  “ army.”*5 There was not one letter more in the epistle. This answer of the Amir, together  with the intelligence of his having crossed, and his marching towards Toledo, reached Alfonso  at the same time. No sooner was he made certain of it than he dispatched a messenger to  Al-musta’in, offering to raise the siege if he would send him all his disposable money;  but Al-musta’in, who had also heard of the landing of the Almoravides on the coast of  Andalus, denied Alfonso’s request, and would not give him one single dirhem. The accursed,  then, deceived in his expectations, was compelled to raise the siege, and to return, ashamed  and crest-fallen, to Toledo, whence he speedily sent his ambassadors to all the Christian  princes, apprising them of the disembarkation of the Almoravides. He also summoned  the great vassals of his crown to take the field with their retainers. In compliance with his         3% Compare the Cronica General, fo. cccxx.; and Rodericus Toletanus, Hist.

"    APPENDIX, XXXV    orders, the people of Castile bestirred themselves, and numberless troops came to him from  every part of his dominions. Alvar Yajfiez, the general who commanded at Valencia, also left  that city and joined him with all his followers. For some time armies came to him in succes-  sion from the furthermost regions occupied by the Christians. Such was the multitude of  warriors of his race, who on this occasion flocked under Alfonso’s banners, that the valleys  and the mountains were filled with them, and that the infidel monarch himself was  astonished at their numbers. When he saw them all collected round him, his confidence  increased, and he thought himself invincible. He then swore that no one would stand  against so formidable an array, or dare dispute with him the possession of the land. Almighty  God, however, had decreed in his omnipotence that his hopes should be blighted, and his  wicked plans completely frustrated. Alfonso then left Toledo at the head of a numberless  army, to which the wide-spread plains of Andalus afforded scarcely sufficient room, and  resembling the dark shadows of night, or the agitated waves of a tempestuous sea. His  warriors, clad in bright mail, and armed with sharp-edged swords, with steel caps on their  heads, marched, animated with desperate courage, under broad pennons and fluttering banners,  looking like the black gathering clouds on a spotless sky. Victory, however, followed not  in their train, and their formidable host was soon after to be dispersed like the dust before  the hurricane, as we shall presently relate.   In the mean while, the Amir of the Moslems was marching on Toledo with an army so  numerous and well appointed as to call forth the admiration of the most experienced captains.  He met Alfonso not far from Badajoz, at a place called Zalékah, where both armies encamped  at a distance of three miles one from another. Messengers then went from one camp to  the other, with the object of appointing the day on which the sanguinary encounter was to  take place. The accursed Alfonso said, “To-day is Thursday; Friday is a holy day for  “ those of thy creed, as Sunday is one for those of mine; let us then fix on Saturday.” The  Amir of the Moslems then replied, “ Let it be Saturday, if God be pleased.” The accursed  meant by this to deceive the Moslems, and meditated some treason. The Amir of the  Moslems then took up his position close to that of the enemy; his own troops being the  nearest to those of Alfonso, whilst the Andalusian warriors under Ibn ’Abb&d and other  chieftains were behind him. At this juncture Ibn ’Abbéd took an astrolabe,” and ascended  an eminence for the purpose of reconnoitering. Having taken the horoscope of the positions  occupied by the Amir of the Moslems, he came down in haste, and said to Yusuf, “ Thy  position is not an advantageous one.”: Upon which the Amir, after conversing some time  with him, ordered his men to raise the tents, which was done with great secrecy that very  night, so that at sunrise of the following day they were encamped between two hills.  Al-mut’amed then took the horoscope of the new position, and exclaimed, “ A happier  “ position than this I never saw.” However, on Friday before sunrise, notwithstanding  his solemn promise, the accursed Alfonso secretly moved his battalions, and displaying  his two wings as he advanced, fell suddenly on the positions occupied by the Andalusian         ccs erdendl pl jie gu! » 5) 3 Jaw!

The Moslems, not being on their guard, were not made aware of the arrival  of the Christians, until their sharp-edged swords were over their necks and their long spears  in their flanks. They fled accordingly in all directions, filling the plain and the neighbouring  mountains; until Al-mu’tamed, perceiving the confusion and aware of the danger, placed  himself before the fugitives, and like a tawny lion, or like a mad bull butting them with his  horns, checked them in their flight, and made them stand as firm as rocks before the enemy.  The contest lasted for some time, until Al-mu’tamed, who had received some wounds at  the onset, was exhausted, and his men disheartened. The rout then became general; the  Christians followed the Moslems over the plain, killing and taking prisoners for a distance  of eighteen miles.   They say that when the Amir of the Moslems was told of the rout of the Andalusians,  he exclaimed, “ Let them die; they deserve it. The enemy, in the mean time, will be tired,  “and we shall vanquish them without great difficulty.” Accordingly, when the Amir was  made certain that all the Andalusians had either been killed or taken prisoners, he thought  the opportunity had arrived to leave his encampment and spring upon the enemy like a lion  upon his prey. The Christians having, in the ardour of pursuit, left their tents considerably  behind, Yusuf dexterously availed himself of their fault and attacked the camp of Alfonso,  which he entered and plundered, after killing about ten thousand men, between cavalry and  infantry, which the Christian monarch had left for its defence, and in that number were some  of his bravest warriors. This being done, the Amir started off in pursuit of Alfonso, whose  army, as before stated, had gone in various directions in pursuit of the fugitives, and, having  overtaken them, the Moslems began to thrust their swords into their backs and their spears  into their flanks. The Christians, however, did not return their blows; they turned back and  fled precipitately in every direction. In the mean time the accursed Alfonso, seeing the rout  of his army, fled to a neighbouring mountain with about three hundred followers, the only  forces he could collect out of the sixty thousand men with whom he had taken the field. He  there seemed determined to make a stand; but when night came on, and he saw that he could  escape without being molested by the cavalry of the Moslems, he fled from the field of battle  like the timid hare before the chasing dogs, and reached Toledo, beaten, dejected in spirits,  and wounded.   The Moslems then hastened to cut off the heads of the Christian officers, and to build with  them several mounds or towers, from the top of which the muedhins called the soldiers to  prayers for three consecutive days. All those Moslems who had escaped with their lives  then returned to the camp. This memorable battle and defeat of the Christian forces  happened on a Friday the tenth of Rejeb, a.m. 481. It inspired new life into the body  of this island, like a man who, on the point of strangulation, is suffered to take breath. It  confirmed the Moslems in the possession of many wealthy towns and populous districts, and  it taught them that the Christians were not invincible, and could easily be exterminated, if  the Moslems would only follow the right path and rely on their merciful Creator. Soon after         % This is an error; the battle was fought two years before.         ",618,,
"    APPENDIX. xxxvii    this, however, and whilst the Amir of the Moslems was hastening into the heart of the enemy’s  territory, messengers came to him from Africa with letters announcing the death of his  eldest son; and the unexpected calamity so much oppressed his heart, that he decided to  return to Africa, with the full intention of recrossing the sea to Andalus, and following up the  advantages which so signal a victory could not fail to produce to the cause of the Moslems.  Accordingly, having left three thousand cavalry under his general, Abii ’Abdillah Mohammed  Ibnu-l-h4j, to assist Al-mu’tamed in his wars with the Christians, he left Andalus.   No sooner, however, had the Amir of the Moslems taken his departure, when the Anda-  lusian chieftains, who were only kept in awe by his presence, began to show the old symptoms  of animosity one against another, and fresh dissensions broke out among them; for, whilst  some who had witnessed the Amir’s justice and moderation were strongly inclined in his favour  and desired his rule, others showed envy at his military achievements; and, on the other  hand, the Christians having been informed of the Amir’s sudden departure for Africa, decided  to renew their attacks, and, if possible, to snatch from the hands of the Moslems all their  possessions in the eastern parts of Andalus. Accordingly, they began to make incursions  into the districts round Saragossa, and also extended their ravages as far as Valencia, Denia,  Xativa, and Murcia, burning and destroying every thing on their passage, and converting  their fertile and highly cultivated plains into so many houseless deserts. In this manner  they gained possession, among other important fortresses, of Murbiter;? and, whilst the  western districts of Andalus were in comparative security, owing to the auxiliary forces  of the Almoravides, the eastern provinces were a prey to the fury of the enemy.   In the mean time, the Hajib Mundhir Ibn Ahmed Ibn Hiid left Léridah (Lerida) with  a considerable force, and laid siege to Valencia, which he hoped to take from its king,  Al-kédir. When the news of his movement reached his nephew, Al-musta’in, who was  King of Saragossa, he also marched to that capital, on which he had for some time cast  a wistful eye. So eager was he to obtain possession of it, that, not deeming himself  sufficiently powerful to gain his purpose, he so far degraded himself as to seek the  assistance of the Campeador,® (may God send his curses upon him!) and promise him  all the riches of the place if he would only help him to take it. These conditions being  agreed upon, the Campeador took the field with his own troops, amounting to three thousand  men. Having united his forces to those of Al-musta’in, which did not exceed four hundred  horsemen, both chiefs marched upon Valencia. When the Hajib received intelligence of  their approach, he raised the siege, and went away. The Campeador, however, remained in  sight of the city, hovering round it, and keeping up a sort of blockade, until he finally took it,  as we shall hereafter relate.   Within this year, that is to say, in the year 481 (beginning March 26, 1088), the Kéyid  Abi Shajé’ Ibn Lebiin died a martyr for the faith in an encounter with the Christians. The  Khalif Abi-l-mudhaffer*' died also. There was likewise in the same year, in the month of    2 Muri veteres, now Murviedro, the ancient Saguntum,  %  jglauidl] Abcandetor ; that is, Rodrigo Diaz de Bibar, commonly called ‘ the Cid.’    B Xiadadl BI go ole Gus 4 The text must be vitiated; there was no Khalif named Abii-l-mudhatfer about",619,,
"    XXXVili APPENDIX.    Octibir (October), a great flood, which caused considerable damage in Valencia and other  parts of Andalus, and threw down the tower of Alcantara.” About this time too the son of  Ramiro (Sancho), whose power had considerably increased in proportion as that of Alfonso had  diminished owing to his past reverses, seeing that the whole of the Christians were flocking  under his banners, laid siege to Tudela with an army of about four hundred thousand men:  God, however, permitted that he should be defeated, and that the Christians should retire in  utter confusion from before its walls. The son of Ramiro, nevertheless, succeeded in taking  some of the fortresses belonging to Ibn Hiid.   Whilst these events were taking place, King Alfonso was rapidly recovering from the  effects of his past defeat, and his awe of the Moslem arms was gradually vanishing. He  began therefore to raise troops, and to collect provisions and stores for an incursion he  meditated into the Mohammedan provinces. When his preparations had all been completed,  he made public his determination to lay siege to Valencia: to this end he wrote to the people  of Genoa and Pisa to aid him in the undertaking; and they accordingly appeared in sight of  Valencia with a fleet of four hundred sail, whilst Alfonso, on the other hand, after summoning  all the people of his kingdoms, marched upon that capital. So considerable were his pre-  parations, and so numerous and well appointed his army, that the Christian monarch did not  doubt for a moment of the victory, and thought that Valencia and all the coast of Andalus  would soon fall into his hands. The Almighty, however, in his infinite mercy, had decreed  otherwise; and he permitted that division and discord should enter his council, and that  the Christians should shortly after separate without striking a blow, or gaining the least  advantage. In fact, when the Moslems of Valencia had seen Alfonso pitch his tents in  sight of the walls, and were anticipating the fiercest attacks, the next morning saw the  Christian king in full retreat with his innumerable host. The fact was, that when the  Campeador heard that Alfonso was encamped before Valencia, his ire was excited, and he  assembled his followers; for he looked upon Valencia as his own conquest, and on its  king, Al-kédir, as his vassal. Perceiving, however, that he was not sufficiently strong to  contend with Alfonso, and to compel him to give up his undertaking, he decided upon  invading Alfonso’s dominions. He accordingly entered Castile, burning and destroying  every thing before him. This was one of the chief causes of the raising of the siege of  Valencia, and the dispersion of the troops which came for its reduction; for when Alfonso  heard of the march of the Campeador, he returned in all haste to Castile, although he could not  overtake his enemy, the Campeador having by that time left the country. In the mean time  the fleets of Genoa, Pisa, and other maritime states, which had come to assist in the siege  of Valencia, seeing their hopes frustrated, sailed to Tortosa. They were there met by Ibn  Radmir, Count of Barcelona (Sancho Ramirez), who, wishing to gain possession of that impor-  tant city, engaged their services; but Almighty God was pleased to breathe courage into its  defenders, and, after battering the walls for some time, the Christians were compelled to    this time. Al-muktad{-billah, son of Al-kéyem-billah, the twenty-third Khalif of the house of ’Abbés, reigned then in the  East; and he did not die till 487. He does not appear, moreover, to have had the surname of Abu-l-mudhaffer (the father  of the victorious). See Hist.

After this the Campeador  made another incursion into the territory of Valencia, and laid siege to the city; but the storm  was a second time averted, by the inhabitants consenting to pay him an annual tribute  of one thousand mithkdls.   In this year also, the Christians of every denomination, being possessed by a strong desire to  conquer the whole of Andalus, attacked the Moslems in every province. King Garcia®* laid  siege to Almeria, Al-fanah,™ and Lorca, which he reduced to the last extremity. Alvar Yafiez  attacked Murcia; the Campeador, Xativa. Al-mu’tamed then dispatched (against the latter)  his son, Ar-rédhf, with three thousand cavalry. Ar-rédhi met the enemy of God, (may  the curses of the Almighty come down upon him!) who, being only three hundred strong,  fled precipitately on the approach of the Moslems; but they were, however, overtaken, their  camp was plundered and destroyed, and numbers of them were either killed or remained  prisoners in the hands of the true believers. About this time a bishop of the Franks built on  the sea-shore the castle of Shashenah: * the Almoravides, who were in Seville, being informed  of it, their souls were inflamed with martial ardour. Having appointed as their general the  Kayid Mohammed Ibn ’A’yeshah, they marched to Murcia, and meeting on their way to  that city some of the enemy’s forces, they routed them, killing and taking numbers of  them prisoners. Ibn ’A’yeshah then proceeded to Murcia, which city he entered, depriving  the ruler there of all command. From Murcia Ibn ’A’yeshah went to Denia, where he  intended doing the same; but Ibn Mujéhid, who reigned in it, took to flight, and crossed the  sea to Africa, where he placed himself under the protection of An-nédsir Ibn ’Alnés,  a prince of the dynasty known as the Beni Hammad of Senhdjah, by whom he was well  received and hospitably entertained. Ibn ’A’yeshah then entered Denia. While he was  commanding there, Ibn Jehéf, Kadi of Valencia, came to ask him to go to that city with him,  and take possession of it. Ibn ’A’yeshah would not quit Denia, but gave Ibn Jehéf some  troops, under the command of a general of his, the Kéyid Abi Nasr, when both marched  to Valencia, and put to death King Al-kédir in the year 485 (beginning Feb. 11, a.p. 1092).  When the news of Al-kédir’s death reached the Campeador, who was then besieging Sara-  gossa, his anger was kindled, and his soul was inflamed; for he considered the besieged city  as his, and King Al-kédir as his tributary; since, as we have already stated, that monarch  paid him an annual tribute of one hundred thousand dinérs. The Campeador left Saragossa,  and hastened to Valencia. Having arrived in sight of the city, he began to batter the  walls, until, after a siege of twenty months, he stormed it, the inhabitants having been  reduced to the last extremity through want of provisions. So great, they say, was the  famine, that a mouse sold for one dinér. The taking of Valencia by the Campeador  happened in the year 487 (beginning Jan. 30, a.p. 1094).   During these transactions a number of low, dissolute, and contemptible Moslems, with  whom crime and impiety were a constant practice, deserted our ranks, and enlisted under         S There was about this time no king of this name in Spain: Garcia III. of Navarre had died in 1054.

"    xl APPENDIX.    the banners of the Campeador and other Christian chieftains. These wretches, who were  at the time called Dawdyir (deserters), having swelled the ranks of the infidels, began,  in union with them, to make incursions into the countries inhabited by the Moslems,  polluting the harems, killing the men, and taking into captivity the women and children.  Most of them went even so far as to forsake Islam, and to disregard the principal injunctions  of our Prophet, selling their comrades and countrymen for a loaf of bread or a pitcher of  wine, or a pound of fish; and seizing on the defenceless Moslems for the purpose of extorting  from them heavy ransoms. If their prisoners, moreover, happened to be poor, they would  cut out their tongues, or pluck off their eyelids, and then leave them exposed to be devoured  by infuriated blood-hounds, or commit upon them other such like atrocities. The bands com-  manded by Alvar Yafiez (may God send down his malediction on him and his followers!)  were the most remarkable of all for their cruelty and excesses; for, on coming to a town, they  would seize upon all its inhabitants and cut off the virilia of the men and the breasts of the  women; the Moslems who served under the banners of the accursed Christian being the  first to perpetrate these and other atrocious crimes, and to inflict such unparalleled cruelties  upon the people of their faith.   In this manner war raged without intermission throughout the Mohammedan provinces,  until the general of the Almoravides, Seyr Ibn Abi Bekr, having heard of the attacks made by  the idolaters upon the worshippers of the true and only God, and of the ravages they were  daily committing in their towns and provinces, collected his forces and sallied out against  Alvar Yafiez, whom he completely defeated, God making him his instrument to humble the  arrogance and break down the courage of that accursed chieftain. The news of this success  filled the Christians with consternation. They perceived, to their cost, how dangerous it was  to come in contact with the Almoravides, and they accordingly desisted from their attacks.  But Ibn ’Abbéd and the other Andalusian princes hated Seyr and his followers; and such were  their want of virtue and justice, their excessive ambition, and their dissensions, that they  could not tolerate the presence of the Almoravides, and wished to get rid of them at any  price: they began therefore to plot treason against them and to meditate their ruin. To this  end they entered into a secret correspondence with Alfonso, and offered to deliver into his  hands the whole of the Almoravides on condition that he would leave them unmolested  in possession of their respective states, they paying: him an annual tribute in token of  vassalage. Alfonso having agreed to these propositions, every one of them prepared to carry  their wicked and treacherous projects into execution. Accordingly, when the Amir of the  Moslems crossed over to Andalus for the second®™ time, for the purpose of prosecuting the  holy war against the infidels, they threw every obstacle in his way. They compelled him to  besiege Malaga, Granada, and Almeria, and raised up against him enemies in other places,  in order that their plans might be better accomplished, and the hopes of the enemy of God  realized. However, the Amir of the Moslems marched on Granada, and encamped in its vici-  nity. ’Abdullah Ibn Badis Ibn Habis, who reigned in that city, at first thought of resisting.  His mother said to him, “ Go out and salute thy uncle Yusuf.” ’Abdullah followed her         % Instead of ‘second,’ read ‘third.’",622,,

He had saluted the Amfr with all due respect, and was preparing  to retire, when he was prevented, and conducted by the orders of Ytisuf to a separate  tent, where heavy irons were put on his feet. The Amir then rode on to Granada, and,  took possession of it without resistance. The people, far from blaming Yusuf for this  treacherous act, and his device to secure the person of *Abdullah, and gain possession of  his capital, were rejoiced at it, because he had run counter to the designs of his secret  enemies, and defeated their plans. But the fact is, that Yusuf was ignorant of the conspiracy  formed against him, and that, when he crossed to Andalus this time, he came with a  full intention to disclose before the Moslems the shameful conduct and wicked practices  of their rulers, and to look for an opportunity to lay his hand on their dominions.   After the taking of Granada, Yusuf sent an army to Almeria. Ibn Samédeh, who com-  manded there, waited not its approach, but took to sea, and went to place himself under  the protection of An-nésir Ibn Al-mansir, a Sultén of the Beni Hamméd, who not only  received him kindly, and entertained him with magnificence, but went so far as to confer  great favours on all those persons who came in his suite.   The Amir then sent Seyr to Seville, with instructions to take the command from the hands  of Al-mu’tamed Ibn ’Abbéd, and, if possible, to secure his person; bidding him put to  death such as should oppose him, whether citizens or soldiers. Some authors pretend that  the Amir issued no such orders, as he had, upon a certain occasion, solemnly promised Al-  mu’tamed upon his oath, never to dispossess him, unless the Theologians, the Kédis, the  officers of the troops, and the principal citizens, should desire him to do so. However, Seyr  marched to Seville, which he besieged and took, depriving Al-mu’tamed Ibn ’Abbéd of  the command. He then did the same with Ibn Al-afttas, King of Badajoz, and reduced the  whole of Al-gharb (the Western Provinces) under his sway. The cities of Murcia, Almeria,  Denia, and Xativa, had already fallen into the hands of another of his generals, the Kéyid Ibn  ?A’yeshah, as before related. After these conquests the Amir of the Moslems crossed over to  the opposite coast.   In the year 490 (beginning December 18, A.p. 1096,) the Amir of the Moslems visited  Andalus for the third time, and fixed his residence in Cordova. Having, whilst there, heard  that Alfonso was marching against him, he exclaimed, “ I shall never meet him again as long  “as I live, because defeats are creatures of God, and I gave him a sufficiency the year I met  “him at Zalékah.” I will, however, send my generals against him, with my best troops;  “ and if God has decreed that they should be defeated, I will be behind them like a cloak, to  “ cover their retreat.” He accordingly collected a numerous army of Almoravides, Arabs,  and Andalusians, from the eastern and western parts of the country, the command of which he  gave to Mohammed Ibnu-l-haj, one of his generals. The two hosts met at a place called  Kabethuwah,” where there was manceuvring and charging until Almighty God was pleased to  throw into confusion the vanguard of the enemy, and they fled before the Moslems, who pur-  sued them closely, sword in hand, dealing death amongst them.

"    xiii APPENDIX.    returned to Cordova safe, and loaded with plunder. The Amir was greatly delighted at  the victory, and made preparations to return to his dominions across the sea. Before  shis departure for Africa, Yiisuf had sent an army, under the command of Mohammed Ibn  °A’yeshah, to make war on the infidels in the neighbourhood of Konkah (Cuenca).*° Mo-  hammed met there the accursed Alvar Yafiez, defeated him, and plundered and destroyed his  camp, after which the Almoravides returned home victorious, receiving every where on  their passage the congratulations of the inhabitants.   Mohammed’s next expedition was directed towards Jezfrah Shukar (the island on the  river Xucar), which the Christians had attacked some time before. He there fell in  with a division of the army of the Campeador, which he almost exterminated, as few escaped  on that memorable day from the swords of the Almoravides. When the news of this disaster  was brought to the Campeador, he shortly after died of sorrow and disappointment.“ (May  God not show him mercy !).   In the year 493 (beginning Nov. 16, a.p. 1099,) the Amir Yahya Ibn Abi Bekr,® son  of the Amir of the Moslems, Yusuf Ibn T4shefin, crossed over to Andalus for the purpose of  prosecuting the holy war against the infidels. He came, accompanied by the Amir Seyr  Ibn Abi Bekr and by Mohammed Ibnv-I-héj, at the head of their respective forces; and all  three marched to Toledo, which they besieged, making incursions into the neighbouring  districts. In this manner they took several castles, made numerous prisoners, and collected  considerable spoil; after which they returned victorious [to Africa].   In the year 494 (beginning November 5, a.p. 1100,) the Amir Yahya Ibn Abi Bekr  again crossed over to Andalus, with a numerous army, to make war on the enemy of God.  This time he marched against Valencia, which he besieged for seven months; until Alfonso,  perceiving the sufferings of the garrison, and being fearful of the consequences, arrived with  a powerful army, and, having taken out all the Christians who were within, set fire to the city  and abandoned it, the Almoravides taking possession of it immediately after. By the reduc-  tion of Valencia, Ytisuf Ibn Téshefin saw himself master of the whole of Andalus, with the  exception of Saragossa, which remained in the hands of its king, Al-musta’in Ibn Hid.  The Almoravides dared not molest this prince, on account of the great distance of his  kingdom, and of his being in league with the Christians, whose tributary he was.   After this, Modhdelf, who had remained as Governor of Valencia, attacked the territory of  Barcelona,** pulled down the churches, made the belfries shake to their foundations, burnt  the towns and hamlets, dispersed their garrisons, and stormed the castles; after which he  returned to Valencia, the hands of the Moslems being filled with the spoils of the infidel.         » ELS   © Bs by 15> now Alcira, a corruption from Al-jezfrah.

The bells he caused to be  suspended from the ceiling of the principal mosque at Valencia, to be used as lamps.   In the same year ’Ali Ibnu-1-héj sallied from Cordova, taking with him Ibn Yakhiin “ and  his division. They marched together to the land of Castile, where they were met by the  accursed Errink (Henry of Besancon ?) at the head of considerable forces, when they fought  with him the battles of extermination. After this another general of the Almoravides made  a foray into the territory of Kala’t-Ayib: having there met with a body of Christians, he  put them to shameful flight, and plundered and destroyed a fortified camp wherein they had  entrenched themselves; when, after making numbers of prisoners and collecting considerable  spoil, the Moslems under his orders returned home, rejoiced at their success.   In the year 497 (beginning October 4, a.p. 1103,) the Amir of the Moslems returned to  Andalus, this being the fourth and last expedition which he made into that country: on this  occasion he reached as far as Murcia. He removed Modhdeli from the government of  Valencia, which he gave to the Kéyid Abi Mohammed Ibn Faétimah. The Amir Modhdeli  he appointed to be Governor of Telemsén, in the room of Téshefin Ibn Yatanghmor, with  whom he was displeased, owing to his intimacy and close connexion with the dynasty of the  Beni Hamméd.   In the same year, that is, in 497, there came to the Amir of the Moslems letters from  Al-musta’in Ibn Hiid, King of Saragossa, imploring his help against the tyrant Alfonso,  who kept him closely besieged in his capital, and had nearly reduced him to the last ex-  tremity.“ Agreeably to his wishes, the Amir sent him one thousand picked horsemen, under  the orders of the Kéyid Abdullah Ibn Fatimah, who not only relieved Al-musta’in from his  perilous situation, but made an inroad into the country of the infidels, whence he returned  victorious and loaded with spoil.   In the same year (a.H. 497) the Kéyid Mohammed Ibn ’A’yeshah met the enemies of God  at Fahs Al-lej (Elche ?), close to Balétt Al-ards, and gained a signal victory over them. He  also took from them the town of Suleymén, and the hands of his men were filled with the  spoil taken from the infidels.   In the same year (a.H. 497) the Amir of the Moslems arrived in Granada, with his son,  the Amfr ’Alf, for the purpose of having him sworn to and acknowledged as sovereign of  Andalus.“ This being done, he returned to his dominions in Africa, after subjecting to  his rule the whole of this island, with the exception of Saragossa, which still remained in  the hands of Al-musta’in.   In the year 500 (beginning Sept. 1, a.p. 1106,) died the Amir of the Moslems, Yusuf  Ibn Téshefin. He was succeeded by his son ’Ali, who, immediately after his accession,         * oF yl  “ The author says, with great elegance, aie, 51 we A 9 tice?

"    xliv: APPENDIX.    dispatched to Andalus a chosen body of troops under the command of two of his generals,  the Kéyid Abii Suleymén and the Kéyid Abt *Imrén, two brothers, who were the sons  of Téreshené. These chiefs marched against the districts of Santa Maria and Ar-rayéhir,*  where, as well as in many other parts of the enemy’s territory, they made several successful  inroads, whereby the hands of their men were filled with plunder.   In the ensuing year, 501, (beginning August 21, a.p. 1107,) Alfonso called together the  people of his kingdom, and, having mustered a large army, invaded the eastern provinces  of Andalus. He was met by the Amir Temim, when the two hosts manceuvred, skirmished,  fought, and destroyed each other, until God Almighty was pleased graciously to grant  the victory to the Moslems, and to permit that the arrogant Christian should take to  flight, after losing one of his sons, and being himself wounded in the onset. (May the  curses of God rest upon them both!). Great was the chastisement inflicted upon the  enemy of God on this memorable occasion; since, between those killed in the engage-  ment, and the prisoners, who were very numerous, the army of the infidel king was  annihilated. The Moslems returned to their homes victorious, elated with success, and proud  of having received so signal a proof of the Almighty’s favour; while the Christian tyrant  (may the curses of God fall upon his head!) retired to his dominions, confused and hu-  miliated at his defeat, and broken-hearted at the loss of his son. Three months after  these events the accursed Alfonso died, God being pleased to deliver the Moslems from  his mischief. His body was carried to Castile on the shoulders of his own men, and  there buried by the side of those of his ancestors. He left no male child; but he had  a daughter,’ who succeeded him in the kingdom, which she administered at first with  great firmness and skill. But, fearing lest her dominions should be invaded by some  Christian or Mohammedan king among her neighbours, she secretly sent to the son of  Ramiro (Alfonso), and offered him her hand. The proposition was accepted, and the  marriage took place: but no happiness or joy ensued from it; for they had been married  but a short time, when discord broke out between them, and they separated on the worst  possible terms. Her husband then left her, and retired into his own dominions; and having  there called together his vassals, he invaded the kingdom of his wife, who, on her side,  had also taken up arms, and went out to meet him. In this manner they waged a desultory  war against each other, until the queen gained a signal victory over her husband, and  routed his army, with the death of upwards of three thousand of his bravest warriors.  After this the queen espoused one of the counts *! of her own kingdom, and had by him one  son, called As-soleytan (the little king).

In the year 503 (beginning July 30, a.p. 1109,) the Amir ’Ali Ibn Ytisuf crossed over to  Andalus for the purpose of waging war with the infidels. He landed at Algesiras with a  numerous and well appointed army, and took the road to Toledo. Arrived before that city,  he encamped in front of the principal gate, and fixed his quarters at a well known pleasure-  house outside the walls.‘ He then made himself master of some of the outer defences, and  ravaged the neighbouring districts by means of bodies of light cavalry, which he sent in  various directions. Seeing this, the Christians fled for refuge to the castles, towers, and  fortresses nearest to them: terror then seized on the Castilians, and fear lodged in their  hearts; for they doubted not that the Amir would prosecute his victorious career and pounce  upon them, and demolish the places whither they had fled to escape his vengeance. How-  ever, it was not as they apprehended; for the Amir, having suddenly raised the siege,  approached the sea, and crossed over to the seat of his African dominions.   In the same year, Errink (Henry of Besangon) and the son of Ramiro (Alfonso I. of Aragon)  (may the Almighty’s curses fall upon the heads of both!) invaded the territory of Al-musta’in  Ibn Hid with an army, the numbers of which are only known to God. Al-musta’in hastened  to the defence of his states, but fate had decided against him, and he fell a martyr in an  encounter with the Christians. (May God have mercy on him!). After this, the son of Ramiro  besieged Saragossa for a whole month, during which time the inhabitants were exposed to all  manner of misery and tribulation, until the people of the town, unable to withstand his  attacks any longer, consented to surrender on condition that those among the inhabitants  who chose to remain might do so unmolested on the payment of a certain annual tribute  which was stipulated; and that those who preferred leaving the town should be allowed to go  to whatever part of the country, inhabited by the Moslems, they most liked, with all their :  goods and chattels. It was further stipulated that the Christians should dwell in the city  itself, and that such among the Moslems, as chose to remain, should inhabit the suburb  called Rabadhu-d-dabbdghin (the suburb of the tanners) ; that if a Christian recognised among  the inhabitants a runaway slave, the Moslem should not be given up to him, but should  be free, as if he had never been taken, and should live in the full enjoyment of his rights and  the exercise of his religion, his master possessing no dominion whatever over him. These  conditions being agreed to by both parties, and each having promised on oath to fulfil them, ;  the Moslems gave up the keys of the city to the son of Ramiro. Thus was the mighty city  of Saragossa, one of the vital members of the corrupted body of Islém, torn away, never to  form again an integral part of it. There is no power but in God! the Almighty, the  Illustrious! He whose wisdom is unbounded, and whose impenetrable decrees no creature on  the earth can pretend to unravel!   No sooner had the accursed Christians taken possession of the city, than the greater part  of the inhabitants fled to other parts of the country occupied by the Moslems. They say,   4         Now Las Casas de la Reyna, formerly a villa belonging to the Benf Dhf-n-nén kings of that city. See vol. i.  pp. 239, 384.",627,,
"    xlvi APPENDIX.    that the number of persons who left Saragossa on this occasion exceeded fifty thousand,  between great and small, males and females. When all this multitude were ready to depart,  the Christian king rode out of the city with his officers and escort: having appeared in front  of the emigrants, he ordered them to form into lines, and to exhibit before him whatever  property, whether large or small, each man carried with him. This being done, there were  shown treasures without computation; and yet, strange to say, though the king knew very  well that as long as he lived his eyes would never again feast on such a mass of riches, he  refrained from taking any, and said to them, “ Had I not asked to see the property each of you  “ carries with him, you might have said, ‘ The king knew not what we had, otherwise he would  * not have let us go so easily.” Now you may go whither you please in perfect security.” The  king, moreover, sent a body of his own troops to escort the emigrants to the frontiers of his  dominions, which they all reached in safety, and without being subjected to the payment of  any other tax or tribute than two mithkdls, which every man, woman, or child was obliged to  pay before starting. From that day, until that of his death, God permitted that this insolent  Christian should always be victorious against the Moslems. But to return.   Some time before the city surrendered to the Christians, a son of the king, Al-musta’in  Ibn Hiid, whose surname was ’Imddu-d-daulah (the column of the state), left Saragossa  secretly, and took refuge in a neighbouring castle named Rotah.* This castle, which was  exceedingly strong, was situated on the top of a high inaccessible mountain: so high was the  mountain, that it looked as if it were borrowing the reins of the sky. The fortress had  been erected by his father, Al-musta’in, who had filled it with stores, and provided it with  every thing necessary for a long siege: it was supplied with water by means of a subter-  raneous passage built of solid masonry, leading from the castle down to the river by upwards  of four hundred steps, so that the garrison could never be short of water. In this place  *Im4du-d-daulah passed a few years, secure from the infidels, until death came to surprise  him. (May God have mercy on him!).   ?Imédu-d-daulah was succeeded by his son Ahmed, who took the surname of Al-muntaser.  This prince once received an embassy from the Christian tyrant, Al-enberatir (the emperor), sur-  named ‘the little Sultén.’? The message was thus conceived: “If thou wilt give me possession  of Rotah, I will give thee instead more extensive and better dominions in Castile, which  “ ghall bring thee closer to the western provinces of Andalus, inhabited by thy countrymen.  “ T will then place myself at the head of my troops, and we will both make an incursion into  “ those districts, and reduce them into obedience to thee. Those towns that shall voluntarily  * acknowledge thee as their lord, shall hereafter remain under thy dominion and authority,  “and I promise thee to defend them against all aggressors, whether Moslems or Christians,  “ and to be unto them as a kind and affectionate father. I hope not one will resist thee,  “ oppressed as they are by the Almoravides, and subjected to all manner of indignities by  “them. They all detest their rule, and wish for the restoration of the Mohammedan empire,  “now prostrate. Were the Almoravides to lay their hands on thy person, there would  remain not one man whose call they might obey, thou being the only descendant from their         i iby, Now Roda.    ",628,,
"    APPENDIX. ; xlvii    * ancient kings in the whole of Andalus.” These words lodged in Ahmed’s head, and had  the desired effect upon his mind: he delivered his fortress into the hands of Alfonso, and the  king gave him an equivalent in towns and lands. After this, he placed himself at the head of  a numerous and well appointed army, and invaded the Mohammedan settlements in the  western provinces of Andalus, as he had promised. His hopes and those of Ahmed, however,  were far from being realized; for, wherever they went, they met with resistance and ill-will,  the inhabitants deserting their homes at their approach. Not a soul stirred to do him  homage; not a hamlet, of the many traversed in their march, greeted them; nor did the *  news of their arrival spread over the country, as had been anticipated. The people were, no  doubt, afraid lest by swearing obedience to Ahmed they should fall a prey to the Christians  who came with him, and the whole should be a device to catch them and put them to death.  Had not these fears preyed on their minds, they would undoubtedly have hastened to do  homage to Ahmed; for they were anxiously expecting his arrival, and he had, no doubt, a  considerable party in the country. As it was, he failed most completely in his attempt, and  he had to return home more dejected and low-spirited than Abii Ghabashén himself.   In the year 507 (beginning June 17, a.p. 1113,) the Amir Seyr Ibn Abi Bekr and the  Almoravide Modhdeli made an incursion into the territory of Toledo, and appeared in sight of  that city. Having there divided their armies into several small detachments, they sent them  out in various directions, and began pulling down houses, killing the inhabitants, burning  their fields, and laying waste every thing before them. Alvar Yafiez then sallied out at the  head of ten thousand men at arms; but he was met by the Moslems, who defeated him, with  the loss of seven hundred of his mounted followers. In the same year a war broke out  between the Castilians and the son of Ramiro (Alfonso), when both parties made one another  taste of the cup of perdition. In one of these encounters the accursed Alvar Yafiez was  killed, and his soul was immediately consigned by the Almighty to the raging fire of hell.   In the year 508 (beginning June 6, a. p. 1114,) the people of Pisa and Genoa assembled  together, and, having fitted out a fleet of three hundred sail, made for the island of Yébisah  (Iviza), which they took and plundered, making captives of the inhabitants. Iviza is an  island close to, and under the jurisdiction of, Mallorca. From Iviza the Christians sailed to  the latter island, which they attacked both by sea and land.   The island of Mallorca had for many years been governed by independent chieftains. The  first was an Andalusian named Al-murtadhi, who, on the overthrow of the Umeyyah dynasty,  when the governors rose in every province, followed their example, assumed the supreme  power, and reigned for a while independent in the island. He was succeeded at his death by  one of his eunuchs, whose name was Mubashsher, but who assumed on his accession to power  the honorific surname of Nédsiru-d-daulah (the preserver of the state). This Mubashsher was         He Col pe Eto pal 22) gba Ghabashén was the door-keeper of the Ka’bah whilst the custody    of that building was in the hands of the tribe of Khozé’h, to which he himself belonged.

The humiliation and disappointment of Abi Ghabashén, when he recovered and found himself without  the keys intrusted to his keeping, afterwards became proverbial among the Arabs.

It happened that Al-murtadhi once sent  an ambassador to the court of the Christian king,** to settle various matters pending between  them: whilst there, the ambassador made the acquaintance of Mubashsher, and being much  struck with his affable manners, his intelligence, and his ready wit, paid his ransom, and took  him with him on his return to Mallorca: he then presented him to Al-murtadhi, who was  highly pleased with him, placed him near his person, gave him his confidence, and always found  him a zealous and trusty servant. At the death of his master, Mubashsher succeeded him.  He governed with moderation and justice, was noble-minded and generous, and possessed many  virtues and noble qualities: he was still reigning when, as already related, the people of Pisa  and Genoa landed on the island, and besieged his capital; and he not only exhibited the  greatest courage during the siege, but his perseverance and fortitude in making war on the  infidels were beyond all praise. Mubashsher died while the Christians were still on the island.  He was succeeded by a relative of his, named Abi Rabi’ Suleymén, who followed in his steps,  and stoutly defended the island, until the Christians gained possession of it. Some time  before his death, Nasiru-d-daulah, perceiving that he could not long withstand the attacks of  the enemy, decided on writing to the Amir of the Moslems, imploring his assistance. Abt  ?Abdillah Ibn Maymiun, the captain of a carabel then in the port, having consented to be the  bearer of the message, every precaution was taken for his leaving the island unperceived by  the enemy. Ibn Maymin sallied secretly and at night from the arsenal: his flight being  discovered by the Christians, some of their galleys weighed anchor, and went off in pursuit  of him; but, after a chase of nearly ten miles, Ibn Maymiin, protected by night, contrived  to escape, and the Christians, despairing of success, returned to their anchorage in sight  of Mallorca. Ibn Maymin, moreover, arrived safe in Africa, and delivered his letter to the  Anfr of the Moslems, who issued orders for the immediate fitting out of three hundred sail.  The commands of the Amir were punctually executed, and in a very short time the above  number of vessels, together with many others which happened to be ready on the arrival of  Ibn Maymiin, put to sea. No sooner were the Christians made aware of the departure of so  formidable an armament, than they desisted from their undertaking, and put off to sea, taking  away with them, however, so much plunder, and so many captives, that they departed highly  satisfied and content. When the Moslem fleet arrived in sight of the island, they found the  city in ruins, and the streets deserted; every thing round it bore the appearance of desolation  and ruin. Seeing this, Ibn Téfertés, who came in command of the fleet, ordered the Almo-  ravides, and the other soldiers and sailors who composed the expedition, to set about  rebuilding the city. This was done, when the people who had fled to the mountains returned :  the city was rebuilt as before, and repeopled ;. many of the soldiers, who had accompanied the  expedition, agreeing to settle in it. The fleet then returned to the port whence it had been  taken. As the Christians were returning to their country, they were assailed by a storm,  which separated their galleys, and cast four of their number on the coast of Denia; which  being perceived by the people of that town, they went out in chase of them, and succeeded in  capturing three, and sinking the other.         5 No doubt, the Count of Barcelona. % The island had in the mean time been taken and plundered by the Christians.

"         APPENDIX. xlix    APPENDIX D.    Extracts from the history of the Berbers by Abi Zeyd ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Ibn Khaldin (Brit.  Mus. No. 9575), respecting the conquests and settlements of the Al-muwdhhedtn (or Almo-  hades) in Spain.   Tuts part of Al-makkari’s narrative is so short, his information 80 scanty and unsatisfactory, that I have   considered it necessary to translate here such passages from the work of the above celebrated and most   accurate historian as were likely to throw a light upon the events recorded in the body of this work,  especially as the period to which they relate is perhaps the most interesting, as it is the most obscure, in  the annals of Mohammedan Spain.    An account of the conquest of Andalus by the Almohades, and the events attending thereon.    Fo. 106, verso.—When the intelligence of the death of Tashefin Ibn ’Ali,! and the siege of  Fez by the Almohades, was received by the Almoravides of Andalus, ’Ali Ibn *Isa Ibn  Maymin, the commander of their fleet, shook off their yoke, and embraced the party of the  Almohades. Having risen in revolt at the island of Kddis (Cadiz), he crossed over to Africa,  joined ’Abdu-l-muimen before Fez, and placed himself under the orders of that Sultén, whom  he had previously caused to be proclaimed from [the pulpit of] the great mosque at Cadiz;  this being the first proclamation that was made in Andalus for the Almohades. This hap-  pened in 540 (beginning June 23, a.p. 1145). Ahmed Ibn Kas‘,? Lord of Mirtolah (Mertola),  was the next chieftain to proclaim in Andalus the supremacy of the Almohades. This done,  he sent Abi Bekr Ibn Khanisen® with a message to ’Abdu-l-mimen. Abd Bekr met that  Sultan near Telemsdn, and delivered into his hands his master’s credentials; but ’Abdu-l-  miumen, being dissatisfied with the manner in which the name of the Mahdi was mentioned in  his letter, sent no reply to it. Subsequently to this, Seddaray ‘¢ Ibn Wazir, Lord of Badajoz,         1 The last of the Almoravide Sultans. He was put to death near Wahr4n (Oran) on the 27th day of Ramadhan, 539  (March 23rd, 1145).    2 Tbnu Khaldan treats of this chieftain in his historical Prolegomena, sect. iii, in the chapter entitled 35 wl o AP   fal y Saas pe vw da oll (That religious revolutions unsupported by clanship do not succeed). He says that  7 >   his entire name was Abd-l-késim Ahmed Ibnu-l-huseyn Ibn ws Kasf, (elsewhere written ot Kisi and od Kosa) ;    that he made himself conspicuous among his countrymen for the austerity of his life, and wrote a work entitled =!    ya] Ary eat! (The putting off of the two slippers on the doctrines of the Sufis); that he called the people to [the    knowledge of] truth, and was followed by numerous disciples, to whom he gave the name of 4l-mordbetin. He was himself  a disciple of Abi, Hamid Al-ghazz4l{; and, as such, the doctrines which he preached were not dissimilar to those of the Mahdi.  Profiting by the civil wars which distracted Mohammedan Spain at the commencement of the twelfth century, he made    himscif master of a considerable portion of Al-gharb (Algarbe). 2 si : we  ‘ j _- ie id-Ray. . ii. pp. 27 0, im.

Beja, and the western districts of Andalus, having quarrelled with Ahmed Ibn Kasi, made war  against him, and came off victorious, taking from him the city of Mertola; upon which the  latter chieftain, who was on intimate terms with Ibn Maymin [’Ali Ibn ’Isa], decided to  cross over to Africa, and [following the example of his friend] to put himself under the com-  mand of ’Abdu-l-mimen, who had just taken possession of Morocco. Accordingly, Ibn Kasi  landed at Ceuta, where he resided some time: thence Yusuf Ibn Makhlif [the governor] sent  him on with an escort to the camp of ’Abdu-l-mtimen, whom he saw and spoke.to, inviting  him to undertake the conquest of Andalus, and to expel the Almoravides therefrom. ’Abdu-l-  mtmen listened to his propositions, and sent an army of Almohades under the command of  Berréz Ibn Mohammed Al-masifi, the same who towards the close of the reign of Téshefin  deserted the cause of that Sultan, and went over to the Almohades. To this general, ’Abdu-l-  miimen intrusted the subjection of the Lamtinites of Andalus, as well as that of the other rebels  in that country who acknowledged no authority at all: he re-inforced his army with another  division, under the command of Abi Imrén Misa Ibn Sa’id, and subsequently with a second,  at the head of which he placed ""Omar Ibn Saleh As-senhdji. On the landing of these forces  on the coast of Andalus, their first destination was against a rebel named Abi-l-ghamr Ibn  Gharin,* who had taken possession of Xerez and Ronda. After the reduction of these, the  army marched to Liblah (Niebla), which city was in the hands of another rebel named Yusuf  Al-betréhi, who hastened to make his submission: thence they proceeded to Mertola, which  city [was not attacked], being considered by the Almohades as under their rule, owing to  Ibn Kasi [its former lord] having previously subscribed to the dogma of the unity of God  [as preached by the Mahdi]. The army then continued its march to Shelb (Silves), which  city was ‘taken by storm, and given over to Ibn Kasi: thence they directed their course  towards Beja and Badajoz; but the lord of those two cities, Seddaray Ibn Wazir, hastened to  place himself under their rule. This done, Berréz retired with his army to Mertola, where he  wintered, until, on the approach of the fine season, he sallied out to lay siege to Seville. On  his march to that city he received the allegiance of the garrisons of Tablada® and Hisn  Al-kasr, which submitted to him. Being afterwards joined by the forces of several chieftains  who had before this risen in open rebellion against the Almoravides, Berréz invested Seville  by sea and land, and took that mighty city in the month of Sha’ban of the year 541 (Jan. or  Feb. a.p. 1147).7 The Almoravides who composed the garrison fied to Carmona, not  without being closely pursued by the victors, who dealt death among them. In the confusion  occasioned by the entrance of the Almohades into Seville, a son of the K&di Abi Bekr  Ibnu-l~arabi was unintentionally killed by one of the besieging army.   On the taking of Seville, an embassy composed of several distinguished individuals, at the  head of whom was the Kadi Abi Bekr Ibnu-l-’arabi, was sent to Africa to inform ’Abdu-l-         5 This name is differently written in various parts of this work, thus: use pel geo wt rw y!  and ws Fa w Conde calls him Abu-l-hamri (vol. ii. p. 325,) and Abu-l-camar (p. 313).

"    APPENDIX. li    mimen of the success of his arms. The messengers reached Morocco, and presented them-  selves to the Sultén, who accepted of the obedience they tendered to him in the name of their  fellow-citizens, and dismissed them with suitable presents and pensions [upon his treasury].  This took place in the year 542 (beginning June 1, a.p. 1147). As Abi Bekr was returning  to his native country, he died on the road, and was buried at Fez.   It happened about this time that two brothers of the Mahdi, named ’Abdu-l~aziz and ’Isa,  who resided at Seville, and held high command in the army, were guilty of great cruelty  and excess: they stretched out their hands over the inhabitants, seized on their property,  shed their blood, and practised every iniquity and injustice. Having conceived an enmity  against Yusuf Al-betrihi, governor of Niebla, who was then dwelling in Seville, they formed  the design of ridding themselves of him by treason; but that chief, having received intel-  ligence of their plans in time, quitted the city, and took refuge in the capital of his dominions,  whence he expelled the Almohades, and declared himself in open revolt against *Abdu-l-muimen.  He then sent on [troops] to Tablada and Hisn Al-kasr, [of which he gained possession],  and put himself in communication with the Almoravides on the opposite shore. His example  was speedily followed by other chieftains: Ibn Kasi rose at Silves; ’Alf Ibn ’Isa Ibn Maymiin  did the same at Cadiz; Mohammed Ibn ’Ali Ibnu-l-hajjém * at Badajoz. In short, the only  chief who, on this occasion, remained faithful to the Almohades, was Abi-l-ghamr Ibn  Ghariin, governor of Xerez, Ronda, and the neighbouring districts, which he continued to  hold for them and in their name, On the other hand, Ibn Ghéniyyah, the Almoravide, took  possession of Algesiras, whence he stirred the inhabitants of Ceuta to rebel, as before stated.®  Owing to these circumstances, the situation of the Almohades at Seville became so precarious,  that ’Isa and ’Abdu-l-’aziz, the two brothers of the Mahdi, with a cousin of theirs, named  Islitin, and such as followed their party, were compelled to leave that city, and retire to the  mountains of Bishter.'° Here they were joined by Abu-l-ghamr Ibn Gharin at the head of  his forces, when it was agreed among them to lay siege to Algesiras; which was done, until  that city was taken by storm, the Almoravides, who composed the garrison, being all put to  the sword. After this exploit, the brothers of the Mahdi crossed over’ to Morocco, and  *Abdu-l-mimen sent Yiisuf Ibn Suleyman to Seville with an army of Almohades. On his  arrival there, Yusuf took the command from the hands of the governor, Berréz Ibn Mo-  hammed, whom he allowed, however, to retain the office of tax-collector. He then went out  against Al-betrihi, whose states of Niebla and Tablada he speedily reduced. The same fate  befel Ibn Kasi, whose city, Silves, was taken from him. After these exploits, Yusuf [Ibn  SuleymAn] set out, though it was winter,"" against ""Isa Ibn Maymin, Lord of Santa Maria,  whom he compelled to return under the obedience of the Almohades, and to join him with              8 The author of the Karttds speaks of an individual named Abd ’Abdillah Ibnu-]-hajjam, who was appointed governor of  Badajoz in a... 501 by ’Alf Ibn Ydsuf, the second Sultén of the Almoravides. Jénu-l-hajjém means ‘the son of the  surgeon or barber,’ whence are derived the Spanish words alfayeme and alhageme, which have still a similar meaning.    ® This happened in a.H. 543; the K4di Iyédh, who was governor of the city, revolting against ’Abdu-l-mimen, and  proclaiming Ibn Ghéniyyah. 10 phy Us>—Between Malaga and Ronda.  1 Such I believe to be the meaning which the author intended to convey by these words: x spo use hu i? je} ra",633,,

After this he returned to Seville.   During these transactions the Christian king (Alfonso II. of Castile), having mustered all  his forces, marched against Yahya Ibn ’Ali Ibn Ghéniyyah, Lord of Cordova, whose friend  and ally he had been on a former occasion, but whom he now attacked. After ravaging the  territories subject to his rule, Alfonso appeared in sight of Cordova, and besieged Ibn  Ghéniyyah in his capital. In this manner the Christians made themselves masters of Lisbon,  Tortosa,'? Lerida, Fraga, Santa Maria, and other cities or fortresses belonging to the Moslems  of Andalus. In this conflict Ibn Ghéniyyah began to look about him for the means of  increasing the number of his warsiors, and expelling the insolent Christians from before the  walls of Cordova: to this end he sent a message to Berréz Ibn Mohammed, the general of  the Almohades, asking for an interview. The meeting having taken place at Ezija, Berréz  agreed to assist him with the troops under his command, on condition that he (Ibn Ghé-  niyyah) would immediately put him in possession of Cordova and Carmona, in compensation  for which he was to receive Jaen. Ibn Ghaniyyah having accepted of these terms, a treaty  was immediately drawn up between the two chiefs, and sent over to Africa for the con-  firmation of ’Abdu-l-mimen. When this arrived, Ibn Ghaniyyah gave up Cordova to Berraz,  and retired to Jaen. He.was there besieged by the Christian king; but Ibn Ghaniyyah  having treacherously seized on one of his counts,’ and confined him to the castle of Ibn  Sa’id (Alcal4 de Aben Zaid), the Christian king was compelled to give up his undertaking,  and retire from before Jaen. After this, Ibn Ghaniyyah repaired to Granada, which city was  in the hands of Maymtn Ibn Bedr Al-lamtiini, who commanded a body of Almoravides.  Ibn Ghéniyyah went thither for the purpose of inducing that chieftain to come to an agree-  ment with the Almohades, as he himself had done; but all his arguments were in vain, and  Maymin persevered in his rebellion. Shortly after, Ibn Ghaniyyah died at that city in the  month of Sha’bén of the year 543 (January, a.p. 1149): he was buried there, his tomb  being well known to this day.         2 The text reads For parle Tarsisah, which is evidently a mistake for 421 glob Tortésa, unless it be meant for & puso  Tarazéna, which can hardly be supposed. The cities mentioned in this passage were not reduced by Alfonso II., as here  intimated. Lisbon and Santa Maria (de Algarbe] were taken by Alfonso I. of Portugal, in 1147, or 542 of the Hijra, and  the other three by Raymond V., Count of Barcelona, in 1148-9.   18 This was Count Don Manrique de Lara, Ibn Ghéniyyah sent a messenger to Alfonso, inviting him to Jaen, of which  city he offered him the possession. Alfonso accepted the proposition, but did not go in person. He sent thither the above-  mentioned nobleman, at the head of a body of cavalry: on his arrival at Jaen, Don Manrique was made a prisoner, and  confined to a castle.   4 According to Ibn Sahibi-s-salat and the author of the Karffds, Ibn Ghaniyyah died a natural death on Friday, the 24th  of Sha’bin, 543 (Jan. 7, a.p. 1149), and “ was buried within the Kassdbah, and opposite to the tomb of Badis Ibn  Habis.” Conde, though professing to translate the narrative of the last-mentioned writer, makes Ibn Ghéniyyah die in a    - s  skirmish with the Almohades.

"    APPENDIX. liii    In the mean time the Christian king, thinking the opportunity a favourable one again to  attack Cordova, marched his army thither, and laid siege to it. When the intelligence  reached Seville, the Almohades immediately sent to its relief Abé-l-ghamr Ibn Gharin, who,  having made a junction with the troops of Yusuf Al-betrihi, governor of Niebla, proceeded  by forced marches to his destination. *Abdu-l-mtimen, who had likewise been informed of the  perilous situation of the Cordovans, had also sent thither an army of Almohades under the  command of Yahya Ibn Yaghmtr. This general, therefore, having joined on the way the  forces commanded by Abi-l-ghamr, entered Cordova without any opposition on the part of  the besieging army. A few days after this, the Christian king struck his tents, and dis-  appeared from before the city. From all parts of Andalus rebels came to Ibn Yaghmir to  ask him for letters of security in the name of ’Abdu-l-mtimen; which being obtained, they  repaired to Morocco, and presented themselves to that Sultan, who received them kindly,  and was pleased graciously to pardon all their offences. Subsequently to this, 7Abdu-l-mimen,  having removed to Salé in the year 545 (beginning April 29, a.p. 1150), invited the people  of Andalus ""5 to come over to him; which they did in great numbers, when they all proclaimed  him as their rightful sovereign; the rebel chieftains hastening also to take the oath of alle-  giance, and to lay down all [usurped] authority. Among the Andalusians who on this  occasion presented themselves to ’Abdu-l-mtimen was Seddaray Ibn Wazir, Lord of Beja  and Ebora; Al-betrihi, governor of Niebla; Ibn Gharén [Abi-l-ghamr], Lord of Xerez and  Ronda; Ibnu-l-hajjim, Lord of Badajoz; ’A’mil Ibn Muhib,' Lord of Talavera (Tavira ?).  Ibn Kasi and the people of Silves were the only Andalusians who did not make their  submission on this occasion, this being the cause of the death of that chieftain [who was  afterwards executed], as we shall relate in due course.'!7 ’Abdu-l-mtimen returned to Morocco,  and the Andalusians to their respective towns; he moreover took most of the rebel chieftains  with him to his capital, and kept them about his court. In the year 548 (beginning  March 28, a.p. 1153), ’Abdu-l-mtimen ordered the execution of Islitin, a relative of the  Mahdi.'*    The Almohades subdue the rest of Andalus.

He likewise deposed Abi Zeyd Ibn Bakit from the government  of Cordova, and appointed in his room ’Abdullah Ibn Suleyman. On his arrival at Seville,  the new governor put Yahya Ibn Yaghmir in irons, and took him with him to Algesiras: he  there assigned him his dwelling for a prison, until he dispatched him to Telemsan, escorted  by his son, Sid Abt Hafss.   In the mean while the empire of the Almohades waxed stronger in Andalus. Maymin Ibn  Bedr Al-lamtini quitted Granada, where the supremacy of the Almohades was immediately  acknowledged. Soon after, Sid Abi Sa’fd, governor of Ceuta, went over to assume the  command of that city in the name of his father, the Sultén ’Abdu-l-mtimen. The wearers of  the veil (Almoravides) [who were at Granada] were compelled to repair to Morocco. Sid  Abt Sa’id Al-merinf laid siege to Almeria, until he obliged the Christians within to surrender  on the terms of a capitulation drawn up by the Wizir Abi Ja’far Ibn ’Attiyyah. Notwith-  standing that the garrison of Almeria had received assistance from the rebel Ibn Mardanish,  who had risen [some time before] in the eastern parts of Andalus, and also from the Christian  king, his ally, all these forces united together were unable to deter that prince from his  purpose; and the city was taken, as before related, in 546 (beginning April 19, a.p. 1152).   In the year 551 (beginning Feb. 24, a.p. 1156), the Sheikhs of Seville, having come  {to Africa] to ask ’Abdu-l-mtimen to appoint one of his sons to command over them, that  Sultén gave the investiture of Seville and its dependencies to his son Sid Abi Ya’kub, who  immediately took possession of it. One of the first acts of his government was to make war  against Al-wahibi, the rebel. Having accordingly left Seville, he put himself at the head of  his army, and, accompanied by the Wizir Abu Ja’far Ibn *Attiyyah, started in pursuit of that  chieftain, whom he besieged [in one of his fortresses] until he compelled him to surrender.  After this, he took possession of the states of Ibn Wazir, and of those of Ibn Kasi, which  last were reduced by a division of his army under the command of Téshefin Al-lamtinf. The  victory, in short, was every where complete. After this success, Sid Abu Ya’kub returned to  Seville, and the Wizir Abu Ja’far to Morocco, where he soon after fell into disgrace, and  was put to death® by the command of ’Abdu-l-mtimen, who appointed ’Abdu-s-sellém  Al-kiimi to succeed him in the charge of Wizir. *Abdu-s-sellim, who was connected by  marriage with the family of ’Abdu-l-muimen, retained that office until he was executed by  order of that Sultan, soon after the taking of Telemsdn, as we shall hereafter relate.

For this purpose he went to Salé, but having whilst there received intelligence of fresh  troubles in Eastern Africa, and of the taking of Mehediyyah by the Christians, he gave up  his former determination, and turned his attention to that quarter. Accordingly, having  appointed the Sheikh Abi Hafss to command in the Maghreb during his absence, he  hastened to Eastern Africa at the head of all the forces collected round Salé for his intended  expedition to Andalus, and arrived before Mehediyyah, when he compelled the Christians  and Sicilians, who had taken possession of it, to capitulate in 555 (a.p. 1160).¥    Account of Ibn Mardanish, who revolted [against the Almohades] in the eastern provinces  of Andalus.    Whilst ’Abdu-l-mimen was in Eastern Africa, the intelligence was brought to him that  Mohammed Ibn Mardanish, who rose in the eastern provinces of Andalus, had gone out of  Murcia, and encamped before Jaen, the governor of which city, named Mohammed Ibn ’Ali  Al-ktimi, had submitted to him. He had likewise appeared in sight of Cordova; but unable  to gain possession of that city, he had raised the siege, and marched against Carmona, which  he had taken by treason. He had thence returned to Cordova, the governor of which, Ibn  Bakit, had sallied out against him, but had been defeated, and put to death. On the  arrival of this diastrous news, ’Abdu-l-mimen wrote to his lieutenants in Andalus, apprising  them of his recent conquests in Eastern Africa, and of his intention shortly to cross over to  Andalus in person. Accordingly, after making the necessary preparations, he crossed the  straits, and landed at Jebalu-l-futah (Gibraltar), where he was soon joined by the Almohades,  and such among the Andalusians [as followed his banners]. After providing for the affairs of  government, ’Abdu-l-miuimen returned to Morocco, whence he sent his army to make war  on the infidels of Andalus. The Christian king, having marched against the Moslems, was  defeated, and his army dispersed. Sid Abi Ya’kiib took Carmona from the hands of Ibn  Humushk, who commanded there by the appointment of Ibn Mardanish, his brother-in-law ;  but whilst Sid Abi Ya’kib, governor of Seville, and Sid Abi Sa’id, governor of Granada,  were at Morocco, whither they had crossed over for the purpose of visiting ’Abdu-l-muimen,  Ibn Humushk, seizing the opportunity, approached Granada secretly and at night, and  succeeded, with the aid of his numerous partisans there, in gaining possession of the city ;*         ® Historians are at variance as to the date of the taking of Mehediyyah by ’Abdu-l-mimen. Some, as Ibn Séhibi-s-salat,  (Bodl. Lib., Marsh, 433, fo. 7, verso,) place it in a. H. 554, after a siege of seven months; the anonymous writer of a history  of Morocco, (see vol. i. p. 349, Note 73,) on the 10th of Moharram of 555, after a siege of five months and nine days.

When this news was  known in Africa, the Sultén ’Abdu-l-mimen immediately left Morocco, to deliver his  followers. He arrived at Salé, and having appointed Sid Abi Sa’id to the command of  his army, this general immediately crossed the strait at the head of numerous forces. Being  joined on his landing by Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Abi Hafss Ibn ’Alf, lieutenant-governor of  Seville, he marched to Granada. On the news of their approach, Ibn Humushk sallied out  of the city, and defeated them: Sid Abii Sa’id retreated to Malaga, upon which ’Abdu-l-  miimen deprived him of the command of the army, and gave it to his brother, Sid Abi  Ya’ktib. The Almohades marched a second time against Granada, whither Ibn Mardanish  himself had lately arrived with his Christian auxiliaries to the succour of his brother-in-law,  Ibn Humushk. A battle was then fought in the plain of that city, in which the victory  remained to the former, Ibn Mardanish betaking himself to his strongholds in the eastern  provinces, whilst Ibn Humushk took refuge in Jaen, where he was immediately besieged by  the victorious Almohades. After this, Sid Abi Ya’kub and Sid Abii Sa’id went to Cordova,  where they remained until the year 558 (beginning Dec. 9, a.p. 1162), when the former was  summoned to Morocco by his father, who wished to designate him his successor to the  empire, instead of his brother Mohammed, and to have him acknowledged as such by the  councils of the Almohades and the governors of the provinces. In compliance with these  orders, Abi Ya’kib repaired to Morocco; and the ceremony being performed, he accom-  panied his father the Khalif ’Abdu-l-mtimen to Rebéat, whence that Sultén intended to set out  a second time for Andalus, for the purpose of prosecuting the holy war. He was, however,  overtaken by death, at Salé, in Juméda 11. of the same year 558 (May, a.p. 1163). His  remains were deposited at Tinmelel, beside those of the Mahdi.    Reign of the Khalif Yisuf, son of ’ Abdu-l-miimen.    Fo. 108, verso.—Immediately after the death of ’Abdu-l-mtimen, Sid Abi Hafss went to the  chiefs of the Almohades, and received from every one of them the striking of hands, or cus-  tomary oath of allegiance to his brother Abi Ya’kub [Yusuf]. Being greatly satisfied with this  [generous] conduct on the part of his own brother, Abi Ya’kub preferred him to his intimacy,  confirmed him in all his honours and distinctions, and appointed him his Wizir. This being  done, they returned together to Morocco. This Sid Abi Hafss had been Wizfr to his father,  ?Abdu-l-mumen, who, after the disgrace and execution of his chief Wizir, ’Abdu-s-sellim [Ibn  Mohammed] Al-kiimi, in 555 (beginning Jan. 11, a.p. 1160), had recalled him from Eastern  Africa, and appointed him to the vacant office. Abi Hafss filled the duties of the Wizirate  conjointly with Abi-l-’ola Ibn Jami’, who was appointed to assist him until ’Abdu-l-mimen  died, when, as before related, he received the oaths of the people for his brother Abii Ya’kub.         % He was arrested by order of ’Abdu-l-mimen shortly after the entrance of that Sultan into Telems&n, a.H. 555 (a.v.  1160). Two days after, he died in prison from the effects of poison, administered to him in a bowl of milk. See Karftds,  p. 217. See also Conde (vol. ii. p. 349), who, with his usual negligence, or rather from his not understanding the text of  the above writer, says that it was ’Abdu-s-sellam who poisoned Ibn 'Attiyyah, his predecessor in office.

"    APPENDIX. Wii    Soon after the death of ’Abdu-l-miimen, happened that of his son, Abi-l-hasan, governor of  Fez, and that of Sid Abi Mohammed, governor of Bujéyah (Bugia), on his way to the  capital (Morocco). In the year 560 (beginning Nov. 17, a.p. 1164), the Sultén (Abi  Ya’ktib) summoned to his presence Sid Abi Sa’id, who, in obedience to his orders, left  Granada [of which city he was governor], and arrived at Morocco. His brother, Sid Abii  Hafss, went to Ceuta to meet him on his first landing in Africa.   Subsequently to this, the Khalif Abii Ya’kiib, having received intelligence of the march of  Ibn Mardanish to Cordova, sent his brother, Abi Hafss, to Andalus with a powerful army  of Almohades, re-inforced by the Arabian tribes of Zaghabah, Riyah, and Ath-thij. Abu  Hafss crossed the straits, and marched against Ibn Mardanish, who, having collected all  his forces, and obtained succours from his friends and neighbours the Christians, prepared  for a stout resistance. The Almohades met him on the plain of Murcia, where the re-  bellious chieftain and his auxiliaries were completely defeated, and compelled to take refuge  within that city. He was there immediately besieged by the Almohades, who reduced the  neighbouring districts. After this splendid victory, through which the raging fire of civil  war was somewhat allayed, Sid Abu Hafss and his brother, Abi Sa’id, returned to Morocco  in the year 561 (beginning Nov. 6, a.p. 1165). In the same year (a.H. 561) the Khalif  gave his brother, Sid Abu Zakariyyé, the investiture of Bugia. He also gave that of Seville  to the Sheikh Abt ’Abdillah Ibn Abi Ibréhim, though he afterwards removed him to make  room for his own brother, Abi Ibréhim. He confirmed the Sheikh Abi ’Abdillah in his  office of Wizir [to the former], and gave the investiture of Cordova to Sid Abu Is’hék:  he also confirmed Sid Abii Sa’id in the government of Granada. After this, the Almohades,  having bethought them of adopting a motto* for the dispatches signed by their Khalifs,  chose the following,—Wa-l-hamdu lillahi wahduhu, ‘ Praise be [given] to God the only one,’  —which they chanced to find in the handwriting of the hném Al-mahdi, in one of his official  letters; and it continued to be their device to the end of their empire.    Civil war in [the mountains of] Gomdrah.    In the year 562 (beginning Oct. 27, a.p. 1166), the Amir Abi Ya’ktib moved towards the  mountains of Gomdrah (Gomera), where a rebel named Saba’ Ibn Mun’akéd* had risen,  calling upon the inhabitants to join their neighbours the Senhdjah in their rebellion against  the Almohades. At first, the Amir Abii Ya’kiib sent an army under the command of the  Sheikh Abi Hafss; but these forces being insufficient to quell the rebellion of the tribes of  Gomérah and Senhdjah united together, he repaired to the field of war in person, defeated the  rebels in several encounters, and almost exterminated them; he also put to death Saba’ Ibn  Mun’akad, by which he applied a cautery to that evil. He then gave to his brother, Sid Abu         * The word I have translated by ‘motto’ is Xe which means ‘a sign, a mark, a signature, the reading upon a  seal,’ &c.  % Mate wu whom Ibn Séhibi-s-salét calls Jlaat< wl Ibn Munhaffd, and the author of the Karffds  OBale Qj!

In the year 563 (beginning Oct. 16, a.p. 1167), the Almohades renewed the oath of alle-  giance*” to Abi Ya’kib, on whom they agreed to confer the title of Amfru-I-mimenin  (commander of the faithful). The Sultaén then wrote to the Arabs of Eastern Africa, stirring  them up to resume the war against the infidels. For this purpose he addressed to them a  kasstdah and an epistle, which are sufficiently known among [literary] men. The answer  made by the Arabs, and their readiness to flock under his banners, are also too well known  [to deserve being recorded here].    Events in Andalus.    When Abt Ya’kiib saw his empire consolidated in Africa, he began to turn his eyes  towards Andalus, and to meditate the prosecution of the holy war. The intelligence having  been brought to him that the enemy (may the curse of God fall on his head!) had surprised  the city of Truxillo, then that of Ebora, then the fortresses of Sheberinah and Jelmaniyyah,*  opposite to Badajoz, and lastly, the city of Badajoz itself, he dispatched against him the  Sheikh Abi Hafss, with an army of Almohades. Having made the necessary preparations,  Abi Hafss crossed over to Andalus in the year 564 (beginning Oct. 4, a. p. 1168), to deliver  Badajoz from the horrors of a siege. Scarcely, however, had he arrived at Seville, and  was preparing for his expedition, when news came to him how the Almohades of Badajoz  had, with the assistance of the son of Alfonso (Ferdinand), defeated and taken prisoner  the son of Errink (Alfonso Enriquez), who commanded the besieging forces, and how his  enemy, the King of Galicia, had also fled to his castles. The Sheikh Abi Hafss then  marched to Cordova, whence he dispatched an army to the assistance of the people of  Badajoz, under the command of Ibréhim Ibn Humushk. This chief had some time pre-  viously tendered his obedience [to the Almohades], and made profession of the unity of  God, owing to certain differences’ which had arisen between him and his friend Ibn Marda-  nish, and which had created much ill-will and animosity between them. Ibn Mardanish  having begun hostilities, Ibn Humushk had retorted, and, in order the better to repel  his attacks, had sent to offer the Sheikh Abii Hafss his submission, on condition that he  would assist him against his enemy. The Sheikh hastened to inform the Khalif of the  circumstance, as well as of the incursions and ravages which the Christians were daily  making in the Moslem territory. Upon which, Abi Ya’kib sent his own brother and         7 Two kinds of inauguration were then in use among the Almohades: the Kola! or ‘ private,’ that is, of the high  officers of the state, of the members of the royal family, &c.; and Rela!) or de Lal! that of the subjects: and, according to  the author of the Kartfds, Yasuf went at first only through the former of these ceremonies.   3 Kile Jelmania, perhaps « corruption of Germania.

"    APPENDIX. lix    Wizir, Sid Abi Hafss,® at the head of an army of Almohades. Abi Hafss started from  Morocco in the year 565 (beginning Sept. 24, a. p. 1169), taking in his company his brother  Sid Abt Sa’id, whom, immediately after his arrival in Seville, he sent on to Badajoz. Abi  Sa’id, having concluded a peace with the Christian king, returned to Seville. The two  brothers then marched upon Murcia, the capital of the states of Ibn Mardanish, which  they invested, taking with them Ibn Humushk, the former friend of that rebel. During  the siege of Murcia the people of Lorca, another city subject to Ibn Mardanish, shook  off his yoke, and proclaimed the supremacy of the Almohades. After taking possession  of Lorca, Sid Abii Hafss stormed the city of Bastah (Baza), the taking of which was  soon followed by the surrender of Almeria, whose governor, named Mohammed,” a nephew  of Ibn Mardanish, bought by ready submission the pardon of his rebellion.   When the news of this success reached Morocco, there happened to be encamped near  that capital considerable forces of the Arabs of Eastern Africa, which had been brought  thither by Sid Abi Zakariyy4, governor of Bujéyah (Bugia), and Sid Abi *Imrén, governor  of Tremezen. The day of their arrival had been one of great festivity and rejoicing: profiting  by the assembly of such considerable forces, the Khalif determined to employ them against  the infidels. Having, therefore, reviewed them, as well as his own troops, he started for  Andalus, after appointing his brother Sid Abi ’Imrén to command at Morocco in his  absence. He arrived in Cordova in the year 567 (beginning Sept. 3, a.p. 1171): after  some stay he left that city and repaired to Seville, where he was met by Sid Abi Hafss  on his return from the expedition against Ibn Mardanish. This rebel, seeing the siege  protracted, and having no hopes of succour, had made a sally, and, breaking a passage  through the ranks of the besieged, whom he found unprepared, had effected his escape.  However, his brother Abu-l-hejéj, and his son Heldl, had tendered their obedience to  the Almohades; and he himself (Ibn Mardanish) had died soon after in Rejeb of the same  year®! (March, a.p. 1172). After the death of his father, Helal sent to offer the Almohades  possession of Murcia; upon which, Abi Hafss hastened to that city. Helal went out with  a party to meet him; and Abu Hafss, having received him with every kindness, sent him  on to the Khalif, who was at that time in Seville. After this, the Khalif Abi Ya’kub went  out of Seville, intent upon an incursion into the enemy’s country. He laid siege to Ubeda,         ® This Sid Abd Hafss, who was ’Abdu-l-mamen’s brother, must not be confounded with the Sheikh Aba Hafss, who was  no relation of that Sultan, and whose descendants, the Hafssides or Beni Abi Hafss, became in time kings of Eastern Africa.    ® bn Séhibi-s-salat (loco laud.) gives some interesting details about this chieftain. His name was Mohammed; but he    was more gencrally known under the surname of Ibn Sahib Al-basit, emi! Wele wv (‘the son of the hero of    Albacete,’) a surname given to his father, ""Abdullah Ibn Mardanfsh, after his victory over Ibn Hiid, in the neighbourhood of  that town. Ilis uncle, Mohammed Ibn Mardanish, had intrusted him with the government of Almeria, and given him  besides his own daughter in marriage ; but when he heard of his submission to the Almohades, the rage of that rebel, who  was then at Valencia, was so great, that he ordered the immediate execution of the wife (his own daughter) and all the children  of his cousin. The wife, however, was spared ; though the children were drowned in the Albuhera, a lake close to Valencia.    % Conde (vol. ii. p. 380) gives three different dates for the death of this chieftain, 567-9-71 ; but the former is the most  probable, as agreeing with the account of the Karftds, Ibn Sahibi-s-salat, and Abi-l-feda.",641,,
"    lx APPENDIX.    and remained some days encamped before the city; he then raised his tents, and marched  to Murcia, whence he returned to Seville in the year 568 (beginning August 22, a.p. 1172),  taking with him Helél Ibn [Mohammed Ibn Sa’d Ibn] Mardanish, whom he had so far  distinguished as to take his sister for a wife? Abi Ya’kiib gave to his own uncle, Yusuf,  the government of Valencia, and to his brother, Sid Abt Sa’id, the investiture of Granada.  After this, having received intelligence of an incursion which the enemy, commanded by  Count Al-ahdab,® had made into the country of the Moslems, the Khalif went out to meet  them at the head of his forces. Having overtaken them near Kal’ah Rabéh (Calatrava), he  defeated them with great loss; after which he returned victorious to Seville. Having arrived  there, and wishing to provide for the defence of that frontier, he gave orders for the rebuilding  of the fortress of Al-kal’ah (Alcalé de Guadayra), which had been in ruins since the time of the  civil wars between Ibnu-l-hej4j and Koreyb Ibn Khaldiin,™ during the reigns of Al-mundhir  Ibn Mohammed and his brother ’Abdullah, both Sultans of the family of Umeyyah. After  this, the son of Alfonso bestirred himself, and made an incursion into the Moslem territory.  The Khalif collected his forces, and dispatched against him an army under the orders of Sid  Abt Hafss, who not only repelled the invasion, but attacked the enemy of God in the  very heart of his dominions, took from him Kantarah As-seyf (Alcantara), and defeated his  armies wherever they attempted to make a stand. In the year 571 (beginning July 21,  A.D. 1175), five years after his crossing to Andalus, the Khalif started from Seville on his  way back to Morocco. Before taking his departure, however, he gave his brother Al-hasan  the investiture of Cordova; and his brother ’Ali that of Seville. Soon after this, the plague  having broken out at Morocco, three members of the Sultén’s family were attacked, and died  of it. These were Sid Abi ’Imrén, Sid Abii Sa’id, and Sid Abii Zakariyy&. The Sheikh  Abii Hafss also died of it, as he was journeying from Cordova [to Morocco], and was interred  at Salé. After this, the Khalif having summoned to his presence his own brothers, Abti Alf  and Abi-l-hasan, they came over from Andalus, and appeared at court: he then gave to  the former the investiture of Sijilmésah, and caused the latter, *Abu-l-hasan, to return to  Cordova. He also granted investitures to his two nephews, the sons of his brother Sid  Abii Hafss; to Abii Zeyd he gave the government of Granada, and that of Malaga to Abi  Mohammed ’Abdullah. In the year 573 (beginning June 29, a.p. 1177), the Khalif being  displeased with his Wizirs, the Beni Jami’, exiled them to Merida. In the year 575  (beginning June 7, a.p. 1179), he gave to Ghénim Ibn Mohammed Ibn Mardanish the  command of his fleets, and directed him to attack Lisbon; which he did, returning with  considerable spoil.

Abt Hafss’ two sons  having come over from Andalus, and informed the Khalif of the annoyance to which the  Moslems of that country were exposed through the incessant attacks of the Christian king,  he determined to re-commence the holy war, for which end he began to summon the Arabian  tribes from Eastern Africa.    Abii Yo kit’s assiduity in the prosecution of the holy war.    On his return from the expedition to Kafssah, which city was taken in the year 577  (beginning May 16, a.p. 1181), Abi Ya’ktib received the congratulations of his brother Sid  Abd ’Abdi-r-rahman Ya’ktib, who came over from Murcia, as well as those of all the Almo-  hades and the chiefs of Andalus who hastened to his presence [for that purpose]. Abi  Ya’ktib welcomed their arrival, and they all returned to their respective countries honoured  and satisfied. The intelligence then came to him that Mohammed Ibn Yiisuf Ibn WAntidin,  with the Almohades of Seville, had made a foray into the enemy’s territory, had laid siege to  the city of Ebora, plundered the neighbouring districts, reduced some of its fortresses, and  then returned victorious to Seville. He also heard that ""Abdullah Ibn Is’hék Ibn Jémi’, the  commander of the fleets of that city, had met at sea the naval forces of Lisbon, which he  had defeated, sinking or capturing twenty of their ships, taking at the same time con-  siderable spoil, and making numbers of prisoners. Subsequently to this, the news came to  him how Alfonso, son of Sancho, had laid siege to Cordova, and made several incursions in  the neighbourhood of Malaga, Ronda, and Granada; after which he had appeared in sight of  Ezija, and stormed the castle of Shankilah,** wherein he had left a garrison of Christians, and  then returned to his own dominions; that upon this Abii Is’hék had mustered all his forces,  and repaired to the subdued fortress (Shankilah), which he had besieged [though in vain] for  about forty days; for when King Alfonso heard of it, he sallied out of Toledo to the succour  of the besieged, and Abu Is’hék was compelled to desist from his undertaking. During the  course of these events, Ibn W4ntidin (Mohammed Ibn Yusuf) had gone out of Seville with  an army of Almohades, and laid siege to Talavera: the garrison having made a sally, he  defeated them completely, and returned [to Seville] loaded with spoil. The news of these  occurrences, which came to Abii Ya’kib in rapid succession, induced that Khalif earnestly to  prosecute the holy war. To this end, he appointed his two sons, Sid Abt Is’hék and Sid Abu  Yahya, to the command of his forces in Andalus: he confirmed the former in the government  of Seville, and gave to the latter the investiture of Cordova: he also gave that of Granada to  his son Sid Abt Zeyd Al-hirssani; and that of Murcia to Sid Abi ’Abdillah. He himself pre-  pared to cross over to Andalus; for which purpose he arrived at Salé in the year 577 (beginning  May 16, A.D. 1181), and was met there by Abii Mohammed Ibn Abi Is’hék Ibn Jémi’  at the head of the Arabian tribes of Eastern Africa. Thence the Sultén went to Fez, and  after sending in advance the tribes of Hentétah and Tinmelel, and the forces of the Arabs,  he himself crossed the sea from Ceuta in Safar of the year 578 (June, a.p. 1182), He  landed at Jebalu-l-fatah (Gibraltar), and thence proceeded to Seville, where he was met         3 EAGLE perhaps Sieteflla Xais",643,,

He then marched towards  Shatareyn (Santarem), which he besieged; but after some days he gave orders for raising the  siege, and the men were disheartened and discontented. The Christians of the town, having  made a sally, found the Khalif almost alone, and unprepared for the attack; the consequence  was, that the Khalif and those who were with him were sadly tried in the cause of God, and  turned their backs after a most sanguinary conflict. On that very day® the Khalif died;  some say, of an arrow-shot which he received in the midst of the fight; others, of a disease  which attacked him on the road. (May God have forgiven him !).    Reign of his son, Ya’kib Al-mansir.    After the death of the Khalif [Abi Ya’kib Yusuf] before Santarem, above related, his  son Ya’kib [Abi Yusuf] was immediately proclaimed. He returned with the army to  Seville, where he received the oaths of the inhabitants. He then appointed the Sheikh Abi  Mohammed ’Abdu-l-wéhed Ibn Abi Hafss to the post of Wizir, and intrusted to his  brother, Sid Abii Yahya, the prosecution of the war against the infidels. Abi Yahya reduced  some fortresses, and committed all manner of depredations in the enemy’s country. After  this he (Ya’kub) crossed the sea to the capital of his African dominions (Morocco). On his  way thither he was met at Kasr-Masmidah by Sid Abu Zakariyyé, son of Sid Abi Hafss,  who had come from Telemsan with the Sheikhs of the tribe of Zaghabah. He then proceeded  to Morocco, where he suppressed iniquity, administered justice with an even hand, and  promulgated laws. One of the first occurrences of his reign was the rebellion of Ibn  Ghéniyyah, which we are going to relate.    Account of the origin and rising of Ibn Ghaniyyah.    We have elsewhere related how the enemy of God took possession of Mallorca, and how  the inhabitants of that island were left without a ruler by the death of their governor,  Mubashsher, who had formerly been a freed-slave of Mujahid. Whilst the Christians were  besieging his capital, this chief had sent to implore the assistance of ’Ali Ibn Yusuf; but  before the re-inforcements which that Sultén sent had arrived, the island was taken and  plundered, and the city burnt down by the Christians, who set sail for their country, loaded  with immense spoil. Yusuf appointed one of the bravest officers among the Lamtiinah, named  Wathur Ibn Abi Bekr, to be governor of the island, and gave him the command of a division  of five hundred cavalry. The new governor rendered himself exceedingly obnoxious to the  inhabitants: he subjected them to several vexations; among other things he ordered them  entirely to desert their city, and build another inland. This, however, was openly resisted  by the inhabitants; and a tumult ensuing, the leader of the discontented was seized and         % On Saturday, the 12th of Rabi’-l-akhar, 580, according to the author of the Karttds, who relates this differently, and  says that Abi Ya’kab defended himself valiantly, and killed six of his assailants with his own hands, but was at last pierced  by the spear of a Christian knight.

They then sent an embassy to ’Ali  Ibn Yusuf, who, having heard their case, granted them pardon, and appointed Mohammed  Ibn Ghéniyyah to succeed WAthir in the government of the island. This Mohammed was  the son of ’Alf Ibn Yahya Al-masiifi, better known under the surname of Ibn Ghaniyyah.  His brother Yahya [Ibn ’Alf] was then commanding the western provinces of Andalus  in the Khalif’s name; and, as he held his court at Seville, his brother had appointed him  his lieutenant in Cordova. The two brothers were filling their respective governments when  ’Ali Ibn Yusuf sent letters to Yahya, commanding him to remove his brother to the govern-  ment of Mallorca. In compliance with the Sultén’s orders, Mohammed sailed for that island,  taking with him his sons Abdullah, ’Ali, Ish&k, Az-zobeyr, Ibréhim, and Talhah. The two  first named had been under the special care of their uncle Yahya, who doted upon them, and  was a second father to them.   Immediately after his arrival on the island, Mohammed Ibn ’Ali Ibn Ghaniyyah seized  Wathir, whom he sent in irons to Morocco. After he had ruled for ten years*” over the  island, his brother Yahya Ibn Ghéniyyah died. He had freviously appointed his nephews,  ?Abdullah and Is’hék, to be governors of Granada and Carmona. After this happened the  death of ’Ali Ibn Ytisuf, and the decay of the empire of the Beni Lamtinah commenced,  which began every where to give way under the blows of the victorious Almohades. Seeing  this, Mohammed sent [to Andalus] for his two sons, Abdullah and Is’hék, who repaired to  Mallorca in their father’s fleet. The empire of the Lamtinah was finally subverted: sub-  sequently to this, Mohammed, having designated his son ’Abdullah to be the heir of his  dominions, Is‘hak, the other brother, took offence at it, and, having entered into a conspiracy  with some of the Lamtiinah, put his brother Abdullah, as well as his own father Mohammed,  to death. This done, the conspirators tried to rid themselves of Is’hék himself; but he  anticipated them, and through the means of Lob Ibn Maymin, general of the sea, who  embraced his cause, he was enabled to attack them in their dwellings, and put them to death;  thereby gaining complete possession of the island in the year 546 (beginning April 19,  A.D. 1151). At first, Ishék governed with great wisdom and moderation: he took to  planting and building; but after this he rather changed, and the inhabitants became disgusted  with his rule. Lob Ibn Maymiin then deserted his cause, and went over to his enemies  the Almohades. Is’hék in the mean while made war on the infidels. He was in the habit of  presenting the Khalif Abi Ya’kub with Christian slaves: he persevered in this custom until  he died, shortly before that monarch, in the year 580 (beginning April 13, a.p, 1184),  leaving thirteen sons: Mohammed, ’Alf, Yahya, ’Abdullah, Al-ghézi, Seyr, Al-mansir, Jab-  bérah, Téshefin, Talhah, Omar, Yiisuf, and Al-hasan.   Is‘hék was succeeded by his son Mohammed, who, soon after his accession, dispatched an  embassy to the Khalif Yusuf [Abu Ya’kub], offering to place himself under his government.  The Khalif sent him ’Alf Ibn Ar-robertin to receive his allegiance. No sooner, however,         % If the appointment of Mohammed Ibn Ghfniyyah to the government of Mallorca took place, as Ibnu Khaldin himself  and the author of the Xarttds state, in the year 520, twenty-three years must have elapsed between his taking possession of  the government and the death of his brother Yahya, which happened in Sha’bén, 543. See above.",645,,

About this time  news came to Mallorca of the death of the Khalif, and the appointment of his son Al-manstr,  who succeeded him in the empire. Encouraged by this, ’Alf confined Ibn Ar-robertin to a  dungeon, and after appointing his brother Talhah to command in Mallorca during his  absence, sailed with a fleet to Bujéyah (Bugia), of which city he gained possession in the  year 581 (beginning April 3, a.p. 1185), making the governor, Sid Abu-r-rabi’ah, and Sid  Abt Misa ’Imran, son of *Abdu-l-mumen, who chanced to be there at the time, his prisoners.  * * * * * * * * * * *   We have related elsewhere how Yahya Ibn Ghaniyyah, before leaving Mallorca for his  African expedition, had confined Ibn Ar-robertin to a dungeon, and appointed his brother  Talhah to govern the island in his absence. No sooner, however, did Ibn Ar-robertin, who  was an enterprising and shrewd man, see the ground clear from his enemies, than he meditated  a revolt, and, having entered into a secret negotiation with the Christian freedmen who  guarded his prison, promised to let them go to their native countries with their children and  families if they would assist him in his escape. They acceded to his wishes, and having risen  within the Kassdbah, they released Mohammed Ibn Is’hék from prison, and all repaired to  court. However, when the news of this occurrence reached Tripoli, where ’Ali Ibn  Ghéniyyah was at the time, he immediately sent his brother ""Abdullah to Sicily, who [having  there obtained some re-inforcements] sailed to Mallorca, and landed at a port on the island,  whence he gained possession of the capital by stratagem.    His adventures in the holy war.    In the year 586 (beginning Feb. 7, a.p. 1190), the Khalif Ya’kuib having learned through  a messenger sent him by Abii Yusuf Ibn Abi Hafss, governor of Seville, that the Christians  had taken the important city of Shelb (Silves),** and defeated the Almohades close to the  former city, into the neighbourhood of which they were making continual excursions,  reducing many of its fortresses, he summoned his men to the jihdd or holy war, and started  immediately for Andalus. He arrived at Kasr-Masmudah, where he made some stay; thence  he crossed over to Tarif (Tarifa), whence he proceeded by forced marches to Silves. He was  soon joined before that city by the forces of Andalus, to whom he intrusted the siege of the  city, whilst he himself marched to Hisn-Torash, which he reduced, returning afterwards  to Seville. In the year 587 (beginning Jan. 28, a.p. 1191), the Khalif returned to Silves,  putting himself at the head of the army before that place, which he took: he was there met  by Ibn Wazir, who arrived before Silves, after taking another fortress on his way to the  camp.

"    APPENDIX. lxv    returned to the capital of his African dominions, where he soon after appointed his son,  An-nésir, heir to his empire. In the year 588 (beginning Jan. 17, a. p. 1192), Sid Abi  Zeyd, governor of Eastern Africa, arrived at the court, bringing in his company the chiefs of  the Arabian tribes of Helél and Solaym. The Khalif received them with cordiality and  attention ; after which the messengers returned to their respective countries. In the year 590  (beginning Dec. 26, a.p. 1193), the intelligence being brought to Ya’kib how the power  of the rebel Ibn Ghéniyyah had greatly increased in Eastern Africa,—where he was com-  mitting all manner of ravages and depredations,—he decided to proceed to the seat of war.  Scarcely, however, had he reached Meknésah, when the news he received of the state of  affairs in Andalus made him change his determination and return to the West, in order to  march thither in person. He accordingly arrived in Cordova in the year 591 (beginning  Dec. 15, a.p. 1194). After staying in that city for three [days], that he might collect  together the troops he had summoned from every province of Andalus, Ya’kub started in  pursuit of the enemy, and arrived at Al-ark (Alarcos) in the district of Badajoz, where he  pitched his camp. He was here met by the whole of the Christian forces, commanded by  three of their princes, namely, Ibn Adefonsh (Alfonso III. of Castile), Ibn Errink (Sancho I.  of Portugal), and Ibnu-l-babij“ (Alfonso IX. of Leon). The battle was fought in the year  591 (beginning Dec. 15, a.p. 1194). Abi Mohammed Ibn Abi Hafss commanded the  volunteers; his brother, Abi Yahya, had charge of the Almohades and the rest of the troops.  This battle became ever after celebrated for the complete defeat of the Christians, of whose  number no less than thirty thousand perished by the swords of the Moslems. The relics of  the [Castilian] army, in all about five thousand men, principally officers and knights, took  refuge in the neighbouring castle of Alarcos; but Al-mansir followed them thither, compelled  them to surrender, made them all prisoners of war, and caused them afterwards to be  exchanged for a similar number of Moslem captives. On this memorable day, Abi Yahya,  son of the Sheikh Abi Hafss, died a martyr for the faith, after performing great feats of arms ;  whence his sons were ever after known under the surname of Beni-sh-shoheyd (the sons of  the martyr).   After this victory Al-mansir repaired to Seville, which city he again left in the year 592  (beginning Dec. 5, a.p. 1195), to make an incursion into the country of Al-jauf, where he    # The text reads il ra “he stopped or rested for three,’ which cannot be understood otherwise than by ‘days,’    from the fact of Ya’kib having landed at Algesiras on the 19th Rejeb, 591 (28th June, a.p. 1195), and his having  arrived at Alarcos on Thursday, the 3rd of Sha’ban of the same year (12th July, a.p. 1195), as asserted by Ibn Séhibi-  s-salét; thus making the interval between his landing and his appearing in sight of the enemy, thirteen days.    “ The Ms. reads ra hull —but ra pl is meant.

According to the Christian authorities, Alfonso  solicited the aid of his neighbours, Sancho VI. of Navarre, and Alfonso, of Leon; but though they proffered their assistance,  and marched to join him, he fought the battle without waiting for their arrival.

He also went forward to Toledo, round which capital he hovered, destroying the  crops, burning the villages and towns, carrying off the inhabitants, and laying waste: every  thing on his passage. After this he returned to Seville in the year 593 (beginning Nov. 23,  A.D. 1196). Whilst the Sultén was residing there, the Kadi Abi-l-walid Ibn Roshd was  charged with entertaining opinions contrary to the Mohammedan faith. His house being  searched by the Sultén’s orders, there were found papers in his own handwriting which  proved the charge, and he was accordingly cast into prison, though he was afterwards  released, and accompanied Al-mansiir to Morocco, where he died. Again Al-mansir left  Seville to make an incursion into the dominions of Ibn Adefonsh (Alfonso III. of Castile).  This time he penetrated as far-as Toledo, in the neighbourhood of which he encamped; but,  having received intelligence that the Lord of Barcelona (Pedro II. of Aragon?) had come to  the assistance of Alfonso, and that both were besieging Majoritt (Madrid), he raised the  siege, and hastened thither. Scarcely, however, had he appeared in sight of that town, when  the troops of Alfonso took to flight without waiting his approach; after which Al-mansir  returned to Seville, where he was met by the ambassadors of the Christian kings, who came  to ask for peace, which he granted. Having then given the investiture of Seville to Sid Abi  Zeyd Ibnu-l-khalffah; that of Badajoz to Sid Abi-r-rabi’, son of Sid Abi Hafss; that of  Al-gharb (the western provinces) to Sid Abu ’Abdillah, son of Sid Abu Hafss; the Sultén  crossed over to the capital of his African dominions in 594 (beginning Nov. 12, a.p. 1197).  He was soon after attacked by a disease which brought on his death. After drawing up  that memorable will [containing instructions to his son and heir] which has been handed  down to posterity, and which was witnessed by ’Isa, son of the Sheikh Abi Hafss, the  Khalif Ya’kib died (may God show him mercy!) in Rabi’ 11. of the year 595 (Feb.  A.D. 1199).    Reign of An-ndsir, son of Al-mansir.    On the death of Al-mansir, his son Mohammed, whom, as above stated, he had designated  for his heir, succeeded him. On his accession to power he assumed the surname of An-ndsir  lidini-llah (the defender of the religion of God). He named to the post of Wizir Abi Zeyd  Ibn Tiijén,“ a nephew of the Sheikh Abi Hafss, and after him Abii Mohammed, son of the  Sheikh Abi Hafss.         © See vol. i.

"    APPENDIX. Ixvii    Conquest of Mallorca.    The conquest of Mallorca happened thus. When ’Ali [Ibn Is‘hék Ibn Ghéniyyah] and his  brother Yahya, as has been related, sailed for Eastern Africa, after appointing their brother  Talhah to govern the island, another brother of theirs, named Mohammed Ibn Is‘haék [who was  confined in a dungeon], succeeded, in conjunction with Ibn Ar-robertin, in bribing his guards,  and was released by them from prison. This done, Mohammed decided on acknowledging  the supremacy of the Almohades. Having, therefore, proclaimed the Khalif Al-mansir,  he dispatched Ibn Ar-robertin to Africa, to inform that Sultan of the rising in his favour.  Immediately on the receipt of this intelligence, Al-manstir sent a fleet under the command of  Abi-l’ola Ibn Jami’ to take possession of the island in his name; but to this Mohammed  would not consent, and sent to ask the Lord of Barcelona for some troops to oppose the  landing of the Almohades. The Christian granted his request; but the people of Mallorca,  dreading the vengeance of Al-mansiir, rose against their king, Mohammed, and deposed him,  appointing in his room his brother Téshefin. When the news of this insurrection reached  Alf, who was then residing at Kosantinah, he immediately dispatched to Mallorca his two  brothers, ’Abdullah and Al-ghézi, who, having gained over to their party some of the  inhabitants, deposed Tashefin, and appointed Abdullah in his stead. Al-mansir, in the  mean time, made repeated attempts to gain possession of the island: he several times sent  his fleet, first under Abu-l-’ola Ibn Jémi’? above mentioned, then under Yahya, son of the  Sheikh Ibréhim Al-hazraji; but all was in vain, for the people of the island stoutly repulsed  the attacks, and killed great numbers of their assailants, whence the power of Ibn Ghaniyyah  [Abdullah Ibn Is‘hék] waxed stronger. These events happened within the year 583  (beginning March 12, a.p. 1187). However, on the death of Al-mansir, his son and  successor, An-ndsir, sent a fleet under the command of his uncle, Sid Abi-l-’ola, and of  the Sheikh Abi Sa’id Ibn Abi Hafss, who appeared in sight of the island, and besieged  ’Abdullah in his capital. This time the Almohades were victorious, owing to the defection  of Tashefin, ’Abdullah’s brother, who went over to them with the troops under his command ;  upon which the Almohades took the city by storm, and put to death [Abdullah and] most  of the inhabitants. Sid Abu-l-ola then returned to Morocco, after appointing ’Abdullah  Ibn Té’-allah Al-ktimi to be governor of the island. Some time after this, An-ndsir deposed  ?Abdullah, and named in his stead his own uncle, Sid Abi Zeyd [Ibn Tijin], who gave  ’Abdullah Ibn Mutd’i“® the command of the sea; after him, Sid Abu ’Abdillah Ibn Abi  Hafss Ibn ’Abdi-l-miimen; after him, Abi Yahya Ibn ’Ali Ibn Abi *Imran At-tinmeleli,  under whose government the island fell into the hands of the Christians in the year 627  (beginning Nov. 19, a. p. 1229).         \2 smu! i. e. from the tribe of Hazraj, a branch of the Masmudah.    # No doubt, the same individual above alluded to; but why should he be called there Ibn 74-'allah, and here Ibn Mufd’i 7?

"    Ixvili APPENDIX.    An-nisir’s high deeds in the prosecution of the holy war.    When An-ndsir received the intelligence that the fortresses round Valencia had fallen into  the hands of the Christians, he was greatly grieved and perplexed. He wrote to the Sheikh  Abi Mohammed Ibn Abi’ Hafss, asking his advice and assistance on this emergency; but he  refused to comply with his requests. He then left Morocco in the year 609 (beginning  June 2, a. D. 1212), and arrived at Seville, where he spent some time in making preparations  for the campaign he meditated. This done, he left that city at the head of his forces,  and invaded the dominions of Ibn Adefonsh (Alfonso III. of Castile), from whom he took  the castle of Shalbaterra (Salvatierra). Thence he proceeded by forced marches to attack  the infidel. The Christian king, in the mean time, had laid siege to Kal’ah Rabéh (Calatrava),  . and compelled its governor, Yusuf Ibn Kédis, to surrender. On the approach of An-nésir  the Christians went out to meet him. The Almohades marched in good order until they  came to a place called Al~akab, where the Christian king, having just been re-inforced  by the Lord of Barcelona (Pedro), who had come to his assistance, was strongly entrenched.  The two armies joined battle, but, alas! the wheel of fortune turned against the Moslems,  who were put to flight with dreadful slaughter. This disastrous battle was fought at the  end of Safar of 609 (July, a.p. 1212). After this, An-ndsir returned to Morocco, where  he died, in Sha’ban of the ensuing year. They say that Alfonso had entered into a secret  compact with his cousin, the son of Al-babij, King of Leon,“ that he should affect to  be the friend of An-ndsir, and then take to flight; which the Christian did, as agreed  between the two. After this they [the Almohades] returned to Andalus to oppose the  frequent incursions which the Christians were making in their territory. Having, upon  one occasion, arrived in sight of Seville, the Christians were met by Sid Abi Zakariyy4  Ibn Abi Hafss Ibn ’Abdi-l-mtimen, who defeated them with great slaughter; by which  victory the Moslems were somewhat revived.

Having, on one  occasion, uttered certain expressions which made him fear the vengeance of that Sultén,  he retired from the audience-room and hid himself for some time.

"    Ixx APPENDIX.    gained him over, they governed in, his name: owing to this circumstance, and also to the  extreme youth of Al-mustanser, Abi Mohammed, son of the Sheikh Abii Hafss, who was  then governor of Eastern Africa, was at first rather slow in sending in his allegiance; but  when Al-mustanser had removed his chief Wizir, Ibn Jémi’, as well as his Sdhibu-l-ashghdl,  *Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Abi Zeyd, Abi Mohammed failed not to send his homage to court.   After this, Al-mustanser began to attend to the affairs of government as assiduously as  his extreme youth would permit: he distributed the government of the several provinces  of his empire among the princes of the royal family: he gave the investiture of Fez to  {his uncle] Sid Abi Ibrahim, brother of Almansiir, who took [on the occasion] the surname  of Adh-dhdher, and was the father of Al-murtadhi [who reigned afterwards]. To his uncle  Sid Abid Is’hak Al-ahwal he gave the investiture of Seville. During this governor’s rule  the raging fire of war preyed on the fortresses which the Almohades had taken [from the  Christians], and the brave defenders of Andalus were defeated and dispersed.   On the death of Ibn Abi Zeyd, at the instigation of Abi Zeyd Ibn Tijin, Al-mustanser  deposed Ibn Jémi’ from the Wizirate, and appointed in his room Abii Yahya Al-hazraji. He  also named to the office of Sdhibu-l-ashghdl, Abi ’Ala Ibn Asharfi. He then restored Ibn  Jémi’ to his favour, and re-instated him in the office of Wizir. He also deprived Abi  Zeyd Ibn Tiijén of the government of Telemsén, which he gave to Sa’id Ibn Al-manstr, and  sent the former to Murcia, where he was imprisoned by his orders, and kept in close  confinement. The reign of Al-mustanser passed on in tranquillity and peace until the Beni  Merin made their appearance in the neighbourhood of Fez in the year 613 (beginning  April 19, a.p. 1216). Having sent against them [his uncle] Sid Abu Ibréhim, with the  forces of the Almohades, this general was defeated and taken prisoner; though no sooner did  the Beni Merin recognise him than he was set at liberty. Then came the news of the death  of Abi Mohammed Ibn Abi Hafss, Lord of Eastern Africa, whom Al-mustanser immediately  replaced by Sid Abi-l-’ola, brother of Al-mansiir, then governor of Seville. After this,  however, Al-mustanser deposed him, and appointed in his room Si’ayah Ibn Muthana,'?  who repaired thither, as we shall hereafter relate when we come to treat of the Beni  Abi Hafss.   About this time there appeared in the territory of Fez a man of the family of the ’Obeydites,  who claimed descent from Al-’édhed,* and assumed the surname of Mahdi. Al-mustanser  sent against him [his uncle] Abi Ibrahim, the brother of Al-manstr. On his arrival at Fez,  this general bribed some of the partisans of the rebel, who seized him, and brought him into  his presence, when he was immediately put to death. In the year 619 (beginning Feb. 14,  A.D. 1222), Al-mustanser gave to his uncle, Abi Mohammed, better known under the  surname of Al-’4dil, the investiture of Murcia, after removing him from the government of  Granada, which he held. After this the state was disturbed [by wars and seditions]. Al-  mustanser died in the year 620 (a.p. 1223).    % The MS, reads thus yg doy) dd!

"    APPENDIX. Ixxi    Reign of ’Abdu-l-wihed Al-makhlw’, the deposed brother of Al-mansir.    On the death of Al-mustanser, which happened on the day of *Jdu-L-adhihi of the year 620  (Jan. 4, A.D. 1224), Ibn Jami’ and the Almohades having united their councils, appointed as  his successor Sid Abi Mohammed * ’Abdu-l-wahed, brother of Al-mansir, who was accord-  ingly proclaimed.   On his accession to power, ’Abdu-l-wéhed gave orders that a sum of money should be  offered to the rebel Ibn Asharfi, on condition of his laying down his arms. He also wrote  to confirm his own brother, Abi-l-’ola, in the government of Eastern Africa, notwithstanding  that Al-mustanser [who had been prepossessed against him] had long contemplated his  removal; but, as Abi-l-’ola was dead when the confirmation reached him, he was succeeded  by his son, Abi Zeyd Al-mushammar, who declared himself independent in those provinces,  as we shall hereafter relate when we come to narrate the events of Eastern Africa. After this  the Sultan sent down his orders to Murcia for the release of Ibn Tiijén [Abi Zeyd], who, as  before related, was confined in the castle of that city; and it was done as he commanded,  against the advice of [his Wizir] Ibn Jémi’, who was of a contrary opinion. ’Abdu-l-wéhed  also sent his brother, Abu Is’hék, with a fleet to assail the island of Mallorca, as his prede-  cessor, Al-mustanser, had done before he died.   About this time a son of Al-mansiir, named Abi Mohammed ’Abdullah, who was governor  of Murcia, revolted against the Sultan, at the instigation of Ibn Tujén [Abi Zeyd]. This  man [who was his Wizir at the time] had prevailed on him to rise and seize on the empire,  by asserting—which assertion he proved by witnesses—that he [Ibn Tijén] had heard  Al-mansitr designate him for his heir to the Khalifate in the event of An-ndsir’s death.  As the people were discontented with the administration of Ibn Jémi’, and the governors of  Andalus happened all to be the sons of Al-manstir, and favourable to his views; and as he  had, in the first instance, opposed his uncle’s proclamation, Abi Mohammed found no  difficulty in seizing on the empire, which he did, assuming on the occasion the surname  of Al-’édil. All his brothers [in Andalus] hastened, though in secret, to take the oath  of allegiance to him. These were Abi-l-’ola, governor of Cordova; Abi-l-hasan, governor  of Granada; and Abi Misa, governor of Malaga. On the other hand, ’Abdu-l-wéhed  having removed Abi Mohammed Ibn Abf ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Abi Hafss Ibn  *Abdi-l-mimen, better known by the surname of Al-bdyes{ (of Baeza), from his govern-  ment of Jaen, which he gave to his uncle Abt-r-rabi? Ibn Abi Hafss, the deposed governor  also joined the insurgents and proclaimed Al-’édil. Having then joined his forces to those of  Abi-l-’ola, governor of Cordova, who was also Al-’édil’s brother, they both marched to  Seville, where a brother of Al-manstir and of ’Abdu-l-wéhed commanded at the time.  *Abdu-l-’aziz, for such was his name, immediately embraced their party: the only one  who refused to take the oath of allegiance to Al-’édil, and who remained faithful to    5 Conde (vol. ii. p. 432) calls him Abi-l-mélik. % He was so called on account of his living afterwards at Baeza.",653,,
"    Ixxii APPENDIX.    *Abdu-l-wéhed, was Sid Abi Zeyd Ibn Abf ’Abdillah, the brother of Al-bdyesf. However,  Al~édil marched from Murcia to Seville, taking in his company Abi Zeyd Ibn Tiijén, and  made his entrance into that city. When this intelligence reached Morocco, the Almohades  declared against *Abdu-l-wéhed, and compelled their monarch to deprive Ibn Jémi’ of his  office, and to exile him to Heskirah. About the same time, Abii Zakariyyé Yahya Ibn  Abi Yahya Ash-shahid Ibn Abf Hafss rose with the tribe of Hentétah, whilst Yusuf Ibn  °Alf did the same with that of Tinmelel. He [’Abdu-l-wahed] sent Abi Is’hék Ibn Jami’  to station himself with the fleet in the Straits [of Gibraltar], to prevent the passage of  ships from Andalus. He also sent a secret message to Ibn Jami’, who had set out for  Heskiirah, enjoining him to return to him; but he failed in all his plans, being soon after  dethroned, and privately put to death in Rabi’ ” of the year 621 (from March 22 to May 19,  A.D. 1224), when the Almohades sent in their allegiance to Al-’édil.    Reign of Al-’ddil, son of Al-mansir.    Al~dil received the oaths of the Almohades at the same time with a letter of Zakariyyé  Ibnu-sh-shahid, announcing to him the capture of [’Abdu-l-wahed] the deposed Sultén.  Upon this, Al-béyesi [Abi Mohammed], who knew well the ill-will which that monarch bore  him, decided to revolt against him, and to assume the supreme power at Baeza, which he  did, under the surname of Adh-dhdfir, remaining for some time undisturbed. Al~dil then  sent against him his own brother, Abi-l-’ola, who besieged that city, but could not reduce  it? After this, Al-*édil dispatched Abi Sa’id, son of the Sheikh Abt Hafss, who was also  unsuccessful. In the mean time affairs were daily presenting a worse aspect in Andalus  against Al~ddil. The Christians made repeated incursions into the neighbourhood of Seville,  where Abi-]l-’ola was residing at the time, and defeated the troops of the Almohades near  Tablada. In Africa, Al-’ddil’s courtiers instigated him against Ibn Tiijén, who was seized  and conveyed prisoner to Ceuta. Mean while the party of Al-bayesi waxed stronger in  Andalus through the means of the Christians, who lent him assistance. Seeing this, Al-’adil  determined to send troops to Andalus, to re-inforce his brother, Abi-l-’ola.® As he was at  Kasr-al-mejéz, ’Abik® Ibn Abi Mohammed, son of the Sheikh Abii Hafss, arrived there,         87 First or second is here wanting, as there are two months so called. Conde says that he was deposed on the 13th of  Safar, 621 (March 6, a.p. 1224), and murdered three days after; but the dates given by the author of the Karttds,  whence the Spanish translator borrowed his narrative, are very different. The African historian places the former event on  the 21st of Sha’ban, 621 (Sept. 5, a.p. 1224). On the following day, which was a Sunday, the oath of allegiance was  publicly taken to Al-’édil, and thirteen days after, (on the 14th Ramadhén,) he was strangled. See the Karttés, by Moura,  p. 269.   68 The author of the Karttds says that he was obliged to capitulate, and swear allegiance to the Sultén; but no sooner  had the enemy retired from before Baeza, than Al-béyes{ wrote to Alfonso, and entered into an alliance with him against  Al.’édil.   © The text hert is doubtless corrupted, but I have not the means of correcting it: APL ty dsl APY Jol je    toil de dal Us! © Ge         ",654,,
"    APPENDIX. Lxxiii    and entered his presence. Al-’édil having said to him, “ How farest thou?” he replied in  verse.! Al-édil was so pleased with his answer that he appointed him governor of Eastern  Africa. He wrote to his cousin, Sid Abi Zeyd, to come to him to Salé. Abu Zeyd did as  he was commanded. The Sultén then spent some time at this place, and sent for the  Sheikhs of the neighbouring tribes. Among those who came on this occasion was Helél Ibn  Hamidén Ibn Mukaddam, Anir of the tribe of Al-khalatt, with whom Ibn Tujén happened to  be on terms of great intimacy. Another chieftain, named Ibn Jarmtn, who was then Amir of  the tribe of Sufyén, not choosing to obey the summons, the tribes of Al-khalatt and Sufyén  fought with one another. Upon this, Al-’édil hastened to Morocco, where, immediately upon  his arrival, he showed his resentment against Ibn Tiijan, by depriving him of his office, and  appointing in his room Abii Zeyd Ibn Abi Mohammed, son of the Sheikh Abi Hafss. Ibn  Tdjan having fallen into disgrace [with his master], Ibnu-sh-shahid and Yusuf Ibn ’Ali,  Sheikhs of the tribes of Hentétah and Tinmelel, seized on the supreme power. This was fol-  lowed by the revolt of [the tribes of] Hesktirah and Al-khalatt, who made an incursion into  the territory of Morocco. Ibn Tiijén went out to meet them, but gained no advantage over  the invaders, who completely ravaged the country of Dukélah. Al-’édil then sent against them  an army of Almohades under the command of Ibréhim Ibn Ism@’il, son of the Sheikh Abi  Hafss, the same who had opposed the sons of the Sheikh Abi Mohammed in Eastern Africa,  as we shall hereafter relate; but he also was defeated and put to death. Ibnu-sh-shahid and  Yusuf Ibn ’Alf then went to their respective tribes, assembled their forces, and took the  field against the tribe of Heskiirah; they likewise agreed to deprive Al-’édil of the command,  and to proclaim in his stead Yahya, son of An-nésir. Accordingly, having arrived at  Morocco, they made a sudden attack upon the royal palace, which they plundered of all  its valuables, and seized the person of Al-’édil, who was strangled on the day of Al-fitr,  or 24th of Shawwél of the year 624 (Oct. 7, a. p. 1227).    Reign of Al-mdmiin, son of Al-mansir.   Al~édil had a brother named Idris Al-mémin, who was governor of Seville. When the  intelligence of the revolt of the Almohades and Arabs against his brother, and the overthrow  of his empire, reached him, Al-mémiin, who, as before stated, was governor of Seville, rose in  that city and had himself proclaimed by the inhabitants, the example being soon followed  by most of the people of Andalus, as well as by Sid Abi Zeyd, governor of Valencia  and the eastern parts of Andalus, who hastened to send in his allegiance. Then came  the events above recorded; the rising of the Almohades against Al-’édil, his execution  at Al-kasr, and the election of Yahya, his cousin, son of An-ndsir. Ibn Tiijén then entered  into a secret correspondence [with some of his partisans], and aimed at the overthrow  of the established dynasty.

"    xxiv APPENDIX.    made an incursion into the territory of Morocco, and defeated an army of Almohades that  sallied out to oppose them. But Ibnu-sh-shahid having discovered the secret machinations  of Ibn Tuijaén, surprised him one day in his house, and put him to death. Then Yahya  Ibn An-nésir went out to his friends as above related, and the Almohades deposed him,  and sent their allegiance to Al-mémin. The principal actors in this last revolution were  Abi ’Abdillah Al-gherighor and Sid Abi Hafss Ibn Abi Hafss. When the intelligence  reached Yahya Ibn An-nésir and Ibnu-sh-shahid, they laid siege to Morocco in the year 626  (beginning Nov. 29, a. p. 1228), and put the conspirators to death. However, the party of  Al-mémiin waxed every day stronger. The governor of Fez, as well as Mohammed Ibn Abi  Zeyd Ibn Tujén, governor of Telemsén, Abi Musa Ibn Al-manstir, governor of Ceuta, and  his cousin, Ibnu-l-attés,* governor of Bujéyah, all embraced his party. The only one who  resisted was Abi Zakariyy4, governor of Eastern Africa, and this resistance was the cause of  his subsequent rebellion, since, as we shall relate hereafter, he afterwards declared himself  independent in that country. In short, nothing remained under the rule of Yahya Ibn  An-nésir except Sijilmésah and Eastern Africa.   Whilst these events were passing in Africa, Al-béyesi marched against Cordova and gained  possession of it. Thence he went to Seville in company with his ally, the King of the  Christians, to whom he had given over the castle of Kijéttah ® (Quesada), and other fortresses  ” belonging to the Moslems. Al-mdmiin, however, went out of Seville and met the enemy,  whom he defeated with great loss, obliging Al-béyesi to take refuge in Cordova. Finding,  on his arrival at this place, that the inhabitants had risen against him, Al-bdyesi fled to  a neighbouring castle called Al-mudowwar (Almodovar), where he was soon after treacherously  put to death by his own Wizir, Ibn Biurak,“ who hastened to Seville to present his head to  Al-mémiin. After this came the rebellion of Mohammed Ibn Yusuf Ibn Huid, who gained  possession of Murcia and the greater part of Eastern Andalus, as we have related in our  account of him. Al-m&miin marched against him and besieged him, but he defended himself  bravely; and Al-m4miin, unable to conquer him, returned to Seville.   After this, in the year 626 (beginning Nov. 29, a. p. 1228), Al-mamiin repaired to Morocco,  on the solicitation of the people of Africa, who wished for his presence, and had previously  sent him their allegiance. Heldél Ibn Hamidén, Amfr of the tribe of Al-khalatt, had also  implored his assistance, and begged him to come over. Before embarking, Al-mémiin asked  the Christian king to give him a body of troops to serve under his orders in Africa; and this  request being granted on terms stipulated between the two monarchs, Al-md4mun put to sea  with his Christian auxiliaries. No sooner, however, had Al-mdmin quitted the shores of  Andalus, than the people of Seville revolted against him, and sent their allegiance to Ibn Hiid.   At his landing on the coast of Africa, Al-mamtn was met by Yahya Ibn An-nésir, whom  he completely defeated, after a sharp encounter, making great slaughter among his followers,  the Almohades and Arabs: Yahya fled to the mountains of Hentétah.® After this victory  Al-mémiin gained possession of the capital (Morocco).

He then sent circulars throughout the provinces of his empire,  commanding that the name of the Mahdi should no longer be struck on the coins,  or proclaimed from the pulpits of the mosques; that in the call to prayer [which was  made] in the Berber language no mention should be made [as before] of the death of  that individual; that the words Asboh Wa lillahi-i-hamdu (rise and praise God), which the  Mahdi had caused to be added to the formula of convocation for the prayer of al-fajr  (day-break), should be suppressed, as well as other peculiar practices introduced by him,  which had been respected and strictly kept by ’Abdu-l-mimen and his descendants, the  ancestors of Al-mémiin. He even meditated doing away with every one of the religious  precepts imposed by the founder of that sect, and ridiculed the people for describing the  Mahdi as a man under the protection of Heaven. He went still further, and made himself  guilty of other excesses. In compliance with the treaty entered into with the infidel king,  he gaye the Christians who came over with him permission to build a church within the  precincts of Morocco; which they did, tolling their bells daily.   In the mean time Ibn Hiid had reduced almost the whole of Andalus, and expelled  therefrom the Almohades, who fell every where victims to the infuriated mob. Among those  who perished on this occasion was Sid Abu-r-rabi’, the nephew of Al-mansiir, who had been  governor of Cordova ever since the reign of that Sultén. In this extremity Al-m4miin sent  orders to Abi Zakariyy4 Ibn Abi Mohammed, grandson of the Sheikh Abii Hafss, who was  governor of Eastern Africa, to come to his assistance; but not only did he refuse to  do so, but some time after, in the year 629 (beginning Oct. 28, a.p. 1231), he shook off  all allegiance due to him. However, Al-maémiin gave his cousin, Sid Abi *Imrén, son of  his uncle Mohammed Al-hardhéni, the government of Bujéyah; at the same time appointing  Abi ’Abdillah Al-lehiyani,® brother of the Amir Abi Zakariyyé [to act as his Wizir]).  Yahya Ibn An-ndsir marched against him [Al-mémin], but was defeated. Again, a second  time, Yahya attacked his adversary, but he was defeated with the loss of many of his  followers, whose heads were fixed on spikes to the walls of Morocco. After these defeats  Yahya Ibn An-nésir fled to the countries of Dar’ah and Sijilmésah.   Some time after this, happened the revolt of a brother of Al-mémin, named Abii Misa,  who caused himself to be proclaimed at Ceuta, and assumed the surname of Al-muyyed-billah.  Al-mamiin left Morocco to reduce him; but having heard on his road to that city (Ceuta)  that the tribes of the Beni Fezér and Nekayah had laid siege to Meknésah (Mequinez), and  were committing all manner of ravages in its neighbourhood, he decided to abandon his  former purpose, and repair to those districts. He did so; and after applying a cautery  to that wound, returned to Ceuta, which he besieged for three consecutive months. Abi  Miisa then sent to Andalus, to implore the assistance of Ibn Hid, Lord of that country,  who granted his request, and sent a powerful fleet to his succour. Whilst Al-m4min was  occupied in the siege of Ceuta, Yahya Ibn An-nésir, accompanied by the Arabian tribe of         He was called sys Al-lehiyéni because he had a very fine beard. His name was Mohammed.—Ibnu Khaldén,  fo. 135. .",657,,
"    Ixxvi APPENDIX.    Sufyan and their Sheikh, Jarmiin Ibn ’Isa, as well as by Abu Sa’fd Ibn W4niidin, the Sheikh  of the tribe ef Hentétah, made a sudden incursion into the territory of Morocco, and ravaged  the country all around. When this intelligence was brought to Al-maémiin, he raised the siege  of Ceuta, and started off in pursuit of his enemy; but he died on the road at Wéda Umm  Rabi’, in the beginning of 630 (a.p. 1232). When Abt Misa saw his brother raise the  siege, he placed himself under the obedience of Ibn Hid, and gave him possession of Ceuta,  to which city that Sultén appointed a new governor.    The people of Valencia, Murcia, and the eastern provinces of Andalus, proclaim the Sultin Abi  Zakariyyd Ibn Abi Hafss, and send an embassy to him.    During the course of these events, Abi Jemil Zeyyan, son of Abu-l-hamalét Mudéfi’ Ibn  Abi-]-hejaj Ibn Sa’d Ibn Mardanish, took Valencia from Sid Abi Zeyd, son of Sid Moham-  med, son of Sid Abii Hafss, and caused himself to be proclaimed king of that city and the  surrounding districts. About this time, as “above related, the empire of the Beni ’Abdi-l-  mimen was fast declining every where in Andalus. We have related how Ibn Hid revolted  against Al-md4miin and waged war with him: another chieftain, named Ibnu-l-ahmar, rose  also at Arjona; and in short the whole of Andalus became a prey to civil war. This state of  things being observed by the Christian kings, they began to wreak their fury on every point  of the Moslem frontier. The King of Aragon (Jayme) marched towards Valencia, which he  besieged. This was in the year 633 (beginning Sept. 15, a. p. 1235). In order the better  to surround the Moslems, the Christian king formed seven large camps: he had two in  front of Valencia, one at Jezirah Shukar (Alcira), and another at Xativa; the remainder  were in Jaen, Tavira,” Murcia, and Liblah (Niebla). Besides these forces brought to act  against the Moslems of Andalus, the Genoese [with a fleet] were upon Ceuta. Some time  after, the King of Castile [Ferdinand III.] took Cordova, while the King of Aragon reduced  most of the fortresses round Valencia and Alcira. The latter built a fortress called Anisah,@  from which to besiege Valencia, and, after quartering his forces in it, retired to his dominions.  Zeyyén Ibn Mardanish then decided to make a sally and attack the besieging forces. To  this end he sent to ask the people of Alcira to assist him in his undertaking. Having  obtained the re-inforcements he wanted, he marched against the enemy, but he was com-  pletely defeated, with the loss of the greater part of his followers. On that disastrous day,  which was like the harbinger of the taking of Valencia by the Christians, several men eminent  for their talents or their virtues died martyrs for the faith; among others, Abi-r-rabi’ Ibn  Sélim, the chief of the traditionists of Andalus. Subsequently to this the Christians made  several incursions in the neighbourhood of Valencia, until the month of Ramadhan, 635  (April or May, a. p. 1238), when the King of Aragon in person appeared before the city, and         © This would make eight, not seven, as above.

"    APPENDIX. Ixxvii    began to press the siege with the utmost vigour. In the mean time, fortune forsook the  banners of the Beni ’Abdi-l-mtimen of Morocco, whose empire passed into other hands; the  Beni Abi Hafss becoming the rulers of Eastern Africa. Not expecting any assistance from  the former, Ibn Mardanjsh and the people of Eastern Andalus decided upon applying to the  latter, and imploring the help of Abi Zakariyyé Ibn Abi Hafss (the reigning Sultan of that  family), whom they proclaimed their sovereign. Accordingly that chieftain dispatched to  him his secretary, the Faquih Abu ’Abdillah Ibnu-l-abbér, who arrived in this country and  brought their oath of allegiance, and then recited in the presence of Abii Zakariyy4 that  celebrated kassidah of his, rhyming in the letter sin, which begins thus:  “ Hasten to Andalus with thy mounted warriors, the soldiers of God, before the paths  “ of salvation are entirely obliterated.  “ Go and bestow on her thy powerful assistance, since the help of thy victorious arms  “ is never withdrawn from the needy.  “ Thy presence will restore life to her sinking body, after tasting morn and evening of  “ the cup of woe.  “ To the island, then, whose inhabitants are so many victims destined for sacrifice, and  « whose sufferings cannot otherwise be terminated than by a speedy death.”   The Amir granted the request of the people of Valencia, and sent to their assistance a fleet  loaded with provisions, stores, and money, under the orders of Abii Yahya Ibn Yahya Ibnu-s-  shahid Abi Ishék Ibn Abi Hafss. The total cost of the armament was one hundred thousand  dinérs. The fleet reached the shores of Valencia at a time when the inhabitants were suffering  all the privations and horrors of the siege, and cast anchor at Denia, where it landed all the  stores; but the admiral seeing that Ibn Mardanish did not send thither any one to take charge  of them, set sail and returned to Africa. The siege, in the mean while, was pressed more  and more, until the provisions were entirely exhausted, and the people died through hunger.  Negotiations then began for the surrender of the city, which was finally given up to Jakmek  (Jayme), King of Aragon, in the month of Safar of the year 636 (Sept. a.p. 1238). Ibn  Mardanish left Valencia for Jezirah Shukar (Alcira), where, immediately upon his arrival, he  exacted from the inhabitants the oath of allegiance to the Amir Abi Zakariyyé. Ibnu-l-abbér  returned to Tiinis, where he took up his residence, becoming one of the courtiers of the Sultén.   The enemy, however, pursued his conquests. Ibn Mardanish was besieged in Alcira, and  compelled to abandon that city, and to take refuge in Denia, into which he made his entry in  Rejeb of the same year (Feb. or March, a.p. 1239). Having there caused his sovereign,  Abi Zakarriyé, to be proclaimed, Ibn Mardanfsh tried to do the same at Murcia, where         © UGS Lyles Cot uel GE a alll us Se?

"    Ixxviii APPENDIX.    a chieftain named Abi Bekr *Aziz Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn Khattéb had reigned since the  commencement of the year 636 (August 13, a. p. 1238), having been proclaimed king by the  inhabitants. In Ramadhan of the same year, Ibn Mardanish succeeded in his attempt.  Having gained possession of Murcia, he put to death its ruler [Ibn Khattéb],’° and sent the  allegiance of the inhabitants to Abii Zakariyydé. In this manner were the eastern provinces  of Andalus reduced under the sway of the Beni Abi Hafss. The messengers sent by Ibn  Mardanish to Tunis returned in 637 (beginning Aug. 2, a. p. 1239), bringing him the inves-  titure of all those districts which had through his means acknowledged the supremacy of  the Beni Abi Hafss. Ibn Mardanish retained the government of them, until, in the year  638 (beginning July 22, a.p. 1240), Ibn Hid” took the city of Murcia, and obliged  him to seek shelter in the fortresses which still held to their allegiance for him. Ibn Hid,  moreover, maintained himself in Murcia until the city was finally taken by the King of  Barcelona [Jayme] in the year 644 (beginning May 18, a. p. 1246),7? when he crossed the  sea to Tiinis.”* God alone is eternal!    The inhabitants of Andalus come under the rule of the Bent Abt Hafss. Arrival at Tunis of  messengers bringing the allegiance of the people of Seville and other great cities.    There were about this time at Seville two influential citizens, one of whom was named  Abii Merwén Ahmed Al-b4ji, who was a descendant of Abu-l-walid [Al-béjf], and the other,  Abi ’Amru Ibnv-l-jadd, of the posterity of the celebrated traditionist, Abii Bekr (Ibnu-l-jadd).  These two men, whose ancestors had enjoyed great favour with the Khalifs [of the house of  Umeyyah], had inherited considerable property and influence. They were held in great  estimation and respect by the people of Seville, who never failed to consult them in arduous  points of law, and looked up to them in every emergency. All the princes of the family  of ’Abdu-l-miimen who had held command in Andalus had moreover appointed them to  offices of trust, and admitted them into their council. We have seen how, after the death of  Al-mustanser, the affairs of Andalus had fallen into the worst possible state, the relatives  of that monarch dividing his dominions among themselves. About the same time Ibn         7 He was the descendant of Ahmed Ibn Khattéb, of Murcia, surnamed Al-khazen{ (of the hoarded treasures), who, on  the return of Al-mansir [Ibn Ab{ ’Amir] from his expedition to Catalonia in a. . 374, entertained him most munificently  during his stay in that city. See Conde, vol. ii. p. 153; and Casiri, vol. i. p. 64. The former of these writers places the  death of Ibnu-]-khattéb on the 26th of Ramadhén, 640 (March 18, a.p. 1243), and says that he was killed near Lecant  (Alicante) ; but what faith can be placed in the statements of an author whose narrative swarms with the greatest blunders?  who, in the course of a few pages, makes Ibn Khattéb sometimes governor of Lorca, and sometimes of Murcia; who speaks  of two kings of the latter city, Alf Ibn Had, and Mohammed Ibn ’Alf Ibn Hid, the latter of whom he also calls governor of  Lorca? Compare vol. ii. p. 20 et segg.   7 This Ibn Had seems to be the Abenhudiel of the Cronica General, fo. ceccxiii. et passim.   7 Tbnu-l-khattib places the taking of Murcia in 640, alluding, no doubt, to the first occupation of that city by the Infante  Don Alfonso in 1241. The city, however, seems to have fallen again into the hands of the Moslems; for, on the 13th of  February, a. D. 1265, it was taken by Don Pedro, son of King Jayme of Aragon, who undertook its conquest on behalf of  Ferdinand FMI. of Castile, to whose dominions it was annexed.

Mad. 1621, fo. 18.   7 It is not easy to say, from the ambiguous manner in which this passage is conceived, whether it was Ibn Mardanish or  Ibn Hid who crossed over to Africa. I am inclined to believe it was the latter.",660,,
"    APPENDIX. Ixxix    Hid” and Zeyyén Ibn Mardanish raised the standard of revolt in the eastern provinces, while  Ibnu-l-ahmar rose in arms in the west. The former was every where successful against the  Almohades, whom he expelled from several cities. Having reduced Seville in 626 (beginning  Noy. 29, a.p. 1228), he confined in prison the Almohade [princes] who were there, and  took possession of the place, where he maintained himself until he lost it in 629 (beginning  Oct. 28, 1231), by a revolt of the inhabitants. After expelling his brother Abu-n-nejét Salim,  whom he had left to command in his absence, the people of Seville proclaimed Al-béjf,  who took, upon his accession, the surname of Al-mu’tadhed, and appointed Abi Bekr Ibn  Séhibi-r-radd to be his Wizir. The example of Seville was soon followed by the people  of Carmona, who also proclaimed Al-baji. On the receipt of this intelligence, Ibn Hud  hastened to Seville, which city he besieged; but Al-baji having made an alliance with  Mohammed Ibnu-l-ahmar, who, after the taking of Cordova [by the Christians], had risen at  Arjona and Jaen, that chief hastened to his assistance. Ibn Hud, however, met them at the  head of his forces, but he was defeated, and put to flight. The victors after this returned  to their respective states, Ibnu-l-ahmar to Arjona, and Al-béji to his capital [Seville], where  he encamped outside the walls. Subsequently to this, Ibnu-l-ahmar, seeing the opportunity  at hand to possess himself of Seville, sent thither a relative of his, named Ibn Ashkililah,  with some of the troops of Arjona, and a division of Christians. Having made a sudden  and unexpected attack upon the tents of Al-b4jf, they took him and his Wizir prisoners, and  put both of them to death. This happened in the year 631 (beginning Oct. 6, a.p. 1233).  Ibnu-l-ahmar then made his entry into Seville, but scarcely had he been there a month  when the inhabitants rose against him, and returned to the obedience of Ibn Hud, who again  appointed his own brother, Abii-n-nejaét Sdlim, to govern them.   On the death of Ibn Htid, which happened in 635 (a.p. 1238), the people of Seville  returned to their obedience to the Almohades of Africa, proclaiming as their sovereign the  Sultén Ar-rashid, who then reigned at Morocco. In the mean time, and until a governor  should be appointed, they elected Mohammed, son of Sid Abi ’Imrén, of whom we have  already spoken as being governor of Constantina at the time that city was taken by Abii  Zakariyyé. Abi *Imrén was taken prisoner, and confined in a dungeon. As to his son  Mohammed, he was transported to Seville, where his mother, who then resided in that city,  took care of his education. This was the individual whom the citizens of Seville set over  themselves whilst they sent their allegiance to Ar-rashid. They were directed on this  occasion by the advice of Abi ’Amru Ibnu-l-jadd. On the arrival of the ambassadors at  court, Ar-rashid granted their request, and confirmed Abu ’Abdillah [Mohammed] in the  government of Seville. Things remained in this state until the death of Ar-rashfd, which  happened in 640 (a.p. 1242), when the people of Seville, hearing that Abi Zakariyyé  {Ibn Abi Hafss] had taken Telemsén, and was threatening other provinces of Western  Africa, did as the people of Valencia, Murcia, and other cities of Eastern Andalus had done,  and proclaimed the Amir Abt Zakariyyé Ibn Abi Mohammed Ibn Abi Hafss; their example  being speedily followed by the people of Xerez and Tarifa, who also sent their messengers         # Mohammed Ibn Yusuf Ibn Hid, surnamed Al-mutfawdkkel alai-lah.",661,,
"    lxxx APPENDIX.    bearing their allegiance in 641 (beginning June 20, a.p. 1243), and requesting him to  appoint a prince of his family to command over them. The Amir acceded to their wishes,  and named his nephew Abi Faris, son of Ytinas, and grandson of the Sheikh Abi Hafss,  who arrived in Seville, and took possession of the government, Ibnu-l-jadd hastening to  surrender all his authority into his hands. Subsequently to this, in the year 643 (beginning  May 28, a.p. 1245), Ibnu-l-jadd having revolted against Abi Faris, deposed him from  the government of the city, and banished him to Ceuta, himself remaining sole master of  Seville. Ibnu-l-jadd then made peace, and contracted an alliance with the Christian king, and  {in order to insure its continuance] proceeded to strike out of the rolls of the army his  best Almogfvares7> or frontier soldiers. These, however, became so incensed at the measure  taken by Ibnu-l-jadd, that they revolted aginst him, and. put him to death at the instigation  of a captain of theirs, named Sakkéf, who assumed the command of Seville. This Sakkéf,  having sent for Abi Faris Ibn Abi Hafss, replaced him in his post of governor for Abi  Zakariyyé. This offended the Christian king, who, taking the murder of his ally Ibnu-l-  jadd as a pretext for declaring war against the rebels, took Carmona and Marsénah  (Marchena), and subsequently laid siege to Seville. The people then sued for peace, but  this the Christian arrogantly refused to grant. The administration of affairs was then vested  in a council composed of the following individuals: the captain of the Almogavares, Sakkéf,  Ibn Sho’ayb, Yahya Ibn Khaldiin,”® Masid Ibn Khiydr, and Abi Bekr Ibn Sharth, over  which presided Abt Féris Ibn Abi Hafss.   The siege lasted for two consecutive years, Ibnu-l-ahmar serving under the Christian king  with a body of troops. The Amir Abi Zakariyyé sent to their assistance a fleet under  the command of Abi-r-rabi’ Al-’aziz At-tinmeleli, who having been requested by the people  of Ceuta to allow them to join their fleet to his, acceded to their solicitations, and sailed  up the river of Seville (Guadalquivir) ; but he was beaten by the Christian fleet, who defended  the entrance of the port, and was obliged to return. At last, the enemy gained possession  of the city by capitulation in the year 646 (a. p. 1248), after a siege of fifteen months, during  which time Ibnu-l-ahmar, as before related, assisted the Christians with men and provisions.  The Christian king appointed over the guilty inhabitants of Seville ’Abdu-l-hakk Ibn Abi  Mohammed Al-béyesf, of the posterity of ’Abdu-l-mimen. There is no God but God!  His is the empire!              7 yee!

The author of the  chronological history of the Spanish Moors, published in the Art de verifier les dates, vol. iii. p. 68, has unduly ridiculed  Cardonne for stating that Seville became a republic before it was taken by the Christians; for, although the form of  government adopted by the inhabitants on that occasion cannot strictly be called a republic, it was nevertheless contrary  to all Moslem notions of government.",662,,
