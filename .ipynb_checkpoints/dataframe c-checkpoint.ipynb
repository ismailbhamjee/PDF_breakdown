      "”  who settled in it, and gave it his name, in like manner as his brother sebt, son  of yafeth, peopled the opposite land, and gave his name to the city of sebtah  (ceuta)\n",
      " ibnu ghélib? follows the same opinion, but makes andalus to be the son  of y4feth\n",
      " ibnu hayyén,? ibnu khaldin,* and others, derive it from andalosh,®  a nation of barbarians who settled there\n",
      " this latter opinion seems the most  probable ; but god is all-knowing\n",
      "he country of andalus (may god restore it entire to the moslems !) has been cimate\n",
      "  described both by native and foreign writers in the most pompous terms\n",
      " the  wizir lisénu-d-din® ibnu-l-khattib, (may god show him mercy!) in one of his  historical works, says as follows: ‘‘ god almighty has distinguished this our  “country by endowing it with gentle hills and fertile plains, sweet and wholesom\n",
      "“ food, a great number of useful animals, plenty of fruits, abundance of waters,  “comfortable dwellings, good clothing, beautiful vases, and utensils of every  “* description ; fine weapons, a pure and wholesome air, a slow succession of the  ‘* seasons of the year\n",
      " he has also endowed its inhabitants with great aptitude for  “« the sciences and the arts of domestic life ; acuteness of mind, quickness of intel-  “ lect ; courage, ardent love of every thing which is noble, and many other brilliant  “« qualities, which are not to be found united in people of any other country\n",
      "\n",
      "bt ’obeyd-illah al-bekri al-andalusi? compares his native country to shém  (syria) for purity of air and sweetness of waters, to yemen for mildness of tempera-  ture, which is every where the same, to hind (india) for drugs and aromatic plants,  to al-ahwéz® for the magnitude of its snakes, to china for mines and precious  stones, to ’aden for the number and security of its coasts and harbours\n",
      "bi ’a’mir as-salémi,® in his work entitled ‘ durru-i-kildyid wa ghurruru-l-  fawdyid, (pearls of the necklaces, and stars of useful things,) says that andalus  belongs to the climate of sham (syria) ; that which, of all those into which the  earth is divided, is reckoned the best and most temperate, which has the finest land  and waters, and which abounds most in animals, fruits, and productions of all kinds :  “ that climate,” he adds, ‘‘ occupies a middle place among the other climates, and  ‘is therefore considered the best, it being well known that the most preferable  “« portion of any thing is that which is in the middle\n",
      "\n",
      "he sheikh ahmed ibn mohammed ibn misa ar-rézi!® says that andalus  is situated at the extremity of the fourth climate towards the west, and that  all learned authors agree in describing it as a country with delightful valleys,  and fertile lands, rich in all sorts of agricultural productions, watered by many  large rivers, and abounding in springs of the sweetest waters\n",
      " it contains but  few wild beasts, or venomous reptiles ; the air in winter is mild, and the coolest  breezes temper the heat of summer\n",
      " the climate is so temperate all the year  round as to make the transition from one season to another almost imperceptible ;  in fact, it may be said that a perpetual spring reigns all over andalus, this  being the reason why most of the fruits of earth grow in all seasons, and the  crops succeed one another without interruption ; owing, too, to the different  qualities of the soil, the same produce may be obtained all the year round in  various provinces of andalus ; as, for instance, on the coast and the lands adjoining  to it all fruits of the earth are very forward, while in the thagher™ and its  districts, and especially on the mountains, where the air is colder, they are, on  the contrary, very backward\n",
      " most of its fruits, also, partake of a flavour and  beauty which are not common to those of other countries\n",
      "’\n",
      "hat andalus is situate in the fourth climate appears sufficiently demonstrate\n",
      "by the words of the geographer idrisi, as quoted by ibnu sa’id: ‘‘ andalus,”  says that author, ‘‘has no portion of its territory within the third climate, but  “the fourth passes by its southern coast, and includes cordova, seville, murcia,  “and valencia; thence it goes towards sicily, encloses this and other islands in  “the neighbourhood, leaving the sun at the back\n",
      " the fifth passes by toleytoleh  “ toledo), sarakostah (saragossa) and the environs; then by arghon’* (aragon),  “at the southern extremity of which is the city of barshelénah (barcelona), thence  “it proceeds to rome and the country subject to that city, divides the bahru-l-  “ banddikeh (gulf of venice) into two parts, and comprises costantiniyeh the  “ great (constantinople) and its territory, leaving behind the planet called  “ az-zahrah (venus)\n",
      " the sixth passes by the northern coast of andalus,  “that which is washed by the waters of the circumambient sea, includes part of  “ castile* and portugal,'® a great portion of the country of the franks, georgia,  “and the country of the sclavonians and russians, leaving behind the planet  “called ’ottdrid (mercury)\n",
      " the seventh comprises the circumambient sea to  “the north of andalus, the island called alinkilterrah'® (england) and others  “in the neighbourhood, as well as the remainder of the countries of the franks  “and sclavonians, georgia, and berjén\n",
      "'\"\"—according to al-beyhaki'® the island  “ of tili,’® and the two islands of al-ajbél? (norway) and an-nisé”! (amazones)  “and several other districts of russia, fall within the limits of this seventh and  “ last climate, which has the moon at its back\n",
      "\n",
      "especting the name of al-jeztrah (the island) by which all authors agree in  designating andalus, it must not be understood by it that that country is, properly  speaking, an island ; since it is well known to be joined to the great land (continent)  by the chain of mountains called al-bort™ (pyrenees), but the arabs in general  all by this name all those countries which are surrounded by water on every side  but one, and this being the case with andalus, it was called al-jeztrah\n",
      " two  principal seas wash the shores of andalus; on the northern and western side  the circumambient sea (ocean), on the southern and eastern the sea of shdm  (mediterranean)\n",
      " by the sea of shém we understand that sea which begins at  the lower extremity of andalus, at a place on its south-western coast called  jeziratu-l-khadhrdé® (algesiras), between tangiers in africa and the coast of  andalus, taking from thence its course towards syria\n",
      " the width of this sea  at the said spot is generally stated at eighteen’ miles ; which is also the dis-  tance between jezirah tarif* (tarifa) and kasr masmiidah* (alcasar), near  ceuta\n",
      " between these two last mentioned places there was once a bridge,  which, according to common opinion, iskhander (alexander) ordered to be built\n",
      "that he might pass from andalus into the opposite land of africa\n",
      " but of this  more will be said in the course of this narrative\n",
      "he narrow sea thus emergmg from between the two coasts was called  bahru-z-sokdk™ (the narrow sea)\n",
      " although the distance between the two  shores is so small, as we have already observed, this strait is nevertheless  very difficult to be passed, owing to the continual agitation of its waves, and  the frightful whirlpools occasioned by the meeting of the two seas\n",
      " we have  said that the width of the straits at the narrowest part was eighteen miles ; it  is double that width at ceuta, and from thence the sea begins to grow wider  and wider, until at some places it reaches 800 miles in breadth, or perhaps  more ; as happens at stir (tyre), on the coast of syria\n",
      " this sea contains  many islands, which some geographers estimate to be twenty-eight in number,  and of which the principal are sicily, malta, sardinia, corsica, crete, corfu, and  so forth\n",
      "he dimensions of the country are differently stated: al-mes’idi,” in his  “« golden meadows,” says, ‘‘ andalus is very thickly peopled ; nearly two months  ‘of continual marching are required to traverse it from one end to the other\n",
      "  “tt contains nearly forty cities of the first rank\n",
      "” ibn alisa’ *® agrees with  al-mes’idi in this particular ; his opinion is that the length of andalus from  ariénah ® (narbonne) to ishbénah (lisbon) is equal to the distance that a horse-  man well mounted may travel in sixty days; but this is decidedly an error, first  of all because narbonne is, by that author, placed within the limits of andalus,  while it is evident that it belongs to another country; and secondly, because the  distance between those two cities is much overrated, as most of the authors who  have written on the subject estimate it at only one month and a half’s march\n",
      "bnu sa’id, however, endeavours to adjust the difference by supposing that  tbn alisa’ meant a horseman not well mounted, and travelling by short stages,  and that his text was vitiated by the copyist\n",
      " he himself adopts the computation  of the sherif idrisi as that which deserves more credit, namely, that the length  of andalus is of one month’s march\n",
      " the same opinion is followed by al-hijéri,°  who, having, as he informs us, consulted with well informed and trustworthy  travellers on the subject, learnt from them that a little more than a month’s  good travelling was sufficient to traverse andalus in its whole length\n",
      "he last mentioned author (al-hijéri) estimates the distance from lisbon to  al-hdjiz*' (the pyrenees) at more than one thousand miles, but whoever wishes  to obtain more information on the subject may consult ibnu sa’id, who has  treated the matter at full length\n",
      "the width of andalus measured at the top, towards the north-east, is forty  miles, this being the length of those mountain barriers which separate it from  the country of the franks, and which stretch along from the mediterranean to  the ocean ; if measured at the centre, as for instance drawing a line to pass by  toledo, it is sixteen days’ march\n",
      "ts shape, according to all accounts, is that of a triangle; much difference, shape\n",
      "  however, exists among geographers respecting its north-eastern*? angle, namely,  that which falls in the neighbourhood of narbonne: some authors, like ahmed  ibn mohammed ar-rézi and ibnu hayyén, placing it in narbonne, a city imme-  diately facing bordhil (bourdeaux)** on the north-east ; while others only place  it in the neighbouring districts\n",
      " but this, as well as other points concerning  the topography of andalus, has been decided by the sherif idrisi, an author  in whose accounts implicit reliance may be placed, not only because he traversed  that country in all directions, navigated its seas, and surveyed its coasts, but  also on account of the great knowledge he acquired in the science of geography\n",
      "he words of ar-r4zi on the subject are as follows: ‘‘ the shape of andalus  “is that of a triangle, the angles of which are placed, one at kadis (cadiz), where  “stands the famous tower with an idol at the top, or rather at that spot on the  “extreme south where the mediterranean begins, directing its course to the east\n",

      "ndalus was divided, following the words of ar-rézi, into two parts :—andalus  al-gharbé (western), and andalus ash-sharki (eastern), the division having been  made according to the prevailing winds, the fall of the rains, and the course of  the rivers\n",
      " the gharbi (western) was that part of andalus whose rivers empty  their waters into the western ocean, and where it rains when the winds blow  from the western quarter ; the sharkt (eastern), which was also called al-aksd,  or the remote, being, on the contrary, that whose rivers flow to the east, and  where it rains when the easterly winds blow\n",
      " the dividing line between these  two districts was placed by ar-r4zi in the mountains of the basques (al-bashkans)  towards the east, from thence drawing a line to the city of santa maria,** then  inclining a little towards the district of agreda, in the neighbourhood of toledo,  and at last approaching that part of the mediterranean which washes the shores of  the modern cartagena, which belongs to the district of lércah (lorca)\n",
      " all the  countries falling eastward of this line were therefore comprised within the limits  of eastern andalus, and those to the west within those of western andalus\n",
      " the  boundaries of the latter were: to the north-west, and west, the ocean; to the south  the western sea, whence the mediterranean, which the ancients called also  bahr tirren,® issues to take its course towards syria\n",

      "bi bekr ’abdullah ibn ’abdi-l-hakam, known by the surname of ibn an-  nadhdhém,\"' treating of the said division, adds a few particulars which we repeat  here for the sake of information\n",
      " ‘‘ andalus,” he says, ‘‘ was divided into two  “« parts by ancient geographers, who observed that whenever winds from the wes\n",
      "“ prevailed, it ‘rained much in western andalus, and there was drought in the  “ eastern; and, on the contrary, when the wind blew from the east, rain fell  “in abundance in the eastern, and the western was dry and parched\n",
      " the  “same difference was observed respecting the course of rivers, for all the rivers  “in western andalus flow from the east to the west, forcing their way through  “ those mountains *? that traverse it in the middle, and are only a branch detached  “from the mountains in the north-western districts\n",
      " in the eastern all rivers  “flow from west to east, for although some of them take a more southern  “ direction, yet they all spring from the said mountains in the centre of andalus,  “and discharge their waters into the mediterranean, which goes on to syria,  “and is known also by the name of bahru-r-rimi (the sea of greece)\n",
      " as to  “the rivers of the north-western districts** (al-juf), including those of the  “country of the galicians, and its dependencies, all empty themselves into the  ‘ preat ocean (atlantic), which washes the shores of those countries\n",
      "\n",
      "he same author (ibn an-nadhdhém) says that the first people who, after the first setters  deluge, settled in andalus, according to the accounts of foreign writers, were a ‘*\"\"\"\"*  nation called andalush, who gave their name to the country\n",
      " this word andalush  being in the course of time corrupted by the arabs, who changed the letter shin  into sin, it was written and pronounced andalus, which is the present name of  this country\n",
      "“ those barbarians came to andalus and settled in it; and their  numbers having increased considerably, in the course of time they filled the whole  country and established different kingdoms in it\n",
      " but being idolaters (majis), |  and otherwise inclined to depravity and corruption, they lived in entire disobedience :  to the divine precepts, until god almighty, perceiving their obstinacy, withdrew \\  the rain from them, and the whole country was thereby exposed to the most  dreadful sterility ; fountains sank into the bowels of the earth, rivers altered their  course, trees dried up, plants withered, and both men and beasts experienced  the most raging thirst, owing to which most of the inhabitants perished, with the  exception of a few who escaped from death by flying into distant lands\n",
      " thus  freed from these people, andalus became a desert, and continued so for one  hundred years,** for that great calamity was not confined to any part of its territory,  but ravaged the whole country from the pyrenees to the furthest extremity in the  western or green sea\n",

      "after making war against them until they were nearly exterminated, he caused  the few who remained to be embarked on board some vessels, and giving them  for commander an officer of the name of batrikus, he allowed them to go whither  they pleased\n",
      " batrikus and his men first cast anchor at a place on the western  shore of andalus, and settled at cadiz\n",
      " having afterwards advanced into the  interior of the country, they found that, owing to the fall of rain, the land had  recovered its former aspect, the fields were adorned with verdure, the rivers flowed,  the fountains ran, and the trees were covered with leaves\n",
      " encouraged by what  they saw, they proceeded still farther, spread themselves about the country,  extended their settlements, built cities and towns, and increased their numbers  by marriage\n",
      " however, they settled in preference in that part of the country  hetween the place of their landing in the west, and the country of the franks  in the east, and appointed kings to rule over them and administer their affairs\n",
      "  their religion was the same as that of their predecessors in the country, that is,  they worshipped idols\n",
      " they fixed their capital at talikah (italica), a city now  in ruins, and which once belonged to the district of ishbiliah (seville)\n",
      " but,  after a period of one hundred and fifty-seven years, during which eleven kings  of that race reigned over andalus, god almighty permitted that they should all  be annihilated by the barbarians of rome, who invaded and conquered the country\n",

      "  “* the africans made a most desperate resistance, and, the place being very strong,  ‘held out a considerable time, until ishban, impatient of the delay, caused the  “city of seville to be built opposite to italica, and, pressing on the siege, took it  “by storm\n",

      " we may add to it what a certain historian  says to prove the taking of jerusalem, although he attributes the conquest to  another king, namely, that most of the wonderful things which the moslems  found among the spoils of andalus at the time of the conquest, such as the  table of suleymén, son of datid, (upon whom be peace!) which térik ibn  zeyad found in a temple at toledo, and the pearl necklace taken by misa ibn  nosseyr from the church at merida, as well as a great many other precious objects  and jewels, of which a more ample description will be given hereafter, were part  of the share in the spoil which, at the taking of jerusalem by bokht nasser,  fell to the lot of a king of spain, whose name was beridn,** and who was present  at the conquest of that city\n",

      " this took place about the  time of the resurrection of the massih (anointed), son of mariim, (on whom be  peace!) they conquered the whole of andalus, and fixed their court at merida,  remaining in undisturbed possession of the country during the reign of twenty-  seven monarchs, until they themselves were subdued by the goths, who with  their king at their head invaded andalus, and separated it for ever from the  empire of rome\n",

      "  tbnu sa’id tells us, on the authority of his father, who was an eye-witness, that a  dispute once arose in presence of abi yahya ibn abi zakariyyé, lord of ceuta,  between abi yahya ibnu-l-mo’allem, a native of tangiers, and the sheikh  ash-shakandi of cordova, on the advantages of their respective countries, africa  and andalus, each claiming the superiority for the land of his birth: the con-  versation growing warmer, ash-shakandi said to his opponent, “‘ were it not for  ‘ andalus, africa, thy country, would never have been known, nor would\n",
      " its  “advantages, whatever they may be, have been justly appreciated, had not\n",
      " our  ‘historians and poets pointed to them in their writings: were i not afraid of  “ annoying the illustrious individuals in whose company we are, i would soon  ‘ prove to thee the truth of what i advance\n",
      "” ‘‘ by the lord,” exclaimed the  amir, who was lending an attentive ear to the arguments of the contending parties,  * go on, that is just what we want,” and his countenance was all of a sudden  illumined by the rays of vehement curiosity\n",
      " ibnu-l-mo’allem then replied—  “ dost thou really mean to say that excellency and power reside any where else  “but amongst us? prove it\n",
      "” ash-shakandi was on the point of undertaking  the defence of his country, when the amir interposed and said ‘‘ the subject is  “ too important to be treated thus extempore; let each of you retire, and com-  “ pose a risdleh (epistle) in praise of his own country; you may then treat the  “ subject at large, and i shall be enabled to decide between you\n",
      "” ash-shakandi  then produced the master-piece of eloquence and learning to which frequent  allusich will be made in the course of this narrative, and from which we borrow  the following \n",
      "praise be ascribed to god who permitted that there should be in andalus  “* people to take into their hands the praises of those who distinguished them-  “ selves ; him who makes lasting whatever he pleases, and who has no one to  ‘‘ oppose him, and no one to find fault with him; since who will call the day  “ darkness ? who will say ugly to a handsome face? i have found a subject  ‘‘ abundant with matter, since i have been endowed with a tongue to express and  “utter\n",
      " i praise him because he made me one of his creatures, because he chose  ‘me to be one of those who acknowledge and adore him, because he caused me  “to be sprung from a noble and illustrious race, because he gave me a mind t\n",
      "“admire and a tongue to praise the meritorious deeds, and the worthy qualities  “of my countrymen ; and i ask his blessing and favour for our lord mohammed,  ‘his illustrious messenger, and may god’s everlasting peace and salvation be on  “his family and companions—those of the good deeds and pure intentions \n",
      " but to proceed,—i have been stirred out of my tranquil state, and disturbed  “ out of my peace; i have been driven out of my pacific disposition to defence and  “contradiction by a disputer on the excellences of andalus, who wishes to separate  “what is joined, and that we should bring to him things which neither spectators  ‘‘ ever saw nor hearers ever heard of before, or if any did, they never transmitted  “their knowledge to us, since neither those who saw, nor those who heard, were  “authorized to do so\n",
      "\" he pretends to make africa superior to andalus, which  “is as much as to say that the left hand is better than the right, and that night  “is brighter than day; and, o wonder! he wishes to oppose glass beads to  “ inestimable pearls, and to put pebbles by the side of rubies, and low lands on a  “level with inaccessible mountains; he might as well blow on a hearth where  “there is no fire, or go a hunting provided with stones instead of hawks, as  “ presume to make great what god almighty created small, and to lead astray  “ what he decreed should be a guide\n",
      "where are thy wits gone? what is become of thy wisdom and penetration,  ‘‘ when the love of thy country has induced thee to extinguish both thy lights, that  “of thy eyes, and that of thy reason? as to thy expression ‘our sovereigns,’ i  ‘‘ must say that they are ours too, as can be proved by those words of a poet-\n",

      " for although it be true that the court of the west is now held in one of your  “ cities, owing to the khalifate being in the hands of the sulténs of the family of  ‘“abdu-l-mimen, (may god almighty perpetuate it in their hands!) we also  “ have had sulténs of the korayshite family, of whom an eastern poet has said\n",

      "’ !®  “for how many noble actions did they not furnish the historian with? how  many of their memorable sayings became the property of the poet, to drive  “both him and the historian to despair with the difficulty of the subject \n",
      " since man always leaves behind him some memorial ; and thine will be  ‘a real treasure for the collectors\n",
      "’ \n",
      " one of their greatest kings was al-mansiir ibn abi ’a’mir, of whom i shall  “merely mention to thee a few circumstances, for i know of no other moslem  “who, in his conquests of the christian territory, reached, sword in hand, to  “the very shores washed by the green sea, who did not leave in the infidel  ‘“‘ country a single moslem captive, who surpassed herkal (heraclius)'* in the  “number of his armies, iskhander (alexander) in prudence and military talents,  “and upon whose tomb, when his doom was decreed, the following verses were  “ engraved \n",
      "the traces he left behind will tell thee who he was, as if thou sawest  ‘him with thy own eyes\n",

      "* more praises have been sung of this al-manstr, and more books have been  “ dedicated to him, than is easy for me to enumerate and inform thee of, so  ‘‘much so that the fame of his name reached as far as baghd4d, and the most  “remote corners of the globe were filled with the report of his good and bad  “* qualities\n",
      "‘ however, when, after the breaking of the necklace and the scattering of it\n",
      "“ pearls, the kings of small states divided among themselves the patrimony  “of the beni umeyyah, the cause of science and literature, instead of losing\n",
      "gained considerably by the division, since every one of the usurpers disputed  “with each other the prize of prose and poetical composition, and overstocked  “ their markets with all departments of science ; encouraged literature, and treated  “the learned with distinction, rewarding them munificently for their labours :  “their principal boast was to have people say, the learned man such a one is  “held in great esteem by the king so and so—or the poet such a one is much  “beloved by the king so and so; so that not one is to be found among them  ‘‘who has not been distinguished by the most brilliant qualities, or who has  “not left behind him traces that the hand of time will never obliterate, and  “which will be transmitted to future generations in the writings of orators and  “poets\n",
      " such, i am told, was the case with the sclavonian eunuchs of al-  “manstr, who rose in their governments after his death, such as mujéhid,  “ mundher, and khayran, not to mention the arab sovereigns of the dynasties  “of beni abbdd, beni somddeh, beni al-afttas, beni dhi-l-niin,?) beni hid,  “all of whom were so much praised and extolled by poets, that had the same  “praises been bestowed on night she would have become lighter even than  “day; and the poets never ceased presenting each other with the offerings of  “the sweet-scented gales playing among the flowers, and making upon their  “treasures the attacks of al-barddh,” until their ambition grew such that one  “of their poets swore that he would not praise a king in a kasstdeh under  “one hundred dinars, and al-mu’atamed ibn ’abbdd, having heard of it, sent  “for him and ordered him to write one, and used all sorts of persuasion to  “induce him to do it, but he obstinately refused to comply with his wishes  “unless he agreed to give him the sum he asked, it being worthy of remark  “that al-mu’atamed was not only the most powerful sovereign of his time,  “but one who could bear the least opposition on the part of a subject\n",
      " one of the greatest acts of generosity that ever a monarch performed towards  “a subject appears in the following anecdote, which is a further illustration of  “what i have advanced\n",
      " it is related that abi ghalib,* the philologist, having  “once written a very fine work, mujdhid al-’émiri, who was then king of  “denia, sent him as a present one thousand dinars, a horse, and a rich suit  “of dress, requesting him at the same time to say that the work had been  “written by his orders\n",
      "* this, however, abii ghalib refused to do, and, sending  “back the present, he gave the following answer—‘ this book i wrote merely  “for the use of the public, and in order that my name might be handed down  “to posterity ; were i to put at the head of it any other name but mine, al\n",
      "“‘the honour would be his\n",
      " no, i will not consent to it\n",
      "’ when this answer  “* was brought to mujahid, instead of being offended, he was much gratified and  ‘* astonished to see the high temper of his soul, and his courage and determination ;  “‘ he returned him the presents, and said—‘ he might at any rate have mentioned  “ me in his book ; this is a thing happening every day ; however, i shall not insist  “any longer\n",
      "’ \n",
      " but it being a notorious fact that all the kings of andalus known by the name  “of ‘ kings of small states’ vied with each other in filling their capitals with  “learned men and poets, and encouraging by their unusual profuseness all the  “‘ branches of literature, i shall not stop to detail their actions\n",
      " i shall merely  ‘“‘ remind thee of the princes of the illustrious dynasty of the beni ’abbdd, with  ““ whom, as god almighty has said in his kordn, reside fruit, palm, and pome-  “ granate, under whose reign every day was a solemn festivity, and who showed  ‘a greater passion for literature than was ever shown by the beni hamdan in  “« aleppo,” and who became, together with their sons, relatives and wizirs, the centre  “ of eloquence both in prose and in verse, labouring assiduously and unanimously  ‘in the various departments of science ; who left behind them brilliant traces, and  “ everlasting fame, and whose history abounds in generous actions and noble deeds  “ that will last through succeeding ages, and live for ever in the memory of man\n",
      "  ‘* and if what i advance be not true, by allah, do tell me the names of countrymen  “of yours who have distinguished themselves in any path whatever before the  “establishment of the present muhadite dynasty\n",
      " dost thou mean sakmit the  “« hajib,* or sdleh al-baraghwatti? ?” or perhaps ytsef ibn tashfin, who, if he  ‘* acquired any fame, owed it merely to his connexion with ibn ’abbdd, who, being  “ the centre of the poets of his time, and the target to which they directed their  ‘« praises and their verses, whenever they treated about him the name of ytisef was_  “necessarily introduced ; otherwise, i ask you, would he have been known, an  “ ignorant and rude beydawi as he was? and if not, i will relate to thee the words  “ which they attribute- to him\n",
      " they say that al-mu’atamed ibn ’abb4d asked  ‘* yuisef once, ‘o prince of the moslems! dost thou know what these poets say ?’  “« «no, by my soul,’ said yuisef, “ unless it be that they ask for bread\n",
      "’ but what  “ t am going to state proves still more his ignorance: when yusef, some time after  “ this, parted from al-mu’atamed, and retired to his capital in africa, the latter  “‘ wrote him an epistle, in which was the following distich \n",
      " thou art gone, and my sides shake for want of thee, and the water of our  ‘ desert has dried up\n",
      " thy departure has changed our days into nights, the obscurity of which  ‘ only thy presence can dissipate\n",
      "’ \n",
      "“ when these verses were read to yiisef, he exclaimed, ‘ what does he ask for ?  “ does he not say he wants us to send him black and white slave girls ?\n",
      "no, o master!’ replied the reader; ‘he only means to say that his night  “ becomes a day at the approach of the prince of the moslems; since the nights  “ spent in pleasure are called white, and those passed in affliction and sorrow black\n",
      "  “ thus he expects that with thy return day will again dawn for him\n",
      "’ ‘very well,’  “replied yuisef, ‘ answer him that our tears are dropping for his sake, and that our  “ heads are aching for love of him\n",
      "’ such was yiisef’s answer ; and would to god  “that al-’abbds ibnu-l-ahk4f® were living, in order that he might have learnt  “from him to show tenderness of love\n",

      "“cordova may be properly called the military camp of andalus, since it was  “at one time the common meeting-place of those splendid armies which, with  “the help of god, defeated at every encounter the worshippers of the crucified\n",
      "  “tt is said of al-manstir ibn abi ’a’mir, that when his authority had been  “ firmly established both in andalus and in africa, and his armies and treasures  “had been considerably increased, he held a general review of his troops previous  “to an incursion which he meditated into the enemy’s territory (which was carried  “into effect, and the country subdued)\n",
      " the number of troops which, from the  “various provinces of the empire, assembled on the outskirts of cordova on this  “memorable occasion is generally stated at 600,000 foot, and 200,000 horse\n",

      " t have heard also of its famous mosque, which was lighted with bronze lamps  “ made out of christian bells ; and of the great addition made to it by al-mansir,  “which was entirely built with the materials of demolished churches brought  “to cordova on the heads of christian captives\n",
      "t have heard it said that the cities of cordova, az-zahraé and az-zéhirah,  “together covered at one time a piece of ground measuring ten miles in length,  “which distance might be traversed at night by the light of lamps, placed close  “one to another\n",

      " i have heard of its canbdéniyah®® (meadow), and  “of the great fertility with which god almighty has endowed the earth of its  “districts, and the abundance and good quality of grain and other agricultural  “ productions which it yields every year\n",
      "every one who has been in cordova must have heard of the mountains called  “ jebalu-l-warad (the mountains of the rose), owing to the innumerable rose trees  “that grow on them\n",
      " indeed their numbers are so surprising, that although a  “roba (five-and-twenty pounds weight)® of rose leaves will at times fetch at  “cordova four dirhems, or perhaps more, which makes it a great source of  “revenue to proprietors, yet no one prevents the people from plucking them on  “his grounds\n",
      "the guadalquivir at cordova is by no means so fine a stream as it is at  “seville, yet its waters are sweeter, and there is not so much danger of bein\n",
      "‘drowned ; its banks are besides more pleasant, being covered with orchards,  ‘* plantations, and pastures, which enliven the eyes of the spectators, and have the  “* most brilliant effect\n",

      "he character of the cordovans is thus described by ibnu sa’id\n",

      " the author of the minhdju-l-fakar™ (open way to reflection) concur\n",
      "in the latter opinion, but the former is the most common; besides, the opinions  of these authors may be easily reconciled, for ibnu malik ar-ro’ayni says that the  people of damascus were sent thither on account of the similitude the country  around elvira bore to the place of their birth, and thus both the above-mentioned  circumstances might be pointed out as having led to the origin of its name\n",

      " the inhabitants are endowed with the gift of  poetry, and great love for the sciences ; the poet abt-l-hasan ibn nasr,” describing  this city, gives the following verses in praise of its river\n",

      "he city of malakah (malaga) is another of the great capitals comprised in this  division ; we shall describe it in the words of ash-shakandi, the author to whom  frequent allusion has been already made in the course of this work\n",
      " ‘ malaga,”  he says, “unites land and sea prospects, thus partaking of the advantages and  “ productions of both; its environs are so covered with vines and orchards as to  ‘“‘ make it almost impossible for the traveller to discover a piece of ground which  “is not cultivated\n",

      " but what ranks malaga  “ far above any other country in the world is its figs called ar-rayt, from rayah,'”  “ which was the ancient name of the city; i was told that they may be procured  ‘in baghdad, where they are considered as the greatest delicacy, and as to the  ‘* quantity annually exported by sea both in moslem and christian vessels, it is  “so enormous that i shall not venture upon a computation, for fear of falling shor\n",
      "“of the real number\n",
      " during my residence in that city i once travelled along  “the sea coast from sohayl to tish,’ a distance of three days’ march, and i  “declare i saw nothing else on the road but fig trees, whose branches, loaded  “with fruit, almost touched the ground, so that the little urchins of the villages  “plucked them without the least trouble, besides the great numbers that were  “ scattered on the ground\n",
      " those of tish are reckoned to be the best; it was  “of one of these figs that a berber said, when he was asked how he liked it,  “thou askest me how i like it, and it has all melted down my throat,’ and, by  “ allah, the berber was right, for i never tasted better figs in my life, and  “ besides they are a blessing which god has refused to his country (africa)\n",
      " another of the peculiarities of malaga is the fabric of allowed and forbidden  “liquors, that called ‘malaga wine’ having become proverbial\n",

      " to the east, on the sea shore, is the city of belesh (velez),  which very much resembles malaga in the abundance and good quality of its  fruits ; farther on, on the coast, is nerjah (nerja),\"\"° which ibnu sa’id describes as  avery large town, almost resembling a city in size, surrounded by orchards and  gardens, and with a river so pleasant that it tempts the traveller to halt on its  banks\n",
      " another fine town depending upon malaga is that of al-hamah '  (alhama), where there are springs of hot water close to the banks of the river\n",
      "  but let us pass to the description of almeria\n",
      "l-meriyah (almeria) is situate at the bottom of a deep valley formed by two  mountains, on one of which stands the famous castle of kheyran, so well known  by its strength\n",
      " this castle was built during the khalifate of ’abdu-r-rahmén  an-nassir, but was afterwards considerably improved and enlarged by kheyrdn \"!?  the sclavonian, a freedman of al-mansir ibn abi ’a’mir, who, having usurped  the royal power, appointed his friends and adherents to the government of the  principal cities, and gave to this kheyrdn that of almeria, where, during the  civil war which followed the death of al-mansiir, he declared himself independent\n",
      "  the castle was named after him\n",
      " on the other mountain is built one of the  suburbs, which, together with the city, is enclosed within very strong walls\n",
      "  almeria, on the whole, is a very strong place, for besides its fortifications, and  the high towers that surround it on every side, the city is as it were enclosed  within a natural barrier formed by immense primitive rocks, as sharp and naked  as if they had been passed through a sieve\n",
      "all authors agree in saying that the inhabitants of almeria were at one time  the wealthiest people in all andalus, and those who carried on the most extensive  trade, owing to which the population is said to have been very considerable, and  the number of public baths and inns to have gmounted to no less than one  thousand, without counting those of its western suburb, called rabadhu-l-haus  (the suburb of the cistern), which was also amply provided with inns, markets,  public baths, and manufactures of all kinds\n",
      "he river, which is the same as at berja,'! also contributes no little to the  ornament of the city and its environs, for out of the one hundred and twenty  miles which make up the length of its course, the last forty, before reaching the  sea, are through orchards, gardens, and groves, where the singing birds delight  with their harmony the ears of the traveller\n",
      "e find in a certain author that one of the gates of almeria was called  bébu-l-’okdb (the gate of the eagle), owing toa figure of this bird which stood  on the top of it from times of old, and was beautiful to behold\n",
      " this, however,  was not the only ancient relic to be found in the city, for it abounded in old  remains of buildings, and all along the coast might be seen wonderful palaces  and other stupendous structures of the ancient kings of the country\n",
      "here was in almeria a dock-yard™* where very fine vessels were built; the  coast was safe and well frequented\n",

      "  elsewhere (following the words of ibn an-naththém) that it was founded by  ishbin, king of the romans\n",
      " however, the building of this city is by others  attributed to another king of the romans whose name was julius, and who was  the first to take the title or appellation of kaysar (cxsar)\n",
      " which of the two was  its real founder we are unable to determine\n",
      " they say that when-cesar came to  andalus, and saw the spot which is now occupied by seville, he was very much  struck with the beauty, extent, and apparent fertility of the country all around  him; that he was also very much pleased with the luxuriance and fine vegetation  of the mountainous district (now) called asharaf (axarafe), and therefore deter-  mined upon building a city in that spot\n",
      " having chosen a convenient situation  on the banks of the wddi-l-’adhem (guadalquivir),! he began the building of his  city, which he surrounded with strong stone walls, and in the certre of which he  erected two citadels of wonderful structure, which he named al-akhdwin (the two  ‘sisters)\n",
      "2 kaysar, moreover, fixed his residence in his new city, which became thus _  the capital of his kingdom, and was known ever after by the name of juliah-  romtyah,> which its founder gave to it, being a compound of his own name  (julius) and that of his native country (romah)\n",
      "eville, as we have already remarked, became also the capital of andalus during  the gothic domination, for the kings of this race used to divide their court between  four principal cities, viz\n",
      " seville, cordova, carmona, and toledo; and to reside in  one of these four cities, according to the different seasons of the year\n",
      "ne of the authors who has described seville expresses himself in the following  terms :—‘ seville is built on the banks of the guadalquivir, also known by the  “name of wddi kortubah (the river of cordova)\n",

      "as also with articles of trade of the most expensive  ‘* kind, which afford great gain to the merchants\n",
      " the people of seville are said  ‘* to be wealthy ; their principal traffic consists in their oils, which they ship to  ‘« distant parts of the east and west\n",
      " the olive tree grows very luxuriantly in all  ‘* the districts dependent on the city, but above all, in that called axarafe,® which  “ is an extensive tract of land measuring about forty miles in length, and nearly  “as much in width, formed of gentle hills of a reddish earth, and where there are  “* forests of olive and fig trees planted so thickly as to afford the passengers who  “ travel through them a complete shelter in the hottest summer day\n",
      " the axarafe  “ contains besides a very large population scattered in farm houses, or living in  “towns and villages, which have also their market-places, their baths,—fine  ‘* buildings, and other conveniences and comforts only to be met with in cities  ‘* of the first order\n",
      "\n",
      "he author of the minhdju-l-fakar (open way to reflection) says that seville  was one of the handsomest cities in the world, and its inhabitants famous for their  indolent habits, and their love of pleasure, which in them was almost proverbial\n",
      "  they led a most luxurious and dissipated life, which, the author observes, “‘ was  “ chiefly owing to the delightful river that flows through their territory, and which  ‘* has not its equal in the world\n",
      " it is navigable for large vessels, and is always  ‘ filled with pleasure-boats kept by the inhabitants, and by fishing or trading  “ vessels : in the opinion of some it surpasses in beauty the euphrates, the tigris,  “ and the nile\n",
      " its banks are covered with fruit trees, forming a sort of canopy  “ over the river, so that one may sail in it sheltered from the rays of the sun, and  “listening to the charming melody of the singing birds\n",
      " the journey along its  _ banks is equally pleasant, and one may travel the distance of ten parasangs-  “« (thirty miles) through clusters of buildings and farm houses, high towers and  “ strong castles, forming a continued city\n",
      " the tide is perceptible in the river of  “ seville at a distance of seventy-two miles from the sea\n",

      "eville and its territory was also known by the name of hems (emesa), as we  have said elsewhere ; for when the lands of andalus were divided among the arab  settlers it fell to the lot of the people of emesa in syria, whose banner imme-  diately follows that of the people of damascus in the processions at medina\n",
      "arious are the works of art and splendid buildings described by the author\n",

      " as a piece of architecture it is unparalleled in the world\n",
      " ibnu sa’id  mentions also several spots in the vicinity of seville to which the inhabitants used  to resort for the sake of recreation and indulgence ; one was tarayanah (triana) ,°  one of the suburbs attached to the city, the other kabtdi,’ an island on the  guadalquivir\n",

      " this latter requisite indeed gave rise to that saying, so common  “among the people of andalus—‘ if thou seekest for birds’ milk, by allah thou  “shalt find it in seville\n",

      " i also asked a traveller who had resided in  “ baghdad, and he gave me a similar answer about the tigris: in fact, the  ‘‘ guadalquivir can only be compared to a paradise, for not only are the districts  “‘ watered by it the most\n",
      "delightful regions that can be imagined, but the inhabitant\n",
      "the compiler of the travels of ibnu battiéttah, who quotes the preceding verses,  attributes the first to the preacher abi mohammed ’abdu-l-wahhab, a native of  malaga ; the second he gives as the composition of the kadi abi ’abdillah ibn  *abdi-l-malik, but god only knows\n",
      "he said ibnu battittah, or rather the editor of his travels, describes this city  in the following terms: ‘“ malaga,” he says, ‘is one of the principal cities of  “ andalus; it has an excellent territory, and abounds in fruits of all sorts; i  “saw once eight ratl'’ of grapes sold in its market for one small dirhem; the  “celebrated pomegranate named al-murst, and another kind called al-yacétt (the  “‘ ruby-coloured), grow on its soil; figs and almonds form a considerable staple  “of trade, and are exported in great quantities to distant countries in the east  “and west, as also its golden pottery, which is quite wonderful\n",
      " it has a  “large mosque, jdémi’, very much renowned for its sanctity, with a very fine  * open court, all planted with beautiful orange trees\n",
      "\n",
      "o the west of malaga lies an extensive district which comprises many towns  and villages, and is known by the name of sohayl,'® owing to a certain mountain  there, which is said to be the only spot in andalus from whence the star sohayl  (canopus) is visible\n",
      " to the east, on the sea shore, is the city of belesh'® (velez),  which very much resembles malaga in the abundance and good quality of its  fruits ; farther on, on the coast, is nerjah (nerja),''!° which ibnu sa’id describes as  avery large town, almost resembling a city in size, surrounded by orchards and  gardens, and with a river so pleasant that it tempts the traveller to halt on its  banks\n",
      " another fine town depending upon malaga is that of al-hamah '  (alhama), where there are springs of hot water close to the banks of the river\n",
      "  but let us pass to the description of almeria\n",
      "l-meriyah (almeria) is situate at the bottom of a deep valley formed by two  mountains, on one of which stands the famous castle of kheyran, so well known  by its strength\n",
      " this castle was built during the khalifate of ’abdu-r-rahman  an-nassir, but was afterwards considerably improved and enlarged by kheyran '!?  the sclavonian, a freedman of al-mansir ibn abi ’a’mir, who, having usurped  the royal power, appointed his friends and adherents to the government of the  principal cities, and gave to this kheyrdn that of almeria, where, during the  civil war which followed the death of al-manstr, he declared himself independent\n",
      "  the castle was named after him\n",
      " on the other mountain is built one of the  suburbs, which, together with the city, is enclosed within very strong walls\n",
      "  almeria, on the whole, is a very strong place, for besides its fortifications, and  the high towers that surround it on every side, the city is as it were enclosed  within a natural barrier formed by immense primitive rocks, as sharp and naked  as if they had been passed through a sieve\n",
      "all authors agree in saying that the inhabitants of almeria were at one time  the wealthiest people in all andalus, and those who carried on the most extensive  trade, owing to which the population is said to have been very considerable, and  the number of public baths and inns to have amounted to no less than one  thousand, without counting those of its western suburb, called rabadhu-l-haus  (the suburb of the cistern), which was also amply provided with inns, markets,  public baths, and manufactures of all kinds\n",
      "he river, which is the same as at berja,° also contributes no little to the  ornament of the city and its environs, for out of the one hundred and twenty  miles which make up the length of its course, the last forty, before reaching the  sea, are through orchards, gardens, and groves, where the singing birds delight  with their harmony the ears of the traveller\n",
      "e find in a certain author that one of the gates of almeria was called  badbu-l-’okdb (the gate of the eagle), owing to a figure of this bird which stood  on the top of it from times of old, and was beautiful to behold\n",
      " this, however,  was not the only ancient relic to be found in the city, for it abounded in old  remains of buildings, and all along the coast might be seen wonderful palaces  and other stupendous structures of the ancient kings of the country\n",
      "here was in almeria a dock-yard * where very fine vessels were built; the  coast was safe and well frequented\n",

      " it is notorious that so long as the idol on the tower at cadiz stood,  ‘it prevented the winds from blowing across the straits into the ocean, so that no  “ large vessels could sail from the mediterranean into the ocean, or vice versa ;  “but, on the contrary, when it was pulled down in the first years of the reign of  “the beni ’abd-al-mimen, the spell was broken, and vessels of all descriptions  ‘began to furrow the sea with impunity\n",

      "his idol, in the opinion of some writers, held some keys in his right hand, but  the contrary has been proved by the author of the ja’raflyah, as we shall have  further occasion to show\n",
      " it is also stated, that according to an ancient tradition  the belief prevailed all over andalus that underneath the idol an immense treasure  lay concealed from times of old: that the tradition existed no doubt can be enter-  tained, since various writers, who saw this idol, agree in saying that when ’ali  tbn misa,’ nephew of the k4id abi ’abdillah, who held the charge of admiral  of the sea, revolted, and declared himself independent at cadiz, he caused th\n",
      "idol to be pulled down, and a search to be made for the supposed treasures,  but that nothing was found\n",

      " we shall quote his own words\n",
      " ‘in this city,” he says,  (meaning cadiz) ‘‘ there formerly stood a square tower, upwards of one hundred  “ cubits high, and built of large blocks of stone, admirably placed one on the  “top of another, and fastened together by hooks of brass\n",
      " on the top of the  “ tower was a square pedestal of white marble, measuring four spans,® and on it a  “ statue representing a human being, so admirably executed in form, proportions,  “and face, that it looked more like a living man than an inanimate block\n",
      " his  “ face was turned towards the western sea; he had his back to the north;?  “‘ the left arm extended, and the fingers closed, with the exception of the fore-  “* finger, which he held in a horizontal position, pointing towards the mouth of  “‘ that sea which issues out of the ocean, and lies between tangiers and tarifa,  “being known by the name of bahru-z-zokék (the straits of gibraltar)\n",
      " his  “right arm was close to the body, as if holding his garments tightly, and in  “the right hand he bore a stick, with which he pointed towards the sea\n",
      " some  “authors pretend that what he held were keys, but it is a mis-statement; i  “‘ saw the idol often, and could never discover any thing else but the above-  “ mentioned stick, which he held in his right hand in a vertical position, and  “‘ somewhat raised from the ground; besides, i am assured by the testimony of  “ trustworthy people, who were present or assisted at the pulling down of thi\n",
      "“idol, that it was a short stick, of about twelve spans in length, having at the  “end some teeth like a curry-comb\n",
      " who was the builder of this tower, with  “the idol on the top, does not sufficiently appear\n",
      " mes’idi, in his ‘ golden  “ meadows,’ ® attributes its construction to al-jabbdr,® the same who built the  “ seven idols in the country of zinj, which are one in sight of the other: but  “the most probable opinion seems to be that it was built by some of the ancient  “ kings of andalus to serve as a guide to navigators, from the fact of the idol  “ having his left arm extended towards the bahru-z-zok4k (straits), and pointing  “to the mouth, as if he was showing the way\n",
      " there were not wanting people  “who thought this idol to be made of pure gold; for whenever the rising or  “ setting sun fell on the statue it sent forth rays of light, and shone in the  “ brightest hues, like the collar of a ring-dove, blue being the colour which  “ prevailed\n",
      " thus placed on the top of the tower the idol was like a signal for  “ the moslem navigators to go in and out of the ocean, and whoever wanted to  “ sail from any port in the mediterranean to places in al-maghreb, such as lisbon,  ‘and others, had only to approach the tower, and then put up the sails, and  “make for the port whither they wished to go, whether salé, anfa, or any  “ other in the western coast of africa\n",
      " when in after times this idol was pulled  “ down, it ceased of course to be a signal for navigators: its demolition happened  “thus\n",
      " in the year 540 (a\n",
      " d\n",
      " 1145-6), at the beginning of the second civil war,  “ *ali tbn isa ibn maymin,\"” who was admiral of the fleet, revolted at cadiz, and  “ declared himself independent\n",
      " having heard the inhabitants say that the idol on  “« the top of the tower was made of pure gold, his cupidity was raised, and he gave  “ orders for its immediate removal\n",
      " the statue was accordingly brought down by  “ dint of great exertions, and when on the ground was found to be made of brass,  “ covered only with a thin coat of gold, which, when removed, produced twelve  “ thousand gold dinars\n",
      " it is a general opinion among andalusian and african  “moslems that this idol exercised a sort of spell over the sea, but that the charm  “ ceased the moment it was thrown down\n",
      " they account for it in the following  “‘manner\n",
      " there used once to be in the ocean some large vessels which the  “ andalusians call kardkir,'? provided with a square sail in front, and another  “behind; they were manned by a nation called majis, people of great strength,  “ determination, arfd much practice in navigation, and who at their landing on the  “coasts destroyed every thing with fire and sword, and committed unheard-of  “ ravages and cruelties, so that at their appearance the inhabitants fled with their  “ valuables to the mountains, and the whole coast was depopulated\n",
      " the in-  ‘“ vasions of these barbarians were periodical—they took place every six or seven  “ years ; the number of their vessels was never less than forty, it sometime\n",
      "“ amounted to a hundred ; \"3 they devoured any one they found on the sea\n",
      " the  ‘tower that i have described was known to them, and, following the direction  ‘‘ pointed at by the idol, they were enabled to make at all times for the mouth  ‘‘ of the straits, and enter the mediterranean, ravage the coasts of andalus, and  “the islands close to it, sometimes carrying their depredations as far as the coasts  ‘‘ of syria\n",
      " but when the idol was destroyed by the command of ’ali ibn maymin,  ‘“‘as i have already stated, no more was heard of these people, nor were their  ‘* kardkir (vessels) seen in these seas, with the exception of two that were wrecked  “ on the coast, one at mersu-l-majis (the port of the majis),* and the other close  “ to the promontory of al-aghar\n",
      "\n",
      "mong the wonders of andalus one is the pit of kabrah (cabra), which, in the  opinion of ar-razi, who mentions it, is one of the gates of the winds\n",
      " it is to be  seen at some distance from cabra,'* and whatever efforts have been made to find  the bottom of it have proved ineffectual\n",
      "bnu sa’id also mentions a mountain in the neighbourhood of kal’atu-aurdd '®  where, says he, is a rock with a wide gap, and within it an iron pot hanging by a  chain\n",
      " whoever goes to the spot will see it, his hands will touch it, but all his  attempts to take it out will be fruitless; for no sooner will his hands come in  contact with it than the pot will sink in the cavity of the rock and disappear ;  however, if the person desists from his undertaking it will return to its former  position\n",
      " this is related by ibnu sa’id on the authority of ibnu bashkiwal, who,  among some ancient traditions, and other wonderful stories, concerning andalus,  mentions the following \n",
      " tt has been related to us on the authority of a traditionist, who had it from  “ seyf, that ‘othman ibn ’affan said ‘ that the conquest of constantiniyeh (con-  “ stantinople) would be made from andalus\n",

      "” such is the tradition; but let the responsibility of it lie on its  preservers, for as to us, we wish to be considered entirely pure and free from  it; for although it be true that it has been adopted and repeated by ibnu bash-  kiwél, by ibnu sa’id, and other respectable writers, yet we cannot give credit to  it, for it is not only improbable, but entirely devoid of foundation\n",

      " this phenomenon, which ibnu sa’id relates on the  authority of people who are said to have witnessed it, is nothing more than  the effects of light on an olive tree of the common species, as the author of  the ja’raftyah tells us\n",

      "minutely two water-clocks which abi-l-kasim ibn ’abdi-r-rahman, known by  the surname of az-zark4l,'® built in toledo, when he heard of the famous talisman  which is in the city of arin in india, and which mes’idi describes as marking  the time with a hand from sunset to sunrise\n",
      " these clocks consisted of two  basins, which filled with water or emptied according to the increasing or waning  of the moon\n",
      " az-zark4l placed them in a house out of the city, to the south-  west, and on the banks of the river tajoh (tagus), near to the spot called bdbu-i-  vol\n",

      "dabbdghin'® (the gate of the tanners); their action was as follows\n",
      " at the  moment when the new moon appeared on the horizon water began to flow into  the basins by means of subterranean pipes, so that there would be at day-break  the fourth of a seventh part, and at the end of the day half,a seventh part, of  the water required to fill the basins\n",
      " in this proportion the water would  continue to flow until seven days and as many nights of the month were  elapsed, when both basins would be half filled; the same process during the  following seven days and nights would make the two basins quite full, at the  same time that the moon was at its full\n",
      " however, on the fifteenth night  of the month, when the moon began to wane, the basins would also begin to  lose every day and night half a seventh part of their water, until by the twenty-  first of the month they would be half empty, and when the moon reached her  twenty-ninth night not a drop of water would remain in them; it being worthy  of remark that, should any one go to any of the basins when they were not  filled, and pour water into them with a view to quicken its filling, the basins  would immediately absorb the additional water, and retain no more than the  just quantity ; and, on the contrary, were any one to try, when they were nearly  filled, to extract any or the whole of their water, the moment he raised his  hands from the work the basins would pour out sufficient water to fill the  vacuum in an instant\n",
      " these clocks were undoubtedly a greater work of science  than the indian talisman, for this latter is placed in a country under the equinoctial  line, where the days and nights are of the same length, while in andalus, which  is in the temperate zone, it does not happen thus\n",
      " they remained for a long  time in toledo, until that city was taken by the christians, (may god send  confusion amongst them!) when the tyrant al-fonsh™® (alfonso) felt a great  curiosity to know how they were regulated, and caused one of them to be  excavated, which being done the interior machinery was damaged, and the  water ceased to flow into the basins\n",

      " this accursed jew, being anxious to discover the motion of  the clocks, said once to alfonso, ‘‘o king! were i to look at them in  “the inside, and see how they are made, not only could i restore them to  * their ancient state, but even construct two others still more wonderful, and  “‘which would fill during the day and empty at night\n",

      "anecdotes respecting andalus—population—productions of the soil\n",

      "e have also read that the said sultan and the africans who formed his court  were very much struck with the beauty of the prospect, the fertility of the land, the  abundance of provisions, the mildness of the temperature, the magnificence of its  buildings, and other advantages which make andalus superior to any other  country in the world, and that their admiration gave rise to many witty ex-  pressions and curious anecdotes in which the african histories abound ; but  unluckily the work in which we have read these and other particulars is not in our  possession, as we have left it with the remainder of our library in the al-maghreb  (west), so we must content ourselves with quoting that which we know by heart,  and fill up the deficiency with such works as we have been able to procure in  this country\n",
      "bnu sa’id, the author of the book entitled al-mugh’rab ft holt-l-maghreb? (the  eloquent speaker on the ornamental beauties of the west), a work which we have had  frequent occasion to quote, and which has been of the greatest assistance to us, when  describing at large the population and agricultural resources of andalus expresses  himself in the following terms\n",
      " ‘‘ were i called upon to give an adequate and just  “description of andalus, i would say that it is a country surrounded by sea,  “ abounding in fruits and productions of all kinds, full of cities and towns, and s\n",
      "“ thickly populated that if a traveller goes any distance through it he will find at  “ every step on his road hamlets, towns, farms, orchards, and cultivated fields, and  “ will never meet, as is more or less the case in other countries, with large tracts  “ of uncultivated land, or desert\n",
      " this, united to the habits of the andalusians,  “who, instead of living together, as the egyptians do, grouped in towns and  “ villages, prefer dwelling in cottages and rural establishments in the midst of  “the fields, by the side of brooks, and on the declivities of mountains, gives  “altogether to the country an aspect of comfort and prosperity which the tra-  “ veller will look for in vain elsewhere; their houses too, which they are  “ continually white-washing inside and out, look exceedingly well by the side of  “the green trees, and, to use the words of the famous wizir and poet ibnu-l-  “ himarah* in his description of andalus\n",
      " its hamlets brightening among the trees look like so many pearls set i\n",
      " and he was right, for if thou goest to egypt after having staid any length of  “time in andalus, thou wilt be surprised to see the wretched appearance of the  “ egyptian villages, placed as they are at great distances one from another, with  “ their narrow, badly constructed, ill-shaped houses, looking gloomy and dismal to  “the eye\n",
      " in andalus, on the contrary, the traveller will find many districts  “ where large cities and populous towns almost touch each other, without counting  “the numberless villages, hamlets, farms, castles, and towers which lie between\n",
      "  “so, for instance, going out of seville, the first day’s march will take him to  “ sherish (xerez), a very handsome city, placed in the midst of a fertile territory,  “and surrounded by villages ; close to xerez is algesiras, and then comes malaga,  “one of the finest ports in the mediterranean ; and let not the reader suppose that  “this excessive population is only to be met with in that particular district, for  “the description is applicable, as well, to any other province of andalus, this  “ being the reason why historians and geographers who have described this country  “mention so many large cities and wealthy towns\n",
      " most of these are strongly  “ fortified, and surrounded with walls, as a protection against the incursions of the  “enemy ; some, even, will be found so strong by nature, or so well fortified by  “art, as to have been besieged by the christians during twenty years without  “ falling into their hands\n",
      " this, indeed, is not so much owing to the strength of  “ their fortifications as to the undaunted courage of their defenders,—their aptitude  “ for all military exercises, to which they are trained from their infancy, and their  “ early and continual acquaintance with the perils and horrors of war, owing to  “the proximity of the enemy with whom they are in perpetual hostility\n",
      " to this  “ must be added the facility they possess of keeping their corn for several years i\n",
      "“ subterranean granaries, owing to which any city might, if necessary, stand a  “ siege of one hundred years; and what i state here concerning the strength of  “ their cities is applicable not only to the prosperous times of isl4m, but even  ‘to the present disastrous epoch ; for although it is true that at the time i write  “ the enemy of god has penetrated far into the heart of andalus, and considerably  ‘« diminished the dominions of the moslems,‘ yet there are still remaining in the  “‘ hands of the true believers cities like seville, granada, malaga, almeria, and  “ others, ruling over extensive and populous districts, full of cities and towns,  ‘© and provided with sufficient strength to resist and defeat, with god’s help and  “ assistance, all the attacks of the unbelievers\n",

      "las! the bright hopes of this holy man have been blighted, and his good  wishes frustrated, for god almighty had decreed that the contrary should happen,  and that the worshippers of the crucified should every where subdue and over-  power his own servants\n",
      " such was the will of god—him who can change  sorrow into joy, and pain into delight—the high! the great! may he permit  in his infinite wisdom that the words of islém resound again in andalus, and that  its present inhabitants be annihilated and destroyed \n",
      "ut to return to ibnu sa’id’s account\n",
      " ‘i shall conclude,” says that most  elegant of writers, “ by stating one thing in praise of andalus which will establish  “its fame much better than any\n",
      " thing else i can say\n",
      " when i quitted it i  “travelled along the northern coast of africa, and visited its great cities, such  “as marékash (morocco), fez, and ceuta; i afterwards went to africa proper,  “‘ and the neighbouring districts of the maghrebu-l-ausatt (middle west), and saw  ‘« tehdmah, bejdyeh, and tiinis ; from thence i proceeded to egypt, and resided  ‘‘in alexandria, cairo, and fostat; i then went to syria, and entered damascus,  ‘* aleppo, and other intervening cities\n",
      " well, i must confess that in the course  “‘ of my rambles i saw no country whatever which could be compared to andalus  ‘‘ either in beauty, fertility, abundance of water, or luxuriance of trees, with the  “ exception of the environs of fez in the maghrebu-l-aksd (remote west), and the  “‘ country round damascus in syria\n",
      " neither did i see in the east or west any city  ‘‘ which could compete with those of andalus in the size and solidity of its buildings, |  “for nowhere could i find such magnificent edifices and public works as i saw in  ‘‘ almost every city of andalus, unless it be some of the works lately raised at  “* morocco by the sultans of the dynasty of the beni ’abdu-l-mimen, and perhaps  “one or two at tiinis, where all the houses are built of stone as in alexandria,  ‘cowing to the great quantity of ancient stones (dug out from the ruins), only  “that the streets of tunis are not so well levelled or so broad as those of  “that city\n",

      "” \n",
      "o this account of the population of andalus by ibnu sa’id we think it proper  to add what an anonymous writer says on the subject\n",
      "* andalus contains eighty cities of the first order, and upwards of three hundred  ‘of moderate size; as to its towns, villages, hamlets, castles, and towers, their  “number is so considerable that god only can count them\n",
      " it is stated that the  “towns and villages on the banks of the guadalquivir only amounted to no less  “ than twelve thousand ; * and andalus is generally believed to be the only country  “in the world where a traveller meets with three, four, or even more cities in the  “* course of a day’s ride; finding besides at every two parasangs springs of limpid  “ water, and villages with markets and shops well provided with bread, fruit, meat,  “ fish, cheese, and all sorts of provisions\n",
      "\n",
      "the before-mentioned author (ibnu sa’id) says in another part of his work that productions o\n",
      "andalus far outstrips every other country in the world in the fertility of the land,  which yields abundant crops of all kinds ; in the delicacy of its fruits, the riches of  its mines, the wonderful productions of nature, and the number of its manufactures\n",
      "  we shall now proceed to bestow on each of these topics such information as  scattered in the authors that we have consulted\n",
      "ndalus has been compared by many authors to a terrestrial paradise ; some even  go so far as to advance that god, having forbidden the christians the entrance into  the celestial paradise, had given them instead one in this world ; for indeed by what  other name can we designate the countries which the christians inhabit from the  gulf of constantinople down to the ocean of andalus; since they are well known  to be a perpetual paradise, wherein the acorn, the filbert, the nut, the chesnut, and  other fruits of the northern climate, grow at the same time with the banana, the  sugar cane, and others which are the productions of warmer countries alone?  andalus is the country which has been most favoured by god, and in point  of fruits and other produce of the land even the most fertile regions of india  cannot compete with it\n",
      " the sugar cane grows in great luxuriance all along its  southern coast, and in more temperate® regions the banana and other delicious  fruits\n",
      " in general, except dates, which do not thrive, all the fruits of other  climates may be found in abundance, as well as many which are either scarce, or  not produced at all, in other countries, such as the two species of figs called al-iitt{  and ash-sha’rl, which grow in the neighbourhood of seville, as we have stated  elsewhere, and which ibnu sa’id says he never saw any where out of andalus\n",
      "nor ever tasted after his departure from that country\n",
      " the same might be said of  the malaga fig, or the raisins of almufiecar, or those called al-’aselt (sweet as  honey), the peaches, the apricots, the pomegranate called safart,’ the walnuts,  almonds, and several other fruits which grow in great perfection, and which we  shall not stop to enumerate and describe for fear of making this our work too  long\n",
      "nother of the productions for which andalus is famous is its aromatic woods  and roots ; in this respect indeed it has often been compared to india, that privileged  country of drugs and perfumes, which it resembles in some of its productions, as for  instance the mahleb,® that sweetest of all perfumes and choicest of drugs, which is  only to be met with in india and in andalus, and which, according to ar-rézi, is  found in great abundance in the western districts\n",
      " ibnu ghalib, quoting the words  of al-mes’tdi in his golden meadows, says that in andalus are found five-and-  twenty different perfumes or odoriferous substances, such as spikenard, clove,  gillyflower, sandal wood, cinnamon, kassdbu-dh-dhartrah,? mahleb, and others, and  that out of the five substances which are considered to be the principal ingredients  of perfumes, viz\n",
      " musk, camphor, aloe wood, saffron, and amber, the two last  are found in great quantities in andalus\n",
      " ar-rézi also, after describing some of  the properties attributed to the mahleb, says that in the district of dalayah (dalia),  which falls within the jurisdiction of the alpuxarras, grows a root called at-tdélaj,!°  which yields not to the indian aloes in fragrancy ; and which, he adds, grows in  the crevices of rocks, and was collected for the use of kheyrdn, the sclavonian king  of almeria, who liked its smell exceedingly\n",
      " kost\" (costum) and spikenard  grow also in great abundance, and the gentian, which is exported to all parts of  the world, is held in great estimation for the sweetness of its smell, and commands  a very high price\n",
      " myrrh is found in great quantities in the neighbourhood of  calatayud ; and various authors speak of a plant with which the mountains near  ossonoba are covered, and which when burnt sends forth a smell similar to that  of the aloe wood\n",
      " this account is confirmed by ibnu sa’id, who says that there  are in andalus several mountains covered with odoriferous plants and shrubs, where  if a fire be lighted the air becomes impregnated with a fragrant smell very much  resembling that of burnt aloe wood, and that in the mountain of sholayr, in that  part which is nearest to granada, grow many of the plants that are peculiar to india\n",
      "especting amber, it is found in great abundance all along the western coast of  andalus,'* especially at shidhiinah (sidonia), where it is particularly fine, and  very much prized, owing to its good quality and its resistance when exposed to  the fire\n",
      " it is known in the east by the name of al-gharbt (western), and according  to al-mes’tidi one drachm of it sold in his time for several drachms of tha\n",
      "produced in other countries\n",
      " but let us hear what al-mes’tidi himself says in his  golden meadows\n",
      " ‘‘ the seas that wash the shores of andalus, and especially the  ‘“ mediterranean, abound in amber, which is exported fo egypt and to other  “countries\n",
      " that which they use at cordova comes from a place on the western  “coast called shantareyn (santarem), as also from shidénah (sidonia)\n",
      " one  “ ounce of this amber is sold in andalus for three gold mithcals—in egypt it may be  “procured for twenty gold dinars, although inferior in quality: the ounce used in  “ andalus is equal in weight to that of baghdid\n",
      " as to the pieces of amber which  “ are now and then picked up on the coasts of egypt, it is probable that they come  “ from the mediterranean, and are impelled there by the waves\n",
      " andalus abounds  “in mines of silver and quicksilver, which have not their equal any where in the  “world, either in the countries subject to the moslems, or in those which the  “infidels occupy\n",
      " it produces also ginger root, saffron, and several other aromatic  “ roots, as well as five kinds of musk; aloes and camphor may also be pro-  “cured, although they do not grow in the country, being imported in great  “ quantities from india\n",

      " it reads thus: “‘ the seal is  “‘a quadruped whose scrotum is used as a remedy in several diseases ; they abound  “in the mediterranean, where they generally live in the water, although they often  “‘ come on shore, and are pursued by huntsmen, who catch them, and after cutting  “« off their scrotum, let them go\n",
      " i have heard the people who practise this trade say  “ that if one of these quadrupeds happens to fall a second time into their hands,  ‘* he fails not to throw himself on his back, to show his pursuers that he no longer  ‘« has the object of their wishes, upon which the men let him go unhurt\n",
      "” \n",
      "nother author says that the remedy to which we allude is also called jendu-bd-  dastar, from the animal’s name, which is likewise jendu-bddastar ;“ that it is con-  sidered a great specific in all diseases originating from cold temperaments, on  account of its being held by the physicians and naturalists as hot and dry in  the fourth degree\n",
      " some say that in size this quadruped is like a hare, 6ther\n",
      "that he is somewhat smaller, and that his flesh has a better taste ; others again make  him much larger,—but god only knows ; one thing is certain, that the skins of the  wabrah (seal), or some other quadruped resembling it, were used as an article  of dress, and much worn by christians as well as moslems\n",
      "ut it is quite time that we should say a few words about the different manufac- manufactures\n",
      "  tures that existed in andalus, which are generally acknowledged to have reached the  utmost degree of perfection, so much so that when an andalusian begins upon this  subject there is no end to his praises of his native land: we shall here slightly  mention a few; as, for instance, its manufactures of sashes,** which were famous  all over the world for brilliancy of colours and fineness of texture ; its silver and  gold tissues manufactured at almeria, malaga, and murcia, with such perfection  that when taken to eastern countries the people were amazed and bewildered  at the sight of them\n",
      " of the manufactures established at almeria we have  already spoken elsewhere, when we gave the description of that city; we shall  only add here, by way of supplement, that all the stuffs woven by its industrious  inhabitants were at all times in great demand in the east and west, and that a  very considerable trade was carried on in this, as well as in other products of their  industry, both with moslems and christians\n",
      " at tentala, a town depending on  murcia, there were manufactures of carpets called tental{,“© which, when exported  to the east, brought a very high price\n",
      " both granada and baza were famous for  the manufacture of certain warm stuffs for winter called al-mulabbad,”—they were  generally of woollen, stamped,*® and dyed of the most beautiful and delicate colours\n",
      "  murcia was likewise famous for the manufacture of coats of mail, breast-plates, and  all sorts of steel armour, inlaid with gold; saddles and horse-harness richly set in  gold; all kinds of instruments of brass and iron, as knives, scissors, and other  trinkets, inlaid with gold, such as are used in weddings to present to the bride; and,  above all, weapons and other warlike instruments, which were so highly finished  and wrought in such perfection as to dazzle with their brightness the eyes of the  beholder\n",
      "*® all these articles, tbnu sa’id informs us, were exported to africa and  other more distant countries, where they were held in great estimation\n",
      " murcia  was likewise renowned for the fabrication of glass and pottery, of both which  materials they made large vases of the most exquisite and elegant shapes; they  manufactured also glazed pottery, and another kind which was washed over with  gold\n",
      " the manufactures of malaga have already been described by us under the  head of that city ; it was famous above all things for its glass and pottery, and for  many articles of clothing\n",
      "e find also that there were in andalus several manufactures of al-mafssass,°°  which is known in the east by the name of al-foseyfasd (mosaic), as well as of a sor\n",
      "of tile called az-zulaj*! (azulejo), which they used in paving the floors of their  houses\n",
      " the azulejos were made of all sorts of gay colours, and very much re-  sembled the al-mafssass; they were exported in great quantities to the east, and  used instead of marble flags to make mosaic floors, to pave fountains, and other  similar ornaments\n",
      "s to weapons and military stores of all kinds, such as shields, swords, spears,  helmets, breast-plates, bows, arrows, saddles, bits, bridles, and all kinds of horse-  trappings, the manufactures of andalus exceeded those of any other country in the  world ; and according to ibnu sa’id (from whom the preceding narrative is abridged)  that part of the country which was in the hands of the infidels was likewise famous  for the manufacture of arms, so highly polished as to dazzle the eyes; amongst  which he makes particular mention of certain sharp-edged, well-tempered swords,  called al-bordheliat, from bordhil (bourdeaux), a city placed at the north-eastern  extremity of andalus\n",
      " the same author speaks in the highest terms of the swords  manufactured at seville, and which, he says, were not inferior to those of india\n",
      "  seville is likewise represented by him as a city of great trade, and where several  manufactures of rich clothing and costly articles existed\n",
      " \n",
      " the town of xativa, near  valencia, was well known for its paper manufactures, of which a large quantity was  annually exported to maghreb, and to other parts of africa\n",
      " but we shall not  dwell any longer on this topic, inasmuch as we have already given some details,  under the head of those cities and districts where the objects were manufactured,  and we may again occasionally allude to them in the course of this our narrative\n",

      "havine thus far sketched some of the peculiarities of andalus, we shall now government\n",
      "  proceed to say a few words on its government and institutions, as well as on the  customs and manners of its inhabitants\n",
      " our narrative will be mostly borrowed  from tbnu sa’id, an author who has treated the question at large in his kitdbu-l-  mugh’rab, in a chapter entitled ‘‘ shining stars in the just and impartial descrip-  tion of the eastern and western governments\n",
      "”! these are that author’s words :  “ andalus, which was conquered in the year 92 of the hijra, continued for many  “years to be a dependency of the eastern khalifate, until it was snatched away  “from their hands by one of the surviving members of the family of umeyyah,  “ who, crossing over from barbary, subdued the country, and formed therein an  \"independent kingdom, which he transmitted to his posterity\n",
      " during three  “centuries and a half, andalus, governed by the princes of this dynasty, reached the  “utmost degree of power and prosperity, until civil war breaking out among its  “ inhabitants, the moslems, weakened by internal discord, became every where the  “ prey of the artful christians, and the territory of islim was considerably reduced,  “so much so that at the present moment the worshippers of the crucified hold  “the greatest part of andalus in their hands, and their country is divided into  “ various powerful kingdoms, whose rulers assist each other whenever the moslems  “attack their territories\n",
      " this brings to my recollection the words of an eastern  ‘‘ geographer who visited andalus in the fourth century of the hijra,? and during  “the prosperous times of the cordovan khalifate, i mean ibnu haukal an-  “nassibi,> who, describing andalus, speaks in very unfavourable terms of its  “inhabitants\n",
      " as his words require refutation i shall transcribe here the whole  ‘of the passage\n",
      " ‘ andalus,’ he says, ‘is an extensive island, a little less than a  “month’s march in length, and twenty and odd days in width\n",
      " it abounds i\n",
      "rivers and springs, is covered with trees and plants of every description, and is  “ amply provided with every article which adds to the comforts of life; slaves are  “« very fine, and may be procured for a small price on account of their abundance ;  “ owing, too, to the fertility of the land, which yields all sorts of grain, vegetables,  “and fruit, as well as to the number and goodness of its pastures in which innu-  merable flocks of cattle graze, food is exceedingly abundant and cheap, and the  inhabitants are thereby plunged into indolence and sloth, letting mechanics and  men of the lowest ranks of society overpower them and conduct their affairs\n",
      "  owing to this it is really astonishing how the island of andalus still remains in  the hands of the moslems, being, as they are, people of vicious habits and low  inclinations, narrow-minded, and entirely devoid of fortitude, courage, and the  military accomplishments necessary to meet face to face the formidable nations of  christians who surround them on every side, and by whom they are continually  “ assailed\n",
      "’ \n",
      "such are the words of ibnu haukal; but, if truth be told, i am at a loss  to guess to whom they are applied\n",
      " to my countrymen they certainly are  not ; or, if so, it is a horrible calumny, for if any people on the earth are famous  “ for their courage, their noble qualities, and good habits, it is the moslems of  andalus ; and indeed their readiness to fight the common enemy, their con-  stancy in upholding the holy tenets of, their religion, and their endurance of  the hardships and privations of war, have become almost proverbial\n",
      " so, as  far as this goes, ibnu haukal is decidedly in error, for as the proverb says,  ‘the tongue of stammering is at times more eloquent than the tongue of  eloquence\n",
      "’* as to the other imputation, namely, their being devoid of all  sense, wisdom, and talent, either in the field or in administration, would to  god that the author’s judgment were correct, for then the ambition of the  chiefs would not have been raised, and the moslems would not have turned  against each other’s breasts and dipped in each other’s blood those very  ‘“* weapons which god almighty put into their hands for the destruction and  “ annihilation of the infidel christian\n",
      " but, as it is, we ask—were those sultans  and khalifs wanting in prudence and talents who governed this country for  upwards of five hundred years, and who administered its affairs in the midst  of foreign war and civil discord? were those fearless warriors deficient in  courage and military science who withstood on the frontiers of the moslem  empire the frightful shock of the innumerable infidel nations who dwell within  and out of andalus, whose extensive territories cover a surface of three months’  march, and all of whom ran to arms at a moment’s notice to defend the religion  “‘ of the crucified? and if it be true that at the moment i write the moslem\n",
      "“have been visited by the wrath of heaven, and that the almighty has sent down  “defeat and shame to their arms, are we to wonder at it at a time when the  “christians, proud of their success, have carried their arms as far as syria  “and mesopotamia, have invaded the districts contiguous to the country which  “is the meeting-place of the moslems, and the cupola of islam, committed all  “sorts of ravages and depredations, conquered the city of haleb (aleppo) and  “its environs, and done other deeds which are sufficiently declared in the  “histories of the time? no, it is by no means to be wondered at, especially  “when proper attention is paid to the manner in which the andalusian moslems  ‘have come to their present state of weakness and degradation\n",
      " the process  “is this: the christians will rush down from their mountains, or across the  “plain, and make an incursion into the moslem territory ; there they will  “ pounce upon a castle and seize it; they will ravage the neighbouring country,  “take the inhabitants captive, and then retire to their country with all the  “plunder they have collected, leaving, nevertheless, strong garrisons in the  “castles and towers captured by them\n",
      " in the meanwhile the moslem king  “in whose dominions the inroad has been made, instead of attending to his  “own interests and stopping the disease by applying cauterization, will be  “waging war against his neighbours of the moslems; and these, instead of  “defending the common cause, the cause of religion and truth,—instead of  “assisting their brother, will confederate and ally to deprive him of whatever  “dominions still remain in his hands\n",
      " so, from a trifling evil at first, it will  “grow into an irreparable calamity, and the christians will advance farther  “and farther until they subdue the whole of that country exposed to their  “inroads, where, once established and fortified, they will direct their attacks  “to another part of the moslem territories, and carry on the same war of havoc  “and destruction\n",
      " nothing of this, however, existed at the time when ibnu  “haukal visited andalus; for although we are told by ibnu hayydn and  “other writers that the christians began as early as the reign of ’abdu-r-  “rahmén iii\n",
      " to grow powerful, and to annoy the moslems on the frontiers,’  “vet it is evident that until the breaking out of the civil wars, which raged  “with uncommon violence throughout andalus, the encroachments of the  “barbarians on the extensive and unprotected frontiers of the moslem empire  “were but of little consequence\n",
      " but to return to our subject\n",
      " during the first years after the conquest the  “government of andalus was vested in the hands of military commanders  “appointed by the viceroys of africa, who were themselves named by the  “ khalifs of damascus\n",
      " these governors united in their hands the comman\n",
      "‘‘of the armies and the civil power, but, being either removed as soon as  “named, or deposed by military insurrections, much confusion and disorder  ‘reigned at all times in the state, and the establishment and consolidation  “of the moslem power in andalus were thwarted in their progress at the  “very onset\n",
      " it was not until the arrival of the beni umeyyah in andalus  “that the fabric of islim may be said to have rested on a solid foundation\n",
      "  “when ’abdu-r-rahmén ibn mu’awiyeh had conquered the country, when every  ‘‘ rebel had submitted to him, when all his opponents had sworn allegiance to  “him, and his authority had been universally acknowledged, then his importance  “increased, his ambition spread wider, and both he and his successors displayed  “the greatest magnificence in their court, and about their persons and retinue,  “‘as likewise in the number of officers and great functionaries of the state\n",
      " at  “first they contented themselves with the title of beni-i-khaldyif (sons of  “the khalifs),® but in process of time, when the limits of their empire had  “‘ been considerably extended by their conquests on the opposite land of africa,  “they took the appellation of khalifs and omard-l-mimenin (princes of the  “ believers)\n",
      " it is generally known that the strength and solidity of their  ‘“‘ empire consisted principally in the policy pursued by these princes, the mag-  “ nificence and splendour with which they surrounded their court, the reverential  “ awe with which they inspired their subjects, the inexorable rigour with which they  “« chastised every aggression on their rights, the impartiality of their judgments,  “ their ‘anxious solicitude in the observance of the civil law, their regard and  “attention to the learned, whose opinions they respected and followed, calling  ‘them to their sittings and admitting them to their councils, and many other  ‘ brilliant qualities; in proof of which frequent anecdotes occur in the works\n",
      "  ‘of ibnu hayydn and other writers; as, for instance, that whenever a judge  “ summoned the khalif, his son, or any of his most beloved favourites, to appear  “in his presence as a witness in a judicial case, whoever was the individual  “ summoned would attend in person—if the khalif, out of respect for the law  “—and if a subject, for fear of incurring his master’s displeasure\n",
      " but when this salutary awe and impartial justice had vanished, the decay  “of their empire began, and it was followed by a complete ruin\n",
      " i have already  “‘ observed that the princes of that dynasty were formerly styled omard-bnd-l-  “ kholafé (amirs, sons of the khalifs),° but that in latter times they assumed  “the title of omard-l-mimenin (princes of the believers)\n",
      " this continued until  “the disastrous times of the civil war, when the surviving members of the  “ royal family hated each other, and when those who had neither the nobility  “nor the qualities required to honour the khalifate pretended to it and wishe\n",
      "“for it; when the governors of provinces and the generals of armies declared  “themselves independent and rose every where in their governments, taking  “the title of moliku-t-tawdyif!° (kings of small estates), and when confusion  “and disorder were at their highest pitch\n",
      " these petty sovereigns, of whom  “some read the khotbah™ for the khalifs of the house of merwan—in whose  “hands no power whatsoever remained—while others proclaimed the abbasside  “ sultans, and acknowledged their imam, all began to exercise the powers and  “to use the appendages of royalty, assuming even the titles and names of  “former khalifs, and imitating in every thing the bearing and splendour of  “the most powerful sovereigns,—a thing which they were enabled to accomplish  “from the great resources of the countries over which they ruled,—for although  ‘“ andalus was divided into sundry petty kingdoms, yet such was the fertility  “of the land, and the amount of taxes collected from it, that the chief of a  “limited state could at times display at his court a greater magnificence than  “the ruler of extensive dominions\n",
      " however, the greatest among them did  “not hesitate to assume, as i have already observed, the names and titles of  “the most famous eastern khalifs ; for instance, ibnu rashik al-kairwani'? says  “that ’abbéd ibn mohammed ibn ’abbdd took the surname of al-mu’atadhed,  “and imitated in all things the mode of life and bearing of the abbasside khalif  “ al-mu’atadhed-billah ; * his son, mohammed ibn ’abbad, was styled al-  “mu’atamed; both reigned in seville, to which kingdom they in process of  “time added cordova and other extensive territories in the southern and western  “ parts of andalus, as will hereafter be shown\n",
      "as long as the dynasty\n",
      " of umeyyah occupied the throne of cordova, the  “successors of ’abdu-r-rahman contrived to inspire their subjects with love of  “their persons, mixed with reverential awe; this they accomplished by sur-  “rounding their courts with splendour, by displaying the greatest magnificence  “ whenever they appeared in public, and by employing other means which i have  “ already hinted at, and deem it not necessary to repeat: they continued thus until  “the times of the civil war, when, having lost the affections of the people, their  “ subjects began to look with an evil eye at their prodigal expense, and the extra-  “vagant pomp with which they surrounded their persons\n",
      " then came the beni  “ hamid,’ the descendants of idris, of the progeny of ’ali ibn abi talib, who,  “ having snatched the khalifate from the hands of the beni merwan, ruled for some  “ time over the greatest part of andalus\n",
      " these princes showed also great osten-  “ tation, and, assuming the same titles that the abbasside khalifs had borne, they  “ followed their steps in every thing concerning the arrangement of their courts  “and persons ; for instance, whenever a munshid'® wanted to extemporize som\n",
      "“verses in praise of his sovereign, or any subject wished to address him on  “ particular business, the poet or the petitioner was introduced to the presence of  “* the khalif, who sat behind a curtain and spoke without showing himself, the hdjib  “ or curtain-drawer standing all the time by his side to communicate to the party  “the words or intentions of the khalif\n",
      " so when ibnu mokéné al-lishboni  “ (from lisbon), the poet, appeared in presence of the hajib of idris ibn yahya  ‘* al-hamidi, who was proclaimed khalif at malaga,’® to recite that kassidah of his  “‘ which is so well known and rhymes in min, when he came to that part which  “runs thus—  ‘ the countenance of idris, son of yahya, son of ’ali, son of hamid, prince  ‘of the believers, is like a rising sun; it, dazzles the eyes of those who look  ‘at it—  ‘ let us see it, let us seize the rays of yonder light, for it is the light of the  ‘ master of the worlds ’—'7  “the sultan himself drew the curtain which concealed him, and said to the  “ poet—‘ look, then,’ and showed great affability to ibn mokénd, and rewarded  “him very handsomely\n",
      "  ‘* but when, through the civil war, the country was broken up into sundry petty  “* sovereignties, the new monarchs followed quite a different line of politics ; for,  ‘‘ wishing to become popular, they treated their subjects with greater familiarity,  “and had a more frequent intercourse with all classes of society; they often  ‘ reviewed their troops, and visited their provinces ; they invited to their presence  “‘ the doctors and poets, and wished to be held from the beginning of their reign as  ‘the patrons of science and literature: but even this contributed to the depression  “* of the royal authority, which thus became every day less dreaded ; besides, the  “arms of the moslems being employed during the long civil wars against one  “another, the inhabitants of the different provinces began to look on each other  “‘ with an evil eye ; the ties by which they were united became loose, and a number  “* of independent states were formed, the government of which passed from father to  ‘son, in the same manner as the empire of cordova had been transmitted to  “‘ the sons and heirs of the khalifs\n",
      " thus separated from each other, the moslems  “‘ began to consider themselves as members of different nations, and it became  ‘“‘ every day more difficult for them to unite in the common cause; and owing  “ to their divisions, and to their mutual enmity, as well as to the sordid interest and  “ extravagant ambition of some of their kings, the christians were enabled to attack  “ them in detail, and subdue them one after the other\n",
      " however, by the arrival of  “the beni ’abdu-l-miimen all those little states were again blended into one, and  “ the whole of andalus acknowledged their sway, and continued for many years t\n",
      "‘‘be ruled by their successors, until, civil war breaking out again, ibn hid,  “surnamed al-mutawdkel,!® revolted, and finding the people of andalus ill-dis-  “ posed against the almohades, and anxious to shake off their yoke, he easily made  “himself master of the country\n",
      " ibn hid, however, followed the policy of his  “ predecessors (the kings of the small states); he even surpassed them in folly and  “ ignorance of the rules of good government, for he used to walk about the streets  “and markets, conversing and laughing with the lowest people, asking them  “ questions, and doing acts unsuitable to his high station, and which no subject  “ever saw a sultan do before, so much so that it was said, not without foun-  “ dation, that he looked more like a performer of legerdemain than a king\n",
      " fools,  “and the ignorant vulgar seemed, it is true, to gaze with astonishment an\n",
      "pleasure at this familiarity, but as the poet has said—  ‘ these are things to make the fools laugh, but the consequences of whic\n",
      "‘ these symptoms went on increasing until populous cities and extensive dis-  “tricts became the prey of the christians, and whole kingdoms were snatched  “from the hands of the moslems\n",
      " another very aggravating circumstance added  “its weight to the general calamity, namely, the facility with which the power  “changed hands\n",
      " whoever has read attentively what we have just said® about  “the mode of attaining and using the royal power in andalus, must be convinced  “ that-nothing was so easy, especially in latter times, as to arrive at it\n",
      " the process  “is this: whenever a knight is known to surpass his countrymen in courage,  “ generosity, or any of those qualities which make a man dear to the vulgar, the  “people cling to him, follow his party, and soon after proclaim him their king,  “without paying the least regard to his ascendancy, or stopping to consider  “whether he is of royal blood or not\n",
      " the new king then transmits the state as  “an inheritance to his son or nearest relative, and thus a new dynasty is formed\n",
      " i  “may, in proof of this, quote a case which has just taken place among us: a  “certain captain” made himself famous by his exploits, and the victories he won  “over the enemy, as likewise by his generous and liberal disposition towards  “the citizens and the army; all of a sudden his friends and partisans resolved  “to raise him to the throne, and regardless of their own safety, as well as that  ‘‘of their families, friends, and clients residing at court, and whose lives were  “by their imprudence put in great jeopardy, they rose in a castle, and pro-  “claimed him king ; and they never ceased toiling, calling people to their ranks,  “and fighting their opponents, until their object was accomplished, and their  “ friend solidly established on his throne\n",
      " now eastern people are more cautious  “about altering the succession, and changing the reigning dynasty ; they will o\n",

      "“ the contrary avoid it by all possible means, and do their best to leave the power  ‘in the hands of the reigning family, rather than let discord and civil dissen-  “sions sap the foundations of the state, and introduce dissolution and corruption  “into the social body\n",
      "* among us the change of dynasty is a thing of frequent occurrence, and the  “‘ present ruler of andalus, ibnu-l-ahmar, is another instance of what i have  “advanced\n",
      " he was a good soldier, and had been very successful in some ex-  “* peditions against the christians, whose territories he was continually invading,  “ sallying out at the head of his followers from a castle called hisn-arjénah  ‘* (arjona),”” where he generally resided\n",
      " being a shrewd man, and versed in all  “the stratagems of war, he seldom went out on an expedition without returning  ‘* victorious, and laden with plunder, owing to which he amassed great riches, and  “ the number of his partisans and followers was considerably increased\n",
      " at last,  ‘ being prompted by ambition to aspire to the royal power, he at first caused his  “troops to proclaim him king; then sallying out of his stronghold he got  ‘* possession of cordova, marched against seville, took it, and killed its king  ‘* al-baji\n",
      "% after this he subdued jaen, the strongest and most important city  ** in all andalus, owing to its walls and the position it occupies, conquered likewise  ‘“‘ malaga, granada, and their districts, and assumed the title of amfru-l-moslemin  “* (prince of the moslems) ; and at the moment i write he is obeyed all over andalus\n",
      " and every one looks to him for advice and protection\n",
      "” \n",
      "he preceding has been transcribed from ibnu sa’id’s work, where the subject i is  treated at length: we shall now extract from him and from ibnu khaldiin some  particulars concerning the charges or public offices which composed the government  of the different dynasties in andalus\n",
      "he charge of wizir during the times of the beni umeyyah was common to  several functionaries, to whose deliberation and inspection the chief of the state  submitted the affairs of the government\n",
      " the historian, ibnu khaldiin, who in his :  book of the subject and attribute has defined the functions of these and other officers  of the court of the khalifs, says that the title of wizir, under the sultans of  cordova, was given to certain functionaries in whose hands rested the management  of public affairs, and each of whom had under his care one branch of the admi«  nistration ; for instance, the financial department, the foreign relations, the ad-  ministration of justice and redress of injuries, and, lastly, the care of the frontiers  and the provision and equipment of the troops stationed on them, would each  constitute a separate and independent office under the special care of a wizir\n",
      "  these functionaries enjoyed besides the right of sitting in the audience-room with  the khalif, and it was from among them that he chose his nayib, called in the eas\n",
      "chief, or grand, wizir, but who in andalus was designated by the name of hajib\n",
      "  these dignities were moreover conferred on certain noble families, until at last  they became almost like an inheritance ;* so that notwithstanding the governors  and generals, who shared among themselves the dominions of the khalifs, soon  began to assume the signs of royalty, they still considered the titles of wizir and  héjib as a very honourable distinction, and styled themselves hdjibs of the beni  umeyyah, as if they were merely governing their states in their name\n",
      " some  even thought that no title could be more honourable, for we see them continually  designated under that appellation either by poets singing their praises, or by  historians relating their actions\n",
      "he appellation of wizir was therefore given to all those who sat in council  with, or were admitted into the privacy of, the sovereign; so that the wizir,  who to the right of sitting in council united the duties of the administration (in any  particular branch), was distinguished by the title of dhz-l-wizdrateyn, that is, the  holder of the two offices; and he had therefore to unite to the general accomplish-  ments in literature which were required from the other functionaries a profound  knowledge of the science of government\n",
      "he office of katib or secretary was of two kinds: the most important was called kitin\n",

      " the second was called kitdbatu-dh-dhimdm (office of pro-  tection), and corresponded exactly to that of the kdtibu-l-jihbadheh™ in the east :  the person intrusted with this office had, as its name sufficiently indicates, to attend  to the protection and security of the christians and jews ; and it may be said without  exaggeration, that so long as this office subsisted in andalus and in the maghreb  no christian or jew ever needed the protection and assistance of the great and  powerful\n",
      " both these functionaries were called katibs, a title in which they  gloried, and which they considered as the most honourable which they could  receive; so that whoever wanted to honour or praise them never failed while  addressing them, either verbally or in writing, to call them katibs ; besides, the  andalusians showed always the greatest respect for all individuals entitled to that  denomination, and never by any means forgot to do so when they addressed one  of them ; for had any one by mistake or otherwise omitted this, or suppressed any  other of their honorific titles, neither the rank, riches, nor high station of th\n",

      "o public office whatever equalled that of the sdhibu-l-ashghdl, or collector of  taxes, in authority and importance, and the person who was at the head of it was  considered more powerful and influential than a wizir; he had more followers, and  could count a greater number of friends; the emoluments attached to his place  were also more considerable, all necks bowed before him, all hands were stretched  out to him, and he kept the provinces in awe by means of his overseers and in-  formers\n",
      " yet with all this, and though this was a most desirable appointment—  one which gave so much influence and importance to its holder, and in which  considerable riches might be amassed in a very short time—it was a dangerous one,  and full of hazards and cares\n",
      " but this does not belong to our subject, as it  depends upon the changes of fortune, and the character of the sultan\n",
      "he charge of kadi was always reputed in andalus as the most honourable of all,  not only on account of his spiritual jurisdiction, all religious affairs being exclusively  intrusted to his care, but also owing to the great independence and power which  that office gave to its holders ; for, as we have observed elsewhere, if a kaédi sum-  moned the khalif to his presence, the latter would immediately obey the summons,  —at least such appear to have been the prerogatives annexed to that office during  the reign of the beni umeyyah, and such of the sovereigns of the petty dynasties as  followed their system of government\n",
      " the title of kadi ought in strictness to be  applied to those only who exercised the functions of judges in a city or large town ;  if the place was small he was called hékim\n",
      " the kédi-l-kodé (or chief kédf) was  also called kddiu-l-jamd@’h\n",
      "he office of the sdhibu-sh-shartah ® was the same as it is in our days, and its  functions nearly similar to those now attached to that post in africa\n",
      " the vulgar  called him sdhibu-l-medinah (city magistrate), and sdhibu-l-leyl (night magistrate)\n",
      "  the functions of this office were at one time of a most formidable description, for  if he were at all in favour with the sultén, and had his confidence, he could sentence  to death any one he pleased, and have the sentence executed without any previous  leave from the sovereign\n",
      " however, this appears to have been but of rare oc-  currence ; neither was the appointment much used, being only to be met with in  great capitals, and at the court of the sultan\n",
      " abi zeyd ibn khaldin treats at  length of the functions of this officer,°' which seem to have consisted in the detection  and punishment of crimes against morality—such as adultery, the drinking of in-  toxicating liquors, and so forth\n",
      " other civil offences fell also under his jurisdiction\n",
      "  in former times, however, this office could not exist without the express consen\n",

      "he office of the mohtesib®? was generally conferred in andalus on men of mohtesib\n",
      "  probity, experience, and learning, and who belonged to the class of the kadis\n",
      "  the duties of this officer consisted in riding, early in the morning, through the  market, followed by his guards, one of whom carried a pair of scales in his hand,  to weigh the bread ; for in andalus the weight and price of bread was at all times  fixed by the authorities ; so, for instance, a loaf of a certain weight would sell for  the fourth of a dirhem, and another of half its size for the eighth of a dirhem\n",
      "  these measures, moreover, produced so good an effect, that whoever wanted  provisions for his daily consumption might send to market a little boy or a  simple girl, with directions to buy whatever he wanted, and yet be perfectly  satisfied that no imposition was practised upon him, and that every article had  its proper weight\n",
      " the sale of meat was likewise subjected to the same rule,  it being enjoined to every butcher to have over his stall a label, with an inscription  marking the price fixed by the authorities of the town\n",
      " so neither bakers nor  butchers dared to sell their articles for a higher price, nor cheat in the weight ; for  were the mohtesib to entertain the least suspicion about one of them, he would  soon put him to the test by sending a boy or girl to buy some bread or meat from  him, and if, when weighed, it was found to be in the least deficient, he would  punish the infractor, and fine him heavily ; this for the first time, for if he were to  be found in fault again, the magistrate would sentence him to be publicly flogged,  and exposed in the market-place for the salutary warning of all the rest of the  dealers, after which he would banish him the city\n",
      " the office of the mohtesib was  further made to extend to all articles of sale, and those who filled it had to learn  certain practices or rules before being fit to obtain it; in the same manner as a  faquih would among us study the decisions of the law before he would be con-  sidered fit to fill the situation of a kédi\n",

      "s to the night-watch, whom we call in the west tawdfu-i-leyl, and who in the ad-dirabin, or  east are called as‘hab-arbd’,* they were generally designated in andalus under the neues  name of ad-ddrabin (gate-keepers), on account of certain interior gates which most  of the cities in that country had, and which it was the duty of those guards to shut  every evening after the prayer of ’atemah, thereby preventing any communication  between the various quarters of the city during the night\n",
      " every one of these  gates had its watchman, who, besides being well armed, was provided with a dark  lantern, and had with him a dog to warn him by his bark if any noise was heard\n",
      "  “ all these precautions,” adds ibnu sa’id, ‘are indispensable in the large cities  “of andalus, owing to the great number of thieves and vagabonds who eithe\n",

      "in  ‘“‘ their discovery and apprehension\n",
      " it is therefore a thing of frequent occurrence  ‘in andalus to hear people say,—‘ last night robbers broke into the house of such  “a one, or such a one was found murdered in his bed\n",
      "’”’ it is true, observes our  author, that crimes of this kind are not equally common all over andalus, and  are generally confined to large cities, and, even there, they are more or less frequent  according to the severity or indifference shown by the authorities; but in general  it must be owned that although the greatest rigour has been at times employed  against robbers, so much as to inflict capital punishment for stealing a bunch of  grapes out of a vineyard, and that the sword of justice has dropped with their  blood, andalus has never been quite free from that scourge\n",
      " a very entertaining  anecdote is told of a famous highwayman, called al-bdziyu-l-ash’ab (the grey-hawk),  who lived in the time of al-mu’atamed, king of seville\n",
      " he was renowned for his °  dexterity and courage, and soon became the scourge of the country; for at the  head of a small band of chosen followers he began to scour the fields, surprising  the inhabitants in their farms and villages, and depriving them of their valuables\n",
      "  long did he baffle the search of justice, and escape from every troop sent for his  apprehension ; but, at last, he fell one day into the hands of the king’s officers, and  the event being reported to al-mu’atamed, he was sentenced to be crucified by the  side of a much-frequented path, in the midst of the very district which had been the  principal theatre of his depredations\n",
      " the sentence having been duly carried into  execution, the poor man was hanging miserably stretched on the cross, when, behold !  his wife and daughters came up, and began to sob and wail around him, exclaiming,  in the midst of their tears, “our doom is signed, and our deaths are certain ; who  “« shall provide for us when thou art no more?” they were thus lamenting over  their misfortune when a peasant happened to pass by, riding on a mule, and having  before him something like a large bundle of clothes or goods\n",
      "—‘‘ friend,” said the  robber on the cross to the passenger, “take pity on me, and, since thou seest me  ‘in this condition, grant me a last favour, which will prove beneficial to thee too\n",
      "”  “ and what is it, pray?” said the peasant\n",
      " ‘go to yonder well,” replied the  robber, ‘‘ and thou shalt find at the bottom one hundred dindrs in a purse, which,  “as i was closely pursued by the constables, i threw therein ; if thou succeed in  “‘ getting them out, half shall be thy reward; the remaining half thou must  “ give to my wife and daughters here, that they may support themselves for \n",
      "“ while after my death\n",
      " go, hasten to the spot, and do not be afraid ; my wife will  “« assist thee in thy descent by holding a rope, and my daughters will take care  “‘ of thy mule\n",
      "” the peasant consented, upon the offered conditions, and bent his  steps towards the well; there he tied a rope round his waist, ‘and, assisted by the  woman, began to let himself down, but no sooner had he reached the bottom than  the robber’s wife cut the rope, and the poor wretch was left in the water struggling  and screaming, while his deceiver, as may easily be imagined, hastened to the spot  where his mule was, seized on whatever property he carried, and quickly dis-  appeared with her daughters\n",
      " the poor man, in the meanwhile, finding the depth of  the well, and that he had not the means of getting out, began to cry out as loud as  he could, in hopes of calling the attention of some passenger ; and the hollow of the  well rang with his cries of ‘‘help! help!” it was summer time, and the weather  very hot, so that many travellers approached the well to draw water for themselves  and their beasts; but the moment one of them came near to it, and heard the voice  of the poor peasant inside, he ran away from it in great fright and consternation,  not knowing what caused the pitiful lamentations and wailings that issued from the  water\n",
      " for many a long hour did the unhappy man remain in this miserable  plight, until some of the passengers having acquainted each other with the circum-  stance, they came to the resolution of returning to the spot, and ascertaining the  cause of the strange noises they had heard\n",
      " hastening back to the well, they  soon discovered the peasant lying at the bottom of it, who, by means of a rope  thrown him, was speedily extricated from the dangerous situation in which he lay\n",
      "  being asked how he had come by his misfortune, he told them that he had been  deceived, and pointing to the highwayman on the cross, ‘‘ yonder knave,”’ said he,  “* was the cause of it, in order to give his wife and daughters an opportunity to  “ plunder me\n",
      "” however, the adventure soon became known in seville, whither the  peasant directed his course, and being reported to a]-mu’atamed, he was surprised  to hear of the robber’s cunning and impudence; and wishing to see him, and  interrogate him on the subject, he commanded that grey-hawk should be made  to appear in his presence\n",
      " agreeably to his orders, the robber was let down from  the cross, and brought before the king, who addressed him thus: ‘‘ tell me, o  “ grey-hawk ! how couldst thou be guilty of such a crime as that now imputed to  “thee, and that too, being, as it were, under the clutch of death?” ‘“o king!”  replied the robber, “ if thou knewest how strongly nature impels me to the  ‘* perpetration of such acts, and how great is the pleasure i enjoy while i commit  “them, ihave no doubt but that thou wouldst relinquish the royal power, and  “‘ embrace my profession\n",
      "” al-mu’atamed could not help smiling when he heard  this; he then said, after some time, ‘‘ o grey-hawk! were i to set thee at liberty\n",
      "“ and treat thee kindly,—were i to act generously towards thee, and allow thee a  “ pension for thy maintenance and that of thy family,—tell me, wouldst thou repent  “of thy misdeeds, and forsake thy criminal practices?” ‘if repentance,” said  grey-hawk, “‘ is to be my only way to salvation, i do not hesitate to accept life under  ‘* such conditions\n",
      "” upon which, al-mu’atamed, having previously made him swear  to keep his engagement, liberated him, and gave him the command of a resolute  band for the prosecution and detection of thieves in a particular quarter of the city\n",
      "  but to return\n",
      "hese appear to have been the principal offices during the reign of the beni  umeyyah and those of the petty sovereigns who usurped the power after them;  there are still some civil as well as military appointments which we have  passed in silence for brevity’s sake, such as the wali, or governor of a  province, the kdyidu-l-asdtil (admiral of the fleet*), and others\n",
      " in general,  the sulténs of the house of merwdn were distinguished for their care in  naming to these offices the individuals most fit for their several duties, as  also for having vied with each other in distinguishing and honouring the  learned, raising them in rank or command, and admitting them to their  privacy and favour: they were never known to appoint an undeserving wizir  nor a kadi, nor to grant a seat in their council-room but to those who  had given ample proofs of sagacity and learning\n",
      " they always showed the  greatest respect for the opinions of the learned, as is well known in the case  of al-hakem, who, persuaded by some strict theologians who were averse to  wine, commanded that all the vines in his dominions should be rooted up,  although, on the suggestion of some of his favourites, who represented to him  that he could not prevent wine being made in other countries, and intro-  duced into andalus, he relaxed in severity, and the order was never carried  into execution\n",
      "*® they never appointed any to the charge of mufti, or to the  examination of witnesses, but men of great learning and experience, and well  read in the koran, and in the decisions of the law\n",
      " they were also to be rich,  or at least to be possessed of a decent income, lest their poverty should induce  them to covet the property of others, and sell justice to the pleaders\n",
      " ash-  shakandi, from whom the foregoing details are borrowed, relates an anecdote  which we shall transcribe here, as illustrative of what we have advanced\n",
      " ‘“ al-  “‘hakem, surnamed ar-rabadht*’ (he of the suburb), wishing once to appoint  “one of the most distinguished theologians of cordova to the special charge of  “« receiving the declarations of witnesses, consulted with yahya ibn yahya,** ’abdu-  ‘* |-mdlik,®® and other doctors, upon the propriety of his nomination, and asked  “‘ them to give him their opinion on the person of his choice\n",
      " the doctors the\n",
      "“ said in reply,—‘ o prince of the believers! the individual thou hast chosen is  “no doubt an able and very worthy man, but he is exceedingly poor, and  ‘whoever has not an independent fortune to live upon ought by no means to  “be imtrusted with the decisions of the law, and be made the judge between  ‘the moslems ; especially if thou wishest him to derive utility and profit from  ‘his office, and yet to be just and impartial in his judgments when he has  “to decide between the executors*® of a will and the heirs appointed in it\n",
      "’  “on hearing this al-hakem kept silence, and did not seem inclined to accept of  “their remonstrances ; on the contrary, he appeared to be angry and disappointed  “at seeing the doctors oppose his will\n",
      " the counsellors then left the room, and  “ al-hakem remained thoughtful, until his son ’abdu-r-rahmdén, who succeeded  “him in the empire, happening to come in, and seeing sorrow and anger on his  “countenance, inquired the cause of it\n",
      " ‘ what ails thee, o father! who has  “displeased thee ?? ‘ hast thou not seen,’ said al-hakem, ‘ those whom i  “extolled and raised above all others, and whom i have distinguished so far as  “to consult them on matters which neither concerned them, nor affected them  “in the least, wishing us to turn our faces from our intention, and shutting  “upon us the gates of intercession ?’—and then he told his son what had  “occurred\n",
      " ‘o, father!’ replied ’abdu-r-rahmdn, ‘thou art the dispenser of  “ justice, and thy uprightness exceeds that of any other sultan on the earth ;  “in appointing and distinguishing the men of whom thou now complainest,  “thy object was, no doubt, not to raise and extol them, but to honour science  “through their means; so i see no remedy for it unless thou removest them  “from their situations, and take away their dignities and honours to confer  ‘them on ignorant people\n",
      "’ ‘ certainly not,’ said al-hakem, ‘that i will  “never do\n",
      "’ ‘ well, then,’ continued his son, ‘ be just with them, and since  “science and virtue have no other language, leave them im their offices, that  “they may enjoy the pleasures of this world, and afterwards participate in the  “blessings of the other\n",
      "’ ‘thou art right, son!’ interrupted al-hakem\n",
      " ‘ as  “to the objection raised by them,’ continued ’abdu-r-rahman, ‘ respecting  “the scantiness of his means, and his liability to be corrupted, the remedy rests  ‘in thy hands, and thou mayest stop their mouths by a single act of thy wonted  “ generosity\n",
      "’ ‘ and what is that?’ replied al-hakem\n",
      " ‘ give to thy protégé,’  “ answered ’abdu-r-rahmén, ‘ from thy treasury, a sufficient sum to enable him to  “ fill his station with honour ; this will remove all the scruples of thy advisers,  “and will, besides being an action in which none of thy predecessors surpassed  “thee, raise thee highly in the estimation of thy subjects\n",
      "’ ‘ well said,’ ex-  “claimed al-hakem, his countenance suddenly brightening with joy and satis\n",
      "“* faction ; ‘ come to me, i see that generosity is natural to thee; and that the  “ poet was right who said—  ‘the sons of kings are generous and magnificent lords; the smallest  ‘among them is greater than the greatest of his subjects\n",
      "\n",
      " after this, al-hakem ordered ’abdu-l-m4lik ibn habib into his presence,  ‘“and asked him how much he thought would be sufficient for the support of a  “ functionary in that situation; and when the sum was fixed by ’abdu-1-mélik,  “the khalif issued an order on his treasury for the amount; and not only was  “the allowance paid regularly out of the royal coffers as long as the judge  “ lived, but he himself rose high in the estimation and favour of his sovereign,  “‘who gave him a horse out of his own stables, and conferred on him all sorts  “of honours and distinctions\n",
      " and this was certainly a noble and generous  “ action, the merits of which cannot be concealed, nor its memory be obliterated  “by time\n",
      " thus provided with means sufficient to resist the temptations of  “bribery, and having sufficient piety and virtue to avoid the committing of  “acts offensive to god, and the requisite learning to guide him through the  “‘maze of legal decisions, and to inspire him with equitable sentences in all  “ trials and judgments, the new functionary fulfilled his duties in the most steady  “and upright manner, and his legal decisions became so many oracles among  “those of his profession\n",
      "\n",
      "n the first years of the conquest the moslems of andalus were subject to  the payment of those legal taxes designated in the sunnah, and which every  moslem is bound to contribute\n",
      " this, joined to certain customs paid by the  jews and christians, was more than sufficient to meet the expenses of the court  and carry on the government, but in latter times the splendour assumed by  the sulténs of the family of merw4n, their prodigality towards the learned, and  the numerous armies they were obliged to keep constantly on foot, made it  necessary for them to impose new tributes on their moslem subjects, although  every exaction of the kind is expressly forbidden by the text of the law\n",
      " the  amount of taxes thus collected in the time of the sultans of the house of umeyyah  has been differently estimated by various writers\n",
      " the geographer ibnu haukal  says that under ’abdu-r-rahmdén i\n",
      " they amounted only to 300,000 dinars, a  sum which was collected from the principal cities according to their trade and  the wealth of their inhabitants, each contributing a fixed quota towards the making  up of the total sum\n",
      " the contributions thus levied were divided into three equal  portions : one-third was spent in the maintenance of the army ; another went to  pay the salaries of civil officers and judges, and to defray all the expenses of  the administration ; while the remainder was deposited in the coffers of the khali\n",
      "to meet cases of emergency, sudden invasions of the enemy, and so forth\n",
      " but,  in our opinion, this statement is not correct; ibnu haukal can only speak of  the legal tax called zakah,** and not of all the other contributions, or else they  were enormously increased under the reign of his successors, for we are told that  under ’abdu-r-rahmdén al-ausatt*® the sums levied amounted to one million of  dinars every year, and that under his father’s administration they were computed  at seven hundred thousand, which makes more than double the sum stated by  that geographer\n",
      " moreover, the revenues of andalus must have increased in a  still greater proportion under his grandson ’abdu-r-rahman iii\n",
      ", since, in the  words of ibn khallekén, ibnu bashkiwél, and other historians, they are said to  have amounted to five millions four hundred and eighty thousand din4rs,“ without  including in that sum either the duties raised on all articles of sale, or the con-,  tribution called al-mostkhaldss,““ which amounted to seven hundred and sixty-five  thousand dinars\n",
      " but of this more will be said when we come to the reign of  *abdu-r-rahman an-nassir\n",
      "religion—orthodox sects—that of malik ibn ans—when introduced—faquirs—costume of the an-  dalusians—their weapons and equipments in time of war—their eminent qualities—their similarity to  the greeks—their skill as workmen—they teach the africans the useful arts of life\n",
      "ir now behoves us to say something on the manners and customs of the inhabitants  of andalus ; their piety, their aptitude for the sciences, their courage, their gene-  rosity, their wit, and a thousand eminent qualities by which they have become  famous among the nations\n",
      " we shall begin with their attachment to the internal  dogmas as well as the exterior practices of religion\n",
      " this may be said, in a certain  measure, to have been more or less strong according to time and circumstances,  and to have been determined by the religious habits and the conduct of the head of  the state himself\n",
      " however, it must be owned that, with a few exceptions, the  precepts of religion were always held in the greatest awe and veneration, and all  innovations or heretical practices abhorred and looked upon with contempt\n",
      "  indeed, the disapprobation of the people in matters of this kind was so strong,  that we are told by the historians of the time that it would have been a dangerous  thing for any theologian, whatever might have been his birth or authority, to show  the least deviation from the true spirit of religion; and that had a favourite or a  relation of the khalif been guilty of any heretical practice, and had the sultan  countenanced him in it, or not shown in some way his censure, the mob would  have soon penetrated into his strong palace, and, in spite of his body-guard, seized  on their victim, torn him to pieces, or expelled him from the city\n",
      " this was of  frequent occurrence during the reign of the beni umeyyah, as also the pelting  of judges and governors whenever the inhabitants thought that proper justice  was not given to them in their trials, or that they were despotically treated by  their rulers\n",
      "n former times the andalusians, like the inhabitants of syria, followed th\n",
      "sect of al-auzd’ei,' but during the reign of al-hakem, son of hishdm, son of  *abdu-r-rahmdn ad-dakhel, the third sultan of the family of merwadn in andalus,  some learned doctors began to utter legal decisions in conformity with the opinions  of malik ibn ans and the people of medina, whose doctrines soon became known  and spread all over andalus and africa; the change being in a great measure  brought on by al-hakem’s conviction and firmness\n",
      " there are various opinions  entertained as to the reasons which induced the sultan to make that innovation;  the most current being that several andalusian doctors happening to go to medina,  and having become acquainted with the im4m malik, then residing in that city,  and having heard from his own mouth the exposition of his sublime doctrines,  were deeply impressed with their truth, and on their return to andalus began to  spread and preach them every where, expatiating in praise of their master, boasting  of his virtues, his influence, his wide-spread fame, and the high estimation in  which he was held by all classes of the people\n",
      " this having reached the ears of  al-hakem, he held several conferences with them, and the result was that, being  convinced of the purity and advantages of their doctrines, he issued immediate  orders for the establishment of the sect of mélik ibn ans throughout his do-  minions\n",
      " : \n",
      "thers assert that the imam malik having once interrogated an andalusian  doctor, whom he happened to meet at medina, as to the habits and mode of  life of the sovereigns of the house of merwdn, was very much surprised and  gratified to hear that al-hakem led a most exemplary and irreproachable life,  offering a contrast to the conduct of the ’abbasside khalifs, and especially of abi  ja’far al-mansir, who, as is well known and may be read in the history of the  time, was then persecuting the descendants and partisans of ’ali, casting them into  prison, and subjecting them to all manner of ill treatment, for which reason  malik never failed to censure his proceedings: hearing, therefore, of the praise-  worthy conduct of al-hakem ibn hishdém, he is said to have exclaimed in rapture,  ‘god grant that he may be one of ours,” or words to that purport\n",
      "? this wish  having been communicated to the sultén by the doctor in whose presence it was  expressed, they say that al-hakem, who was already informed of the great repu-  tation which his virtues and sanctity had gained him, decided immediately upon  adopting the sect of mélik and forsaking that of al-auzé’ei\n",
      " among the anda-  lusian doctors who contributed most efficaciously to bring about this change, either  by their words or by their writings, are counted ’abdu-l-mdlik ibn habib, yahya  tbn yahya al-leythi, and zey4d al-lakhmi; but of this more will be said  hereafter\n",

      " however, we are  inclined to believe that they never were so numerous as in the east, nor did they  obtain in andalus the same success which they had there, for ibnu sa’id tells us  that it was a general rule among his countrymen not to encourage idleness by  bestowing alms on people capable of gaining their livelihood by labour, and that if  an andalusian happened to meet a strong and healthy man under such a disguise, he  would, instead of giving him alms, abuse him, and, by denouncing him to the  magistrates, have him cast into prison ; this is the reason why beggars were at all  times scarce in andalus,—those, however, always excepted, who, through some  corporeal defect, could not earn their living\n",
      " however, the judgment that we  have passed on the faquirs of andalus must be applied to the generality, not to all,  for there were among them men who, moved by sentiments of piety and devotion,  left the world and its vanities, and either retired to convents to pass the remainder  of their lives among brethren of the same community, or, putting on the darwdzah  and grasping the staff of the faquir, went through the country begging a scanty  pittance, and moving the faithful to compassion by their wretched and revolting  appearance\n",
      " the following anecdote, which we extract from the celebrated work by  ar-ré’ii, entitled ‘‘the book of luminous introduction to the knowledge of those  ‘ qualities which a faquir ought to have,’’® will convey some idea of their customs  and habits\n",
      " ‘‘ it happened once,” says that author, ‘“ that the sherif abd-l-ma’ali,  “son of abi-l-k4sim al-hiseyn, kédi-l-kod4 of granada,® and commentator of  “ the al-khazrajlyeh, and the makssirah’ of hazem, a man not only illustrious by  “his birth,—for both his father and mother were descendants of hasan, and  ‘* consequently of the family of the prophet,—but by his virtues and eminent  “ qualities, renounced at once all his dignities and employments, and gave himself  “up entirely to devotion and abstinence\n",
      " being a man of profound learning and  “* great piety, of amiable disposition and courteous manners, he won the esteem of  “« every one of his fellow-citizens, and became the object towards which the fingers of  ‘the people of this world and of the world to come were universally pointing\n",
      " he  “« had a brother whose name was abi-l-’abbés ahmed, k4di of a town in the eastern  “ districts of andalus, but who was then residing in granada; with him abi-l-  “‘ ma’4li dwelt, but he would never eat any thing in his house because he was in  “the employment of the sultan: he would, whenever he felt hungry, go to his  “« brother, and say to him, ‘ brother, i am hungry, give me a dirhem that i may bu\n",
      "“ food,’ and he used to go to market, and procure such provisions as he most  “wanted\n",
      " in this way he lived for several years, persevering in his resolution,  “and depriving himself of every one of the comforts which the world bestows,  “ until one day he bent his steps towards a convent in the outskirts of granada,  “called zdwiyatu-l-mahrik (the convent of the burnt),® and addressing himself  “to its inmates, whose superior at the time was abi ja’far ahmed al-mahdiid, he  “* said to them, ‘ my friends! i had a lamp to light myself with, and i have lost it,  “so that i cannot see at all;’ and the superior replied to him, ‘o sherif! i cannot  “answer thee, but the first man who happens to come here shall do it to thy  “* gatisfaction\n",
      "” few minutes had elapsed before one of the many holy men who  “‘ used to visit the convent made his appearance, and sat himself by the side of  “ abi ja’far, who addressed him thus,—' brother, this sherif has just now put a  “‘ question to our community, and i have told him that the first man who should  “enter here would answer it for him; so hear what he has got to say, and reply  “to him\n",
      "’ abi-l-ma’éli then repeated his words,—‘ i had a lamp to light myself  “with, and i have lost it, so that i cannot see at all:’ the stranger then said,  “* well, that only shows a breach of discipline, thou must tell me more:’ then  “ abé-l-ma’4li said, ‘i do not remember any fault i have committed, unless it be  “that when so and so incurred the displeasure of the sultan, and concealed himself  “ for fear of the approaching chastisement, i passed one day by his house, and he  “ called me through the wicket of his door, and begged me to pray to god in his  “ behalf, and i said to him—repeat such and such a prayer,—meaning one which  “* contains all the illustrious names of the almighty god, and which is well known  “to be an efficacious remedy against all calamities present and to come; a prayer  “ which is recorded by al-biini in his al-muntekhab,® and has repeatedly produced  “the most miraculous effects, and was communicated to me by my brother ahmed  “ ash-sherif, who had it from one of his disciples\n",
      "’ when the faquir heard this,  “ he said, ‘ and when this took place hadst thou permission to admonish him ?’  “© no,’ answered abii-l-ma’éli\n",
      " ‘well then,’ said the faquir, ‘it is of no use  “asking for thy lamp, thou shalt never recover it, and the light shall never be  “ restored to thee, for thou hast committed a breach of the rules which every  “faquir ought to observe\n",
      "’ and so it happened; for some time after this  “ abi-l-ma’4li returned to the world, and, putting an end to his austerity and  ‘ abstinence, accepted the office of kdédi which was offered to him, and served  “ kings, ate at their tables, and accepted their presents\n",
      " this anecdote is well  “known all over granada, as well as abi-l-ma’éli’s apostacy\n",

      "- “ the inhabitants of andalus,” says ibnu sa’fd, ‘dress somewhat differently  “ from their moslem brethren of asia\n",
      " they have left off the turban, especially  ‘in the eastern provinces; in the western, however, it is still used by people  “of rank and wealth, or those holding situations under government\n",
      "{ thou wilt  “never see in cordova or in seville a k4di or a faquih without his turban; in  ‘* valencia, murcia, and other provinces of the east of spain, on the contrary, it is  ‘* quite common to see men of the highest rank walk about the streets with bare  ‘heads; as to the lower classes, they never use the turban\n",
      " i recollect once  “seeing in murcia one of the most distinguished and respected ulemas of the city  “ appear before the sultén who then reigned in those districts; he wore nothing  “on his head, and his white hair, shining bright among his black locks, had the  “* most ludicrous appearance\n",
      " military officers, soldiers, and men of the inferior  “classes, have likewise left it off, even in the western provinces\n",
      " ibn hid,”  “formerly king of saragossa, and who in our days reduced to obedience the  “greatest part of andalus, never used a turban; i accompanied him in most  ‘of his military expeditions, and always saw him without it\n",
      " i might say the  “same of ibnu-l-ahmar, who is the present ruler of this country\n",
      "* the cloak called taylasdn™ is used by all classes of the people, men of rank  ‘as well as plebeians, so that thou wilt never see an andalusian go out into the  ‘ street without having his cloak on, the only difference being that sheikhs and  “‘ other people of distinction throw their hood over their heads, whilst common  “ people never do so\n",
      " woollen caps are generally used as a substitute for turbans ;  ‘« the colours most worn are either red or green; yellow is reserved for the jews,  “‘ who, on no occasion, are allowed to use any other\n",
      " the hair is cut short, only  “ kaédis and ulemas wear it long; but instead of letting it hang over their  ‘shoulders, as is the fashion in the east, they wear it loose underneath the  “* left ear\n",
      " \n",
      "even the people who use turbans follow a fashion of their own, and seem  ‘entirely to disregard the multifarious shapes used by people of rank and dis-  “ tinction in other moslem states ; so if an eastern arab happens to come among  “ them, wearing a turban in the syrian or hejazi fashion,—and large high things  “they are, looking like towers,—they will show great astonishment, and appear  “much struck with the novelty; but instead of admiring its shape and structure,  * they will burst out laughing, and jest at the expense of the wearer, for in general  “the andalusians are very slow in adopting the fashions of other nations, and  “‘ neither admire nor like any thing but their own\n",
      " they are also the cleanest  “people on earth in what regards their person, dress, beds, and in the interior  “ of their houses ; indeed, they carry cleanliness to such an extreme that it is no\n",
      "“an uncommon thing for a man of the lower classes to spend his last dirhem in  “soap instead of buying food for his daily consumption, and thus go without  “his dinner rather than appear in public with dirty clothes\n",
      "ultans, military officers, and even the common soldiers, followed the fashions hates  of the infidels; in time of war, especially, they wore a dress very similar to in time of war\n",
      "  that of the christians, their neighbours\n",
      " they used likewise the same weapons,  and, like them, were clad in mail, over which they threw a short scarlet tunic,  in the christian fashion\n",
      " they fought on horseback with shield and spear,  but knew not how to use either the mace or the bow of the arabs; instead of  which they adopted the cross-bow of the franks, and used it in sieges, or in  marches, to defend the infantry from the attacks of cavalry, for without that  requisite they would certainly be defeated\n",
      " however, we are informed by ibnu-  l-khattib that under the merinite sulténs, who reigned at granada, the anda-  lusian troops were again clad and armed in the real arabic fashion; instead  of the heavy steel helmet and thick breast-plate of their ancestors, they then  wore a slender head-piece, and a thin but well-tempered cuirass; instead of  the huge spear with a broad end in the christian fashion, they took the long  and slender reed of the arabs, and they substituted for the clumsy and ill-shaped  christian saddle the more military-looking and more convenient horse furniture  of the inhabitants of arabia\n",
      "'\n",
      "he character of the andalusian arabs has been thus described by ibnu ghélib to eminent  in his kitdb > forjati-l-anfus (the book of contentment of the soul), a work to’ anes  which we have more than once referred in the course of our narrative\n",
      " ‘‘ the  “ andalusians,” sseye<he; “ are arabs by descent, in pride, in the haughtiness of  “their temper, the elevation of their minds, the goodness of their heart, and  “the purity of their intentions; they resemble them in their abhorrence of every  “thing that is cruel or oppressive, in their inability to endure subjection or  “contempt, and in the liberal expenditure of whatever they possess\n",
      " they are  “indians in their love of learning, as well as in their assiduous cultivation of  “ science, their firm adherence to its principles, and the scrupulous attention  “with which they transmit down to their posterity its invaluable secrets\n",
      " they  “are like the people of baghddd in cleanliness of person and beauty of form,  ‘celegance of manners, in mildness of disposition, subtilty of mind, power of  “thought, extent of memory, and universality of talent\n",
      " they are turks in  “ their aptitude for war, their deep acquaintance with every one of its stratagems\n",
      "and their skilful preparation of the weapons and machines used in it, as well  “as their extreme care and foresight in all matters concerning it\n",
      " they have  “been further compared with the chinese (by an andalusian author name\n",
      "“‘ tbnu hazm) for the delicacy of their work and the subtilty of their manufactures,  “and their dexterity in imitating all sorts of figures\n",
      " and, lastly, it is generally  ** asserted that they are of all nations that which most resembles the greeks  “* in their knowledge of the physical and natural sciences, their ability in discovering  “‘ waters hidden in the bowels of the earth, and bringing them to the surface ; their  ‘“‘ acquaintance with the various species of trees and plants, and their several  “ fruits, and their industry in the pruning and grafting of trees, the arrangement  “and distribution of gardens, the treatment of plants and flowers, and all and  “every one of the branches of agriculture: indeed, so great is their proficiency  “in this science that it has almost become proverbial, and some eminent  “‘ writers among them have composed works which are generally approved of  “and consulted in the east and in the west\n",
      " such is the treatise on agriculture  “by ibn bassdl,'s an andalusian, which is in the hands of every farmer, and  “the merits of which have been sufficiently appreciated by all those who have  “* followed its valuable instructions\n",
      " the andalusians, moreover, are the most  “* patient of men, and the fittest to endure fatigue ; they are thereby well qualified  “for labour of every description ; they likewise show great inclination for war,  ‘* and have on all occasions proved to be active, brave, and intelligent soldiers}”\n",
      "arious authors have dwelt at large on the great similarity existing between  the andalusian moslems and the greeks, but it is easily accounted for by the  circumstance that the greeks for a long time inhabited andalus, and the moslems  became thereby the inheritors of all their knowledge in the sciences\n",
      "bnu ghélib continues, ‘‘ we may enumerate among the eminent qualifications  ‘of the inhabitants of andalus that of having been the inventors of the species  ** of verse called al-muwashahah, which has not only been approved of by eastern  “ critics, but adopted and used by their poets, and made the theme of public  “ literary competitions\n",
      " as to their poems in the common kinds of metre, and  “their works in prose, nobody who has read them will deny that they stand high  “in the scale of merit\n",
      "the skill of their workmen in all kinds of handicraft has been sufficiently  “acknowledged by travellers from the east, and other mohammedan countries,  ‘‘who have lived among them; many are the articles now manufactured in  “ andalus which are in high repute, and form the staple of considerable trade  ‘with moslems and christians: africa may be said to have derived its present  “wealth and importance, and its extent of commerce, from andalusians settling  “in it\n",
      " for when god almighty was pleased to send down on their country  “the last disastrous civil war, thousands of its inhabitants of all classes and  “* professions sought a refuge on these’® shores, and spread over maghrebu-l-aksd\n",

      "  “labourers and country people took to the same occupations which they had  “left in andalus,—they formed intimacy with the inhabitants, assisted them in  “ their agricultural labours, discovered springs, and made them available for the  “irrigation of their fields, planted trees, introduced water-mills,® and other  “useful inventions ; and, in short, they taught the african farmers many things  “they had never heard of, and showed them the use of excellent practices  ‘“‘ whereof they were completely ignorant\n",
      " through their means the countries  “where they fixed their residence became at once prosperous and rich, and  “ the inhabitants saw their wealth increase rapidly, as well as their comforts and  “* enjoyments\n",

      "the inhabitants of cities being for the most part well educated people, and  “ being versed in all the branches of learning and polite literature, soon made  “themselves conspicuous and known at court, or in the chief towns where  “they settled\n",
      " they filled posts of distinction in the state, and were appointed  “to the charges of wizirs, katibs, governors of provinces and districts, tax  “collectors, and other offices under government, so that there was no district  “in africa wherein some of the principal authorities were not andalusians\n",
      "« but it was in the class of operatives and workmen in all sorts of handicrafts they teach the  “ that africa derived the most advantage from the tides of emigration setting towards etic  “its shores\n",
      " it is well known that before the arrival of the andalusians many  “of the trades which are now in a flourishing state were hardly known in africa,  “and that in activity and dexterity the emigrants ranked far above the native  “workmen\n",
      " so, for instance, if they undertook the building of an edifice they  “ completed it in the shortest possible time, and finished every thing so beautifully,  “and with such a perfection of design, that they won the hearts and affections  “of their employers, and their reputation grew immense among the people ;  “these being notorious facts, which none but the ignorant or the ill-intentioned  “could deny\n",

      " the latter  author himself, making as it were a comment on ibnu ghalib’s words, and recording  some of the good qualities which the andalusians were known to possess, adds as  follows: ‘‘ god almighty knows it is not my intention to flatter my countrymen,  “but mierely to state the truth, following those impartial writers who are neither  “ carried away by the love of their country, nor diverted from truth through envy  “or malevolence ; my motto shall be, ‘ the path of truth is the surest path to  “ follow\n",

      "  ‘when they directed their looks towards leylah, and saw the beauty of  ‘her face, they were confirmed in their belief, and  ‘ they exclaimed, we have still fallen short in our praises of thee\n",

      " yet it is a known fact that the capital of al-maghreb was never so  “ flourishing as under the reign of the beni ’abdi-l-mimen, who took thither  ‘* workmen and operatives from all parts of their andalusian dominions\n",
      " this is  “‘ notorious, and needs no confirmation: the same might be said of the city of  “ tunis, in africa proper, to which in my times the prosperity and splendour of  ““ morocco may be said to have migrated, owing to the present sultan, abi  “« zakariyya yahya ibn abi mohammed ibn abi hafs,’® having fixed his court  “in it\n",

      " accordingly, between algesiras, the place of his landing, and  baldt hamid,’ a place in the furthest frontier, where-the army was then encamping,  palaces were built by ’abdu-r-rahmén’s orders, in which mohammed was duly  received and lodged\n",

      "tn illustration of this i shall here relate an adventure which occurred to me  “‘ whilst in andalus\n",
      " i was once travelling with my father in one of the eastern  “ provinces when we were caught in a storm of rain and wind\n",
      " it was then  “winter, and the cold was intense; the clouds poured down upon us more  “‘ water than the nile itself has in its bed\n",
      " lightning crossed our sight, thunder  “ roared over our heads, we were wet through and perishing with cold, so that  “we determined upon directing our steps to a neighbouring village, and asking  ‘hospitality from the first inhabitant we should meet\n",
      " it must be observed  “that both my father and i were at that time under the jealous vigilance* of  “the sultén, and unprovided with sufficient means to take any other determi-  “nation\n",
      " we therefore went to a house and knocked at the door; the owner,  ‘“‘a respectable old man, whom we had never seen before, soon opened it and  ‘admitted us into his house ; he received us with great kindness, and said soon  “ afterwards, ‘ if you have any money to give me i will buy charcoal and light  “a fire, that you may dry your clothes and warm yourselves; i will also go to  “market and get such provisions as you may want, and my people will dress  “them for you\n",
      "’ we did what we were desired,—we gave him money to make  ‘‘ his purchases, and he soon came back and lighted a very good fire\n",
      " while  ““we were warming ourselves at it, in came a young lad, apparently a son of  “our host, who, approaching the fire, began to warm himself, but no soone\n",
      "“did the father perceive it than he came up to his son, gave him a beating,  “and sent him away from it\n",
      " ‘what dost thou beat this boy for?’ said my  “ father to our host\n",
      " ‘i beat him,’ replied the old man, ‘that he may accustom  “himself from childhood to cold-and privation, and be thereby enabled: to earn  “his subsistence and provide for himself after i am dead\n",
      "’ when it was time  “* to go to bed the old man said to the youth, ‘give that thick cloak* of yours  “to this young man,’ pointing to me, ‘that he may add it to his covering and  ‘sleep more comfortably,’ and he did as desired\n",
      " when i awoke in the morning  “i observed that the youth was also awake and holding in his hands one of  “the corners of his cloak\n",
      " i afterwards communicated this observation to my  “father, who said to me, ‘do not wonder at it, for this is a thing that happens  “every day, and it is in the character of the andalusians to show the greatest  “ “ hospitality and benevolence towards their guests, at the same time that the\n",

      "n another occasion, having been attacked by superior forces, he required all  his courage and ability to extricate himself from his dangerous position\n",
      " the  christians closed on all sides upon him, but instead of losing courage he animated  his followers, and making a most desperate charge against the enemy, penetrated  into their ranks, unhorsed and killed their most valiant knights, and succeeded in‘  disengaging himself, after performing such feats of arms that he himself was  astonished\n",

      " they say that he made  himself so conspicuous by his courage and his prowess against the enemy, as well as  by the forays he made into their territory, that his name was well known to the  meanest soldiers in the christian camp, and that the single mention of it was  sufficient to cast terror into the heart of the stoutest knight\n",
      " in confirmation  whereof an anecdote is told of a christian warrior, who once approached a brook in  order to give his steed water ; when the animal pranced, reared, and would not  come near it\n",
      " ‘‘ what ails thee?” said the soldier, addressing his horse, ‘ hast  thou seen ibn kadis in the water?”*® and this was no doubt a great distinction,  tending to prove the great estimation and awe in which the warrior was held by  the christians, owing to the brilliant feats of arms he was seen to perform on  every occasion\n",
      "he same author from whom we have borrowed the preceding anecdote mentions  another very curious one, which he says he had from a trustworthy friend and eye-  witness\n",
      " ibn kadts once left the frontiers of the moslem dominions at the head  of a small but chosen band of resolute followers, in order to make a foray into  the enemy’s territory\n",
      " however, he soon fell in with a considerable body of the  christian troops, by which he was surrounded, and placed in imminent danger  of being made prisoner\n",
      " but ibn kadtis being a brave and experienced warrior,  and knowing that he could rely on the courage and devotion of his handful of  men, instead of being frightened at the superior numbers of the enemy, rose in  his stirrups, said a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and, putting himself  at their head, plunged into the close ranks of the enemy, which he scattered and  dispersed right and left; thereby opening himself a passage, and disengaging his  small force without the loss of a single man\n",
      " he then began to retire in good order  towards his camp, being closely followed by the christians, but as he was retreatin\n",
      "and fighting, one of his men who had remained considerably behind was unhorsed,  and his steed ran away\n",
      " the soldier then implored the assistance of his captain,  who hastening back to him said—‘‘ wait a moment, and defend thyself on foot  “till i get thee a horse ; ”—saying which, he rode to the nearest christian horse-  man, threw him down at the very first onset, took his steed, and gave it to his  dismounted soldier, who was thereby enabled to join the main body\n",
      " many similar  feats of arms are recorded of this valiant captain\n",
      " \n",
      "ariz ibn ’okkéshah,® of the posterity of \"okkéshah ibn mahiss, the com-  panion of the prophet, is also counted among the bravest warriors that andalus  ever produced\n",
      " he was a man of colossal size and enormous strength, and few  were the warriors whom his arm reached in the heat of battle who ever escaped  with their lives\n",
      " it once happened that adfonsh’® (alfonso), one of the infidel  kings of andalus, at the head of considerable forces invaded the territories in which  hariz commanded, and began, as was the custom in similar expeditions, to burn  the fields, to destroy the farm-houses, cut down the trees, and commit all sorts of  ravages\n",
      " wo sooner was hariz acquainted with the invasion than he dispatched a  messenger to alfonso, with a letter conceived in the following terms :—‘“‘ desist  “from thy work of destruction, and spare misery and calamity to the creatures  “of the almighty, for if it be decreed by him that this country shall be thine,  “there is no need for thee to waste and destroy the land of thy future dominions ;  “ while, on the contrary, if it be written that thou shalt not conquer it, this country  “shall never be thine, even if thou hadst ten times the number of troops now  “under thy command\n",
      "” on the receipt of this letter alfonso ordered his host  to halt and abstain from further ravages ; he, moreover, feeling a great curiosity  to see a warrior of whom he had heard so much, sent him a messenger, requesting  him to come to his camp, and offering to give as hostages for the security of his  person a certain number of noblemen\" of his suite\n",
      " hariz consented, and the  necessary arrangements having been made, he set out for the camp of the christian  monarch\n",
      " on his arrival at medinatu-i-baydhd,'* which is the same as kal’at-rabdh  (calatrava), west of toledo, hariz rode through the streets of that city, and being  a very handsome man, of gigantic size, mounted on a powerful war-horse, and  completely cased in steel, the eyes of the people were fixed on him, for he was  really a beautiful sight to contemplate\n",
      " the inhabitants of the places through  which he passed all came out to look at him, and gazed with astonishment at  the immense size of his body, the muscular strength of his limbs, the beauty and  polish of his armour and weapons, and his majestic and warlike demeanour ; they  moreover told each other tales of his martial exploits and invincible courage\n",
      " on  his reaching the king’s tents, which were not far distant, all the principal nobleme\n",
      " 126 history of the mohammedan [book 11\n",
      "went out to meet him, welcomed and greeted him, and received him with the  greatest courtesy and distinction\n",
      " when hariz was about to dismount he planted  his spear in the earth so deeply and with so much force that the king, who was  present, felt fully convinced, by that act alone, of all the extent of his gallantry  and strength, while all the bystanders were seized with irrepressible fear, and  the countenances of his bravest knights appeared darkened with the terror which  they in vain tried to conceal\n",
      " there happened to be near the camp a large  enclosure,* wherein the king and his knights exercised in manly sports; to this  spot alfonso led hariz, and invited him to take a part in the tournament for which  preparations had already been made, and which was on the point of beginning\n",
      "  “no,” said hariz, ‘the true knight never measures his sword but with those who  “* equal him in strength, and as i maintain that there is nobody among you capable  “ of drawing out this my spear which i have fixed in the ground, i shall not accept  “thy invitation; but if there be any one among you who believes he can do it,  “let him mount and try, and if he succeed i am ready to encounter him, one  “ or ten\n",
      "” no sooner had hariz uttered this challenge, than most of the knights  then present mounted their horses, and began to try their strength, but not one  amongst them succeeded in pulling out the spear fixed by hariz; in vain did they  redouble their exertions and repeat the trial several times, the spear moved not an  inch from the spot where it had been planted by hariz\n",
      " alfonso was not a little  astonished and grieved to see his knights so unsuccessful, but at last he was  compelled to say to hariz, ‘‘ thou art right, o warrior! let us see how thou dost  “‘it;” upon which, hariz, leaping on his horse, galloped to the spot, and with  the slightest motion of his hand tore up his spear, the whole being done with the  greatest ease and elegance\n",
      " all the bystanders remained dumb with admiration  when they saw the performance of hariz, and the king himself bade him approach,  spoke to him graciously, and treated him with great regard and distinction\n",
      "his hariz was likewise an excellent poet,\n",
      "as may be gathered from the following  verses, which he wrote to the kétib abi-l-motref ibnu-l-muthanna, secretary to  tbnu dhi-l-nin, king of toledo\n",
      " as abv-l-motref was once travelling from  cordova to toledo, he happened to pass by the castle of hariz,’* which stands on  the road between those two cities; abi-l-motref lodged at a house outside the  walls, and soon after his arrival sent a message to hariz, asking him for some  wine\n",
      " the message was in verse, and thus conceived \n",
      "o incomparable man! o phcenix of the age! o new moon among the  “ nobles \n",
      "* alas! wine is wanting, and has become as scarce as the ointment of the  “ balsam tree\n",
      "” !\n",
      "and hariz sent him down some, with the following answer, in the same metre  and rhyme :  “*o inestimable pearl ! o thou, the first among the illustrious men of past  ‘* times !  ‘« we have received thy verses resembling a garden refreshed by the gales  “* of eloquence,  “« and we send thee wine as sweet and well-flavoured as thy character and  “* disposition are mild\n",
      "” *®  when al-muktadir-billah ibn hiid, sultd4n of andalus, sallied from saragossa to  the frontiers to oppose the son of radmir, the great christian king, who at the  head of considerable forces had invaded his territory, there happened to be in his  host a moslem of the name of sa’d4rah who performed a feat of arms well worthy  of record\n",
      " both armies, which were equally numerous and well appointed, met in  an extensive plain in the neighbourhood of huesca; the battle was engaged with  great fury on both sides, and maintained with equal animosity during the whole  day, until towards evening the cavalry of the moslems began to give way\n",
      " when  al-muktadir saw this, he ordered into his presence a borderer named sa’ddrah, a  man of tried courage, and equally renowned for his exploits and his experience in  the affairs of war\n",
      " ‘‘ what thinkest thou,” said al-muktadir to sa’ddrah, “ will  “ be the result of this day?” sa’ddrah cast his experienced eye over the plain, and,  shaking his head, significantly answered, “to tell thee truth, o prince! yonder  “signs bode no good ;” and pointing towards the dense iron-clad masses of the  christian cavalry dispersing the light horsemen of al-muktadir, he added, ‘‘ unless  “yonder iron wall be broken by some unforeseen accident, the day will be against  “us\n",
      "” “thou art right,” replied al-muktadir, “things look rather cloudy ;  “ but what dost thou propose to do?” sa’ddérah meditated an instant, and said,  “ among the white tents that cover the declivity of that hill i can easily perceive  “in the centre that of the son of radmir towering above the rest ; if thou grant me  “ permission i will go there in disguise and kill the tyrant with my own hand\n",
      "”  “ well said,” replied al-muktadir ; “ if thou succeed, the favours of thy master shall  “be lavished on thee; if thou fail, the rewards of the almighty will be thy recom-  “pense\n",
      "” sa’dérah then goes to his tent, puts on a dress similar to those used  by christian knights, arms himself with weapons like theirs, and, mounting his  steed, plunges into the thickest of the mélée\n",
      " being well acquainted with the  language and customs of the christians, he had no difficulty, after opening himself  a passage through their thronged ranks, to penetrate into their camp\n",
      " he then  goes to the king’s tent, and having entered it, he sees the son of radmir sitting  upon a throne, completely cased in steel, so that the eyes were the only visibl\n",
      "part of his body\n",
      " he then watches for some time his opportunity, and, pouncing  upon the christian, with a small dagger wounds him in the eye through one of the  apertures in the vizor, and kills him\n",
      " he then leaves the tent, and begins to cry  out at the top of his voice, “‘ the king is killed! the king is killed!” '” and the  news spreading like fire through the enemy’s camp, panic and consternation seize  the christian warriors ; they give way in every direction, and the victory remains in  the hands of the moslems, who never ceased slaughtering until their arms were  tired, and their swords shivered from dealing blows\n",
      "he princes of the family of hiid who reigned at saragossa in the fifth century  of the hijra being continually at war, not only with the christians who surrounded  them on every side, but with their brethren among the moslems during the long  and bloody civil wars which ravaged that country, had naturally numerous armies  in the best order and military discipline, and generals to command them, who, from  their indomitable courage and superior tactics, cast terror into the hearts of the  infidels\n",
      " there were also warriors of tried courage, and unparalleled dexterity in  the handling of weapons, who in single combat with the christian knights never  failed to gain the victory over their adversaries\n",
      " we shall relate here an anecdote  which, like the preceding, we borrow from the writings of ’ali ibn ’abdi-r-rahman  ibn hudheyl, of granada\n",
      " ‘“ al-musta’in ibn hiid, king of saragossa, made upon  “a certain occasion a successful invasion into the enemy’s territory\n",
      " as he was  “* returning to his capital laden with plunder, and driving before him his prisoners  “and cattle, he saw from a distance a strong body of christian cavalry waiting  “in a favourable position, on the road by which he had to pass, to attack  “him\n",
      " when al-musta’in came closer to them, he ordered the captives and  “ cattle to his rear-guard, formed his men in line of battle, and patiently waited  “ till the christians should make their attack\n",
      " the two armies were thus in  “ deadly silence waiting for the signal to engage in battle, when a christian knight  “ of gigantic stature, clad in bright steel, and mounted upon a powerful black  ‘horse, made his appearance in front of the ranks, and challenged the moslem  “‘ warriors to single combat\n",
      " presently a moslem comes out to him, but, after a  “« few blows dealt and parried on both sides, the servant of god is unhorsed and  ‘« killed by his antagonist, the worshipper of the crucified ; seeing which, the infidels  “gave a shout of joy, and the faithful were afflicted and silent\n",
      " elated with-  “* success, the christian knight rode his horse in front of the ranks, and exclaimed,  ““«come on if ye dare, and if one be not sufficient, come three to one, i will fight  “ you all\n",
      "’ these words filled the hearts of the moslems with rage, but none came  ‘* out to fight with the christian, who, proud of his victory, was cantering his horse  “ in front of the two armies, while the air resounded with the deafening shouts of hi\n",
      "“companions\n",
      " in this extremity, al-musta’in, whose heart was deeply afflicted to  “* see the shame falling upon his men, rode up to a captain of his, a man inured to  “battle from his childhood, and who had the reputation of being as brave as he  “« was dexterous in the wielding of arms\n",
      " his name was abi-l-walid ibn kayjin:  “ to him al-musta’in went in his distress, and told him thus,—‘ o abi-l-walid! hast  “ thou seen the arrogance of that christian dog, and the insults he is heaping upon  “the moslems?’ ‘i have,’ replied al-walid, ‘but if my master grant me per-  “ mission to go out against him, i shall soon bring down his pride\n",
      "’ ‘thou hast  ‘it,’ said al-musta’in, ‘and by allah! if thou bring me his head, my gratitude for  “ the service will know no bounds\n",
      "’ having previously announced to the chris-  “ tian that a moslem champion would immediately appear, abi-l-walid retired for  “a moment into his tent ; he put on a cotton shirt, and mounting on a milk-white  “ steed of his, which in swiftness far outstripped the winds, he rode out without  “ any other weapons than a scimitar by his side, and a long whip with a noose and  “an iron ball at the end in his right hand\n",
      " when the christian knight saw his  “ antagonist so whimsically arrayed,—‘ what,’ said he, struck with amazement,  “‘*when a christian challenges the moslems is there not in the whole army any  “ warrior to be sent against him but this groom with his whip?’ upon which he  “burst out laughing, and gave other evident signs of the contempt in which he  “held abd-l-walid\n",
      " however, they rushed furiously against one another; the  “ christian, rising on his stirrups, aimed a dreadful blow at the head of abi-l-  “‘ walid ; he avoided it by suddenly wheeling round his docile steed, and, turning  “as quick as lightning upon his adversary, struck him with his whip, entangled  “his neck in the noose, and, dragging him from his saddle, stretched him upon  “the ground\n",
      " he then dismounted, and, drawing his scimitar, dispatched the  “ adventurous knight, whose gory head he threw at the feet of al-musta’in\n",
      "\n",
      "e need not expatiate any longer on the courage, the endurance, the discipline,  and other military virtues, of the andalusian soldiers: suffice it to say, that so great  were their ardour in the pursuit, and their intrepidity in battle, that they became  almost proverbial in the east, where, according to ibnu sa’id, an andalusian warrior  was synonymous with a brave man\n",
      " it is true that, exposed as their country was  for so many centuries to the furious attacks of innumerable christian nations,  dwelling within and out of its limits, the moslems of andalus found ample  opportunities to display and nurture in that vast field of battle their warlike  inclinations, to evince their ardent zeal for the propagation of islam, and to show  at all times their eagerness to share in the rewards promised by god to the warriors  who fall in battle with the infidels\n",
      " what nation, we ask, among those that  acknowledge the sublime truths contained in the koran, showed a greater zea\n",
      "for religion, more readiness to uphold its tenets, and a greater alacrity to run  to arms and win the crown of martyrdom? ‘what people on the face of the  earth maintained a longer, fiercer, and deadlier struggle than the andalusians,  who for a period of several centuries had to defend foot by foot the land inherited  from their fathers, to irrigate with their blood every inch of ground conquered from  the infidels, and to oppose their stout breasts to the overwhelming forces and  innumerable swarms of the christian nations, quickly succeeding each other, and  pressing onwards like the furious billows of a tempestuous sea? and when at  last they bowed down their necks before the irresistible laws of fate, is there any  one who can blame them for it? no! the impenetrable decrees of the almighty  must needs be executed on his creatures\n",
      " god is great! god is great! there is  no god but him, the merciful, the compassionate \n",
      "o nation on earth is so ‘proud as the andalusians, nor more unwilling to bear  tyranny, oppression, or contempt: indeed their disobedience to their rulers, and  their want of respect and submission to their superiors, have become almost pro-  verbial\n",
      " in illustration of what we advance we shall quote a few anecdotes\n",
      " it is  related of shajé’, a freedman of al-musta’in ibn hid, king of saragossa, that he  once went upon an embassy from his master to alfonso, the christian king\n",
      "  having arrived at medinah sélim (medina celi), where the infidel was then  holding his court, he was soon afterwards introduced to the presence of the  christian monarch, whom he found sitting on a throne of great elevation raised  on the very tomb of al-mansir, and having his wife by his side leaning on him\n",
      "  after hearing his message, alfonso said to him, ‘‘ o shaj4’! i am the king of the  “moslems, and the conqueror of their country: dost thou not see me sitting on  “the very tomb of the bravest and most powerful among their kings?’ when  shaja’ heard these expressions so injurious to his countrymen, he could not restrain  his passion, and he said very spiritedly, ‘if he whose remains lie under that  ‘“‘ marble were alive, and thou sitting so close to him, thou wouldst not say with  ‘impunity things offensive to him, neither wouldst thou occupy long the place  ** thou now art in\n",
      "” ‘ alfonso caught the allusion,” says shaja’, “‘ and flew into a  “‘ most violent passion ; he rose from his seat, intending no doubt to strike me,  ‘but his wife interfered and said to him, ‘ this man is right; why should not  ‘* honour and glory reside in his countrymen as they do in thee ?’\n",
      "nother act is recorded of the hafedh of andalus, the imém of the learned, the  chief of authors, the pearl of the poets, and the phcenix of his age, abi mohammed  ’abdullah ibn ibrahim as-sanhdji al-hijéri,!® the author of the al-mas‘hab (chatterer)\n",

      " after some  parley held with the guards at the gate, which was all of no avail, abii mohammed  addressed one of them and said, ‘‘ if thou do not let me go in, at least acquaint the  “ governor with my presence, and inquire whether it is his pleasure to see me\n",
      "”  “ what !”” said the soldier, bursting out laughing, ‘thou see the governor! dost  “thou think that our lord has nothing else to do but to admit thee to his  “ presence ?””? abii mohammed then retired a little apart, and, taking a reed-pen  and an ink-stand which he always wore suspended at his girdle, he wrote on a  piece of paper the following verses :  “ the illustrious governor of this castle never dismisses from his door the  « people of rank and merit\n",
      "  “« there is now standing on the threshold a man from silves, with an ode  “ which begins thus—  “««t have been possessed with an idea to sing thy praises, and to record thy  “ beneficent actions\n",

      "” he  then ordered one of his pages to take his letter to the governor, and waited outside  for the result\n",
      " when the kéid ’abdu-l-mélik had perused the contents of the letter,  he wondered at it, and said immediately, ‘‘a man from silves, with an ode be-  “ginning thus,—who can it be? unless it be the wizir ’ammér who has risen  “ from the dead, i know of nobody else answering the description,—let him come  “in\n",
      "” abt mohammed was then introduced into the presence of the governor,  who was sitting with some friends; he entered the room, but instead of bowing  to the k4id, or addressing the company, he stood motionless at the door ; seeing  which, the people who were present took him for a rude and ill-bred man; they  tumed their backs upon him, and affected the greatest coolness and indifference : at  last, seeing that he still remained in the same position, one of the company said to  him, “what ails thee, o stranger? why dost thou not enter this room in the  “manner poets and all well-bred people do, and salute the governor as is the  “custom?” ‘i shall neither bow to the kdid,” replied abi mohammed, “ nor  “ pay any attention to you, till i have made you all as angry and out of humour as  “ you made me by keeping me waiting so long at the gate of this castle, and till  “ you tell me who among you is the most favoured by the governor, in order that i  “ may in future, by courting him and gaining his favours, be sure of not receivin\n",

      " al-mansir  then said, ‘‘ there is no servant in my household that i love more than him,  “* (darting on the sclavonian a look by which he was almost annihilated,) but, by  “ allah! justice must be done\n",
      " pass thy shield to thy neighbour, and come down  “before me, that i may send thee where thou mayest meet thy accuser, and be  “ either extolled or depressed by truth\n",
      "” then addressing his sdhibu-sh-shartah,  intrusted with the execution of his private orders,—‘‘ take that wretch, that criminal  “man, by the hand, and lead him together with his accuser before the magistrate,  “that he may investigate the case, and impose on him the punishment he  “* deserves ; and mark well, let the sentence, whether it be imprisonment or fine,  “be as rigorous as possible\n",
      "” the sahib did as he was ordered ; he took both the  parties before the magistrate, and shortly afterwards the complainant appeared  again before al-mansir, and said he had got redress, and thanked him for having  obtained justice through his means\n",
      " ‘ well,” said al-mansir, ‘‘ begone ; justice  “ has been done thee, and thou art revenged; it is now for me to get redress for  “‘ my injury, and to chastise the crimes committed by the people of my household\n",
      "”  upon which he ordered that the sclavonian should be exposed to all sorts of  humiliation and ill treatment, and he was at last dismissed from his service\n",
      "n another occasion there happened to be a lawsuit between his chief eunuch  al-biraki and a western merchant; they had disagreed in some money matters,  and the merchant brought the case before a tribunal\n",
      " however, the eunuch being  at the head of al-mansir’s household, having the entire management of his house  and harem, and possessing the confidence and favour of his master, was, as may  well be supposed, a very influential person in the state, and the magistrate pro-  nounced a decision in his favour\n",
      " the merchant then appealed ; but the magistrate,  thinking that a man of high rank, and holding such an important situation as  al-biraki did, could not be guilty of the breach of faith imputed to him, dismissed  the appeal\n",
      " the merchant, however, was not disheartened, and he resolved upon  having justice, come what might\n",
      " as al-manstir was on a friday riding to the  mosque, the merchant placed himself before his horse, and implored his justice  against al-biraki\n",
      " al-manstir immediately ordered one of his escort to ride back  to his palace, take the eunuch into custody, and conduct him again before the ma-  gistrate, to whom he sent a message enjoining him to look again into the case\n",
      "  the suit was tried, the eunuch convicted, and the merchant redressed\n",
      " al-mansiir,  moreover, was so much incensed against the culprit, that, after depriving him of all  the favours he had previously lavished on him, he dismissed him from his service,  and exiled him from cordova\n",
      "he following act of justice is also recorded of al-mu’atassem ibn samadeh\n",
      "king of almeria\n",
      " when that prince began to build the famous palace which, after  his name, was called as-samddehiyah, the architects, not finding room enough to  execute their plans, seized on some houses and fields adjoining the palace, and  united them to the main building\n",
      " there happened to be among the pieces of  ground thus appropriated by the builders a small orchard belonging to a good old  man, who more than any other resented and opposed the spoliation, on the plea  that the piece of ground did not belong to him, but was the property of an orphan  of whom he was the guardian\n",
      " as al-mua’tassem was one day inspecting his  building, seated in his garden by the side of an artificial rivulet,” which was made  to wind through it, his eyes fell on something floating on the surface of the water,  and which, when taken up by his orders, proved to be a hollow reed, stopped with  wax at both ends\n",
      " when the wax was removed, al-mu’atassem found inside a  scroll of paper, in which the following words were written\n",
      " ‘‘o thou! whoever  “ thou mayest be, into whose hands this scroll may happen to fall, remember those  “ words of the almighty, ‘ this my brother has ninety-nine ewes, and i have only  “ one, and he said to me,—do intrust her to my care,—which i did, but his words  “ proved false, and he deceived me ; there is no god but god !’* thou art a king on  “ whom god has lavished his favours, making thee wealthy and powerful on earth,  “and yet, far from being satisfied, thy ambition prompts thee to covet the property of  “ others; and to add to thy spacious gardens a piece of ground belonging to an  “orphan, thereby committing an unlawful act, depriving a defenceless girl of all  “ means of subsistence, and taking advantage of thy power, and the importance of  “ thy situation, to do what is unjust\n",
      " we shall to-morrow appear in the presence  “ of him who never dismisses the wretched without aid or consolation, nor the  “offended without redress, and then beware of the consequences!” no sooner  had al-mu’atassem perused the paper than his eyes were bathed in tears, and  his heart was possessed with fear at the terrible consequences which this incon-  siderate act of his servants might bring on him in future life; he immediately  commanded that all the workmen employed in the building of his palace should  appear in his presence, and when they were all assembled he interrogated them  as to what the anonymous paper stated, bidding them to expose the case, and  to tell nothing but the truth\n",
      ": the masons then owned the fact, but alleged as  an excuse, that the piece of land occupied by the old man’s garden being absolutely  necessary for the finishing of the palace, the chief architect had deemed it indis-  pensable to seize on the orphan’s property, although unjustly and contrary to  the law\n",
      " upon which al-mu’atassem, violently incensed, exclaimed, ‘‘ by allah!  “sins of this description are much graver in the eyes of the creator than they are  “in those of his creatures\n",
      " let the orchard be immediately restored to its owner\n",
      "\n",
      "and so it was done, although it materially injured the front of his palace, which -  thus remained incomplete\n",
      "e have read somewhere that some of the principal and most learned citizens of  almeria happening to pass shortly after this adventure by the palace of al-  mu’atassem, one of them said to the others, pointing to the spot where the orphan’s  garden stood, spoiling the look of the building, ‘‘ by allah! that orchard makes the  ‘* palace look as if it were a blind man\n",
      "”—‘ thou art right,” answered one of the  company, ‘‘ but in the eyes of the almighty that spot constitutes its greatest  “ornament\n",
      "” it is also related of al-mu’atassem that whenever he cast his eyes  on it, he used to say “‘ i feel as if that empty spot in front of my palace was finet  ‘* than all the rest which is already finished\n",
      "” however, in the course of time the  old man was prevailed upon to give up his ground; for ibn arkim,” who was  al-mu’atassem’s wizir, never ceased importuning the old guardian, and tempting  the orphan, till they consented to sell their property for the price which they  themselves fixed on it; the sultan being thereby enabled to complete the building  of his famous palace, after performing such a signal act of justice as ensured him  the love and esteem of his subjects, and the future rewards of his lord\n",
      "or was al-mu’atassem famous only for such acts of justice as that which we  have just recorded ; he was also renowned for his benevolence and his forgiving  temper\n",
      " it happened once that an-naheli al-bathalidsi, a poet, to whom he  had been a very munificent and generous lord, ‘all of a sudden left his court, and  repaired to that of al-mu’atamed ibn ’abbdd, king of seville, where, regardless of  past favours, and showing the greatest ingratitude towards his former benefactor,  he began to praise the sevillian monarch, who was not then on very good terms  with al-mu’atassem\n",
      " in one of his poetical compositions he introduced the fol-  lowing verse \n",
      " tbnu ’abbdd has every where routed and exterminated the berbers; tbnu  “« ma’n has extirpated the fowls of the villages\n",
      "” *\n",
      "owever, it happened some time afterwards that an-naheli, forgetful of what he  had said, returned to almeria; and no sooner did al-mu’atassem hear of his arrival  than he invited him to an evening repast\n",
      " an-naheli went accordingly to the  palace, where a numerous company was already assembled, and the tables spread, but  they contained no other victuals than a profusion of fowls dressed in various ways\n",
      "  astonished at what he saw, the poet could not help asking if there was no other  food to be procured in almeria but fowls ; when the sultan, rising from his couch,  said,—‘‘ yes, but we wished to make thee pass for a liar, when thou didst say  “that ibnu ma’n had extirpated the fowls of the villages\n",
      "” upon which, an-  nahelf, trying to exculpate himself, said, ‘‘ god has given thee abundance of means\n",
      "“and any one in thy rank of life would have done the same; but thy wrath ought  “rather to be directed against him who heard my expressions and repeated them  “ to thee\n",
      "\n",
      "l-mu’atassem answered nothing, and an-naheli left the room; but thinking  that he had incurred the wrath of the sult4n, he feared for his life, and on his  return home he hastily made a few preparations, and left almeria that same  night\n",
      " \n",
      "owever, some time afterwards an-naheli repented, and wishing to return to  almeria he addressed to ibnu ma’n the following verses \n",
      " tbnu samédeh receives graciously those who deserted him; he pardons  “* crimes which the world after him will not pardon\n",
      "« almeria is a paradise, where every thing which adam found may be  “ procured\n",

      " it is related of the amir al-mundhir,® son of the  sultan ’abdu-r-rahman, that a slave-merchant once presented him with a beautiful  girl, named tarab, who among other accomplishments possessed that of a sweet  voice, and great proficiency in music\n",
      " no sooner had the eyes of al-mundhir  contemplated her charms, and his ears listened to the ravishing melody of her  songs, than he lost his heart, and became deeply enamoured of his slave\n",
      " having  revolved ‘in his mind how he should reward the merchant, he called one of his  confidential servants, and said to him, ‘‘ what dost thou think we ought to give  “this man in return for his invaluable present, for this girl of incomparable  “ beauty ? ’—‘' o master!” answered the servant, ‘‘ methinks the best way would  “be to have her valued, and send him the amount in money\n",
      "”—‘' well said,”  replied al-mundhir\n",
      " a merchant was accordingly consulted on the subject, and  five hundred gold dindérs was the price set upon her\n",
      " when the servant returned to  acquaint his master with the valuation, al-mundhir said, ‘‘ is that the proper reward  “ of a man who has presented us with a girl whose beauty has already captivated  “ our heart, and whose charms have won our affection? are we only to send him  “ the sum thou hast mentioned, a sum which he would undoubtedly have received  “had he sold her to a jewish merchant ?””—‘ certainly,” replied the servant,  “but these merchants are an avaricious and miserly set, and every thing appears  “ inconsiderable in their eyes\n",
      "”—‘‘ never heed that,” said al-mundhir, ‘“‘ we are  “liberal and bounteous, and ought not to stand upon trifles when we intend to  ‘* show our generosity ; take him one thousand dinérs, and give him our thanks fo\n",

      " on the return of a similar occasion the same poet came again to  him, with a poetical composition also in his praise—when one of ya’ktib’s servants  remarked, ‘‘ this importunate fellow fancies no doubt that we owe him some-  ‘* thing, and he comes to be paid\n",
      "” to which the amir replied, ‘‘ let him come ;  ** that only proves that the first visit he paid us was to him an agreeable one, and  “that he thinks well of us; i would not consent, for all the riches in this world,  “that he should alter the favourable opinion he has conceived of us\n",

      "respectine the state of science among the andalusians, we must own in justice state of  that the people of that country were the most ardent lovers of knowledge, as well “\"*  as those who best knew how to appreciate and distinguish a learned man and an  ignorant one ; indeed science was so much esteemed by them that whoever had not  been endowed by god with the necessary qualifications to acquire it did every thing  in his power to distinguish himself, and conceal from the people his want of  instruction ; for an ignorant man was at all times looked upon as an object of  the greatest contempt, while the learned man, on the contrary, was not only  respected by all, nobles and plebeians, but was trusted and consulted on every  occasion ; his name was in every mouth, his power and influence had no limits,  and he was preferred and distinguished in all the occasions of life\n",
      "wing to this, rich men in cordova, however illiterate they might be, encouraged  letters, rewarded with the greatest munificence writers and poets, and spared neither  trouble nor expense in forming large collections of books ; so that, independently  of the famous library founded by the khalif al-hakem, and which is said by  writers worthy of credit to have contained no less than four hundred thousand  volumes,’ there were in the capital many other libraries in the hands of wealthy  individuals, where the studious could dive into the fathomless sea of knowledge,  and bring up its inestimable pearls\n",
      " cordova was indeed in the opinion of every  author the city in andalus where most books were to be found, and its in-  habitants were renowned for their passion for forming libraries\n",
      " ‘‘to such an  “extent did this rage for collection increase,” says ibnu sa’id, ‘‘ that any man in  “ power, or holding a situation under government, considered himself obliged to  “have a library of his own, and would spare no trouble or expense in collectin\n",
      "“books, merely in order that people might say,—such a one has a very fine  “library, or he possesses a unique copy of such a book, or he has a copy of such  “a work in the hand-writing of such a one\n",
      "” of this passion for books al-  hadhrami has recorded the following instance :—‘‘ i resided once in cordova for  “ some time, when i used to attend the book-market every day, in hopes of meeting  “‘ with a certain work which i was very anxious to procure\n",
      " this i had done for  ‘* a considerable time, when on a certain day i happened to find the object of my  ‘* search, a beautiful copy, elegantly written, and illustrated with a very fine com-  “‘mentary\n",
      " i immediately bid for it, and went on increasing my bidding, but, to  “ my great disappointment, i was always outbid by the crier, although the price was  “ far superior to the value of the book\n",
      " surprised at this, i went to the crier,? and  “ asked him to show me the individual who had thus outbid me for the book to  ‘‘a sum far beyond its real value, when he pointed out to me a man, who by his  ‘« dress appeared to be a person of high rank, and to whom on approaching i said,  ‘« « may god exalt his worship the doctor! if thou art desirous of this book i  “will relinquish it, for through our mutual biddings its price has risen far above-  ‘its real value\n",
      "’ he replied, ‘i am no doctor, neither do i know what the  “contents of the book are; but i am anxious to complete a library which i am  “* forming, and which will give me repute among the chiefs of the city; and as  “‘ there happens to be still a vacant place capable of holding this book, i thought  “*t might as well bid for it: besides, it seems to be neatly written, handsomely  “ bound, and in very good condition ; it pleases me, and therefore i do not care  “ how high i bid for it, for, god be praised, my means are not scanty !’—when  “t heard this,” says al-hadhrami, ‘‘i was so much vexed that i could not help  ‘ replying to him, ‘ well, thou art right, means are never abundant except with  “men like thee; and as the proverb says,—he gets the nut who has no teeth\n",
      ">  ‘“‘t, who am acquainted with the contents of this book, and who know how to  “‘ appreciate its merits, am deterred from buying it, and profiting by it, through  «the scantiness of my means, whilst thou, to whom the acquisition of it is a  “matter of perfect indifference, art abundantly provided with money to -pur-  “ chase it\n",

      "otwithstanding the proficiency of the andalusians in all the departments of  science, we are informed that there were no colleges in that country where the  youth might be educated and inspired with the love of science, as is the case in the  east ; there seem to have been instead several professorships attached to every  mosque, and numerous professors who delivered lectures on various subjects for a  fixed salary which they received ; and had it not been so, science could not have  flourished as it did, for learned men among them laboured with all their might in th\n",
      "acquisition of knowledge, disregarding every other consideration or occupation  » from which they might have derived emolument : this is the reason why andalus  produced so many authors who reached the highest degree of superiority and  eminence in the several walks of science, as we shall have occasion to prove  when we review their literature\n",
      " at present it will suffice to say that the  andalusians left luminous tracks in every department of science, which they  cultivated with an ardour and success unparalleled among other nations, with the  exception, however, of natural philosophy and astrology, two sciences which,  although secretly cultivated by the higher classes, were never taught in public,  owing to the prejudices of the multitude against them ; for if a man of the lower  classes were to hear another say, “such a one gives lectures on natural philo-  sophy, or is working on astrology,” he would immediately call him zindtk,* (that is,  heretic,) and the appellation might, perhaps, remain attached to the learned man’s  name during the whole of his life: even the length of this might in some measure  depend upon his prudence or his management ; since the lower classes being once  ill-disposed and prejudiced against him, they would, on ‘the least provocation, pelt  him in the streets or burn his house down, before the head of the state had even  been made acquainted with the offence\n",
      " sometimes the khalif himself, in order to ~  conciliate the good will and affection of his subjects, would order the poor man  to be put to death, and a scrupulous search to be made throughout his dominions,  when all: works on the obnoxious sciences perished in the flames\n",
      " this is even  asserted to have been one of the means employed by al-mansir to gain popularity  with the lower classes during the first years of his usurpation, although, if we are to  believe al-hijéri, he was himself an adept in those sciences, and worked at them  secretly\n",
      " but of this more will be said in the course of our work\n",

      "  as to their sect, they followed at first that of al-auzd’ei, as we have remarked  elsewhere ; but in the course of time they adopted that of malik ibn ans, and  knew no other, this being considered the orthodox profession in the state\n",
      " how-  ever, we read in the historians of the times that people of rank or learning occa-  sionally followed one of the others, and went so far as to dispute about their  respective merits in the presence of their sovereigns, whenever these were endowed  with the necessary penetration, tolerance, and love for the sciences\n",
      " no title was  considered so honourable as that of faquih,—indeed at one time it became such a  high and distinguished one that the al-mulaththamin (almoravides) gave it to  their great amir, whom they wished to extol and distinguish; and the title o\n",
      " ethics and me-  taphysics\n",

      "faquih in the west was, and is even to the present day, considered as honourable  as that of kédi in the east\n",
      " so it was that kétibs, grammarians, and rhetoricians  were generally honoured with that distinctive title, although they might not have  gone through their degrees in the law; for, we repeat, the title of faquih was the  highest and most honourable that could be given to any man learned in grammar,  rhetoric, metaphysics, theology, or jurisprudence\n",
      "ivinity and ethics were always cultivated with tolerable success, but grammar  and rhetoric were carried to the highest perfection amongst them\n",
      " ‘so great is  “the ardour of the andalusians in the cultivation of these two sciences,” says  ibnu sa’id, “and so vast their attainments, that i do not hesitate to say that  “ there are at present, in this country, authors equal in merit and parts to the most  “famous grammarians and rhetoricians in the times of khalil® and sibauyeh,®  ‘‘ who have written works that will pass to future generations, and withstand the  ‘“‘ plows of the destructive scythe of time\n",

      "the moslem inhabitants of andalus being either arabs or mista’rabs,’ their  “ language, as may well be inferred, was no other than arabic\n",

      "“ routes, ports, and principal cities of andalus, the six armies or bodies of arabs who  “ settled in it,’* the number of its provinces, the remarkable points of each of them,  “ the productions of the soil, and every thing else peculiar to this country and not  “to be found in others; a very fine and most valuable work indeed\n",
      " but were  “ there no other thing in favour of this country than the prophecy uttered by the  “ messenger of god when he announced that it would be subdued by his people,  “and described the first conquerors, from whom we descend, as ‘ angels in armour,’  “ as appears in the sacred tradition that we hold from tarif abi hamzah ans ibn  “ malik,'> who had it from his great aunt ummu-l-har4m,'* daughter of malhén,  “and wife of abi-l-walid ’obdédah ibnu-s-s4mah, (may god pour his favours upon  “them all !) which great aunt received it herself from the mouth of the prophet,—  “ that alone would be sufficient to honour and distinguish this our country, and  “make it superior to any other\n",
      " for although i am aware that many doctors  “have disputed the interpretation given to the said prophecy, and will continue to  “do so, and are of opinion that the prophet meant perhaps by it either the island  “ of sicily or that of akritis (crete), although i know the objection will be raised  “that there is no sufficient proof of what i advance, namely, that the prophet  “ meant by his words andalus and no other country, and that early traditions like  “this ought not to be admitted and adopted by prudent people unless they be  “accompanied by manifest and convincing evidence, quite disengaged from the  “ ambiguities of language, and resting upon the testimony of good and honourable  “witnesses ; i, nevertheless, persist in giving to the prophecy the aforesaid in-  “ terpretation, as the proofs, in my opinion, are conclusive\n",

      "* tt is well known to every moslem how our lord mohammed was endowed with  “the comprehensiveness of speech and the cream of delivery, and how god  “ almighty permitted that whatever was revealed to him should be communicated  “with the tongue of eloquence\n",
      " it is likewise a matter of fact that a tradition  “authenticated and handed down from witness to witness is in existence, purporting  “that the prophet said once, ‘ that two bands from among his people would furrow  “ the spray of the seas, and make conquest after conquest,’ and that ummu-l-haram  “having asked him to beseech his lord, the almighty god, to make her one of  “the number, he then announced to her that she would be one of the first con-  “ querors ; and so she was, for she joined the naval expedition against cyprus,  “landed, fought on her mule, and died some time afterwards in the island, (may  “god forgive her!) and certainly no other proof can be required of our lord  “ mohammed’s prophetic mission than this acquaintance with and prediction of  “events before they happened\n",
      " now this conquest of cyprus being the first nava\n",

      "‘ expedition in which the moslems were engaged, it becomes evident that the  ‘‘ warriors who subdued that island, and planted in it the banners of isl4m, were  ‘the same whom the lord’s messenger designated in his prophecy by that word  “ al-awalin (the first conquerors), and that ummu-l-hardm being in their number,  “‘ as the prophet had predicted, she was entitled to be counted among the first con-  ‘* querors\n",
      " from the above-mentioned fact i draw an inference which admits of no  ** contradiction ; for, owing to the eloquence and perspicuity of speech with which the  “‘ prophet was gifted by the almighty, it must be concluded that when he men-  “ tioned two different bands of his people, one of which he specified by calling it  “ the first, there must necessarily follow another called the second\n",
      " this is, indeed,  ‘a question which appertains to the rules of grammar, the construction of nouns,  “‘ with their relatives, and the syntax of numbers, for it is an imperious rule of  “logic that a second should follow the first ; since the first is not the first but with  “ relation to a second, nor the second such but with relation to a first, although the  “ third need not be mentioned unless it be particularly required by the second\n",
      " so  “‘ when our prophet (the lord’s benediction and salutation be upon him!) an-  “nounced two bands of his people, and foretold two naval expeditions, one of  “which was called by him al-awalin (that of the first conquerors), that word  “must necessarily indicate the existence of another band called akharin (the  “ others), and who with relation to the first would have been the second\n",

      " «this point once established, i may easily prove that the conquerors of andalus  ‘were mentioned in the prophecy, since this country was the next which the  “moslems attacked by sea, the naval expedition directed against constantinople,  “‘ and which was commanded by hobeyrah al-fazéri, not having taken place until  “ the reign of suleyman ibn ’abdi-l-malek\n",

      "it is well known that our most illustrious historians among our ancestors, as  ‘* well as among our contemporaries, without one single exception, all, on the  “ contrary, agreeing with me on the subject, have constantly designated authors  “and other learned men by the patronymic of the country of their residence,  “ provided they did not quit it to travel to other lands, but settled and lived in it  ‘“ until the time of their death ; so, for instance, when our historians or traditionists  “ mention those among the companions of the prophet who are distinguished by  “ the patronymic surname of kifiyyin, they will put at the head ’ali ibn abi télib,  “ tbn mas’tid,”® and khodheyfah\n",
      "” ’ali only lived at kiifah for five years and  ‘* some months, and although he had passed fifty-eight years and months of his  “ life both at mekka and at medina, (may god preserve them both!) and had  “« distinguished himself in both those cities, he is placed among the people of  “kiifah\n",
      " the same might be said of the two other less illustrious companions  “above mentioned\n",
      " when they mention the people of basrah they will begin with  “?*ammar ibn hassin,2® and ans ibn maélik; hish4m ibn ’a’mir,?' and abi  “ bekrah ;*? although every one of these distinguished individuals was born, had  “* resided, and spent most of his life in the hejjaz, or in tehémeh, or in the tayef,®  “ his residence in the city whence his name is derived having been but insignificant  ‘« compared with the time he had spent in other countries\n",

      " «in what respects this country i must own that nowhere is that universal  “ proverb, ‘man always shuns the knowledge of his own people,’ ** so applicable  ‘“‘as it is among us; and, as i recollect having read in the book of the gospels,  ** jesus (on whom be peace!) said, ‘the prophet shall not be destitute of honour,  “or protection, but in his own country :’™ nothing is more true, and the saying  “* can be tested by what happened to our own glorious prophet with the koray-  “ shites, who, notwithstanding their mild disposition and gentle manners, their  “extreme forbearance, their quick intelligence, their veracity and honour, and  ‘‘many other qualities in which they surpassed every other people on earth,—  “ notwithstanding they had received from the almighty the most fertile valleys,  “and the best-watered meadows for their habitation,—notwithstanding god had  “« distinguished aus and al-khazraj** by gifts which made them the most eminent  “‘ of mankind,—treated the prophet as is well known\n",

      " near this spot the king let fly a favourite hawk  of his at a partridge, which, rising in the field afterwards called kudyat abt  ’obeydah (the hillock of abt ’obeydah), passed him, and alighted on the thicket\n",
      "  thither the hawk flew in chase of the partridge, and the king followed in quest of  his hawk, until, not seeing him appear, and fearing lest he should be entangled  among the branches and unable to move, the king ordered the thicket to be cleared  away that his hawk might be released\n",
      " while his people were employed in cutting  the underwood, behold! the top of a large and magnificent building was discovered  by the workmen, a most amazing structure, all built with large blocks of stone  joined together with molten lead\n",
      " the king, who was an intelligent and enter-  prising man, immediately ordered an excavation to be made, and the building was  speedily laid open in all its length and breadth; proceeding in their work they  came to the foundations, which they found lying in the water, and resting upon a  stratum of small pebbles, there introduced by art of old\n",

      " this induced many of his subjects to settle in the  neighbourhood, and little by little the city of cordova was built, and the palace  which stood in the middle of it became the abode of the kings, his successors\n",

      " this extraordinary work of art, which took its rise at the lower part of the  “gate, and served at the same time as a bar to the gate and as a knocker, had in  “former times belonged to one of the gates of the city of narbonne, in the country  “of the franks ; but when the amir mohammed” took that city from the chris-  “tians he had it removed and brought to cordova, and placed on the principal  “gate of his palace\n",
      " on a line with this, and looking to the south, there was  “another gate, called bdbu-l-jenndn (the gate of the gardens) ; and opposite to it,  “on a platform overlooking the guadalquivir, two mosques famous for their  “sanctity and the numerous miracles wrought in them, in either of which the  “sultan mohammed ar-r4dhi* used to sit to administer justice to his subjects,  “anxious to gain thereby the abundant rewards of the almighty\n",

      " no sooner did the sultdn see the fruit, which so much  ‘resembled that of his gardens in colour and appearance, and the flavour of  ‘which was equally fine, than he was greatly astonished, and inquired from safar  ‘‘how he had procured it\n",

      ", and under the administration  of his famous hajib, al-mansir ibn abi ’a’mir\n",
      " it is thus described by ibnu sa’id,  who quotes ibnu bashkiwél and ibnu-l-faradhi as his authorities‘ the popula-  “tion of cordova had so much increased,—owing to the great influx of people who  “came from all parts of asia and africa to settle in it, and to the tribes of berbers  “‘ which al-mansir drew from the opposite land and kept in his pay ;—the city  “itself had reached to such a pitch of magnificence and splendour,’ that the  “ suburbs and outskirts teemed with inhabitants, and the great mosque was found  “incapable of holding the faithful who flocked to it from all sides\n",
      " as the  “khalifs palace adjoined the mosque on the west side, al-mansir could not  “extend the building except on the east\n",
      " the first step he took was to indemnify,  “* preparatory to the building, the proprietors of such houses as were to be pulled  “ down with such sums as they chose to fix for their property\n",
      " he called together  “ the owners of the houses, and addressing each of them in private he spoke thus :  “* friend, i want that house of thine; i must buy it from thee, that i may add  “ its site to that of the great mosque: it is a work of great utility, and intended  “ for the convenience of the public\n",
      " thou mayst ask whatever price thou chooses\n",
      "228 history of the mohammedan [book 111\n",
      "“* to have for it, and it shall be paid to thee out of the royal coffers\n",
      "’ every one  “* of the proprietors having agreed to sell his house, not without putting the highest  “* possible price on it, al-manstir gave immediate orders for the payment, and com-  ‘* manded besides that a suitable residence should be built for each of the pro-  ‘* prietors in another quarter of the city\n",
      " al-mansiir addressed himself at length to  ‘* an old woman, who, being the proprietor of a house with a palm tree within the  “ court of the mosque,** obstinately refused to part with it for any sum, unless she  ‘* were provided with another house having also a palm tree; upon which al-  ‘‘manstr issued immediate orders that the old woman’s wish should be fulfilled,  “* should it cost a beyt-mdl ;*° and, accordingly, another house with a palm tree was  ‘* procured for a most exorbitant price\n",
      "* all these difficulties being speedily removed, al-manstir began to build  ‘his addition, in aisles extending all along the mosque, as we have remarked  ‘* elsewhere,*° and the whole, when finished, presented a front of the greatest  ‘* solidity and elegance, the interior being decorated with gold in the most mag-  “ nificent manner; so that in the opinion of all the intelligent in these matters  “the addition built by al-mansiir fell nowise short of those of any of his pre-  ‘‘ decessors, that of al-hakem even not excepted :—the action being rendered still  “‘ more meritorious by the circumstance of christian slaves*' from castile and other  ‘ infidel countries working in chains at the building instead of the moslems, thus  “ exalting the true religion and trampling down polytheism\n",
      " al-mansir built also  “ the great cistern under the court of the mosque,®? and it was he who first caused  ‘“« wax to be burnt in the interior in addition to oil, thus combining the effect of  “ both lights\n",
      "\n",
      "he number of brazen chandeliers, of different sizes, in the\n",
      "mosque, is computed  by some at two hundred and eighty, and by others at two hundred and twenty-four,  without counting those over the gates; and the number of cups containing the oil  at seven thousand four hundred and twenty-five, or according to other accounts at  ten thousand eight hundred and five\n",
      " the leaden supporters® for the cups  weighed four arrobes, and three-fourths of a kintar* of cotton for the wicks of  the lamps were consumed each month of ramadhén\n",
      " the annual consumption of  oil amounted to one hundred and twenty-five kintars, half of which was used during  the ramadhan ; and in this holy month three kintars of wax, and three-quarters of  a kintar of cotton thread used in preparing the wax, were requisite over and above  the usual allowance\n",
      " the great wax taper which burned by the side of the imém  weighed from fifty to sixty pounds ; it burned night and day throughout the month  of ramadhan, and its materials both of wax and wick were so contrived that the  whole might be consumed on the last night of ramadhén\n",
      " the chandeliers wer\n",
      "all made of brass and of different patterns, with the exception of three which were  of silver\n",
      " four greater than the rest were suspended in the central aisle; the  largest, which was of enormous dimensions, hung from the ceiling of the dome over  that part of the mosque where the koréns were kept, and consisted, according to a  certain writer, of one thousand four hundred and fifty-four cups for lights\n",
      " how-  ever, these large chandeliers, each of which consumed nightly seven arrobes or  quarters of a kintar of oil, were only lighted in the last ten days of the month of  ramadhan\n",
      " the total expenditure of oil in all the lamps® about the mosque,  including the addition built by al-manstir, is by another writer estimated at one  thousand arrobes, or two hundred and fifty kintars, of which seven hundred and  fifty were consumed in the month of ramadhén\n",
      "bnu sa’id, who borrowed most of his information from ibnu bashktwél, gives  an estimate somewhat different from that of the former writers we have quoted,  although it nearly agrees with that of the latter\n",
      " he says that the annual expen-  diture was one thousand and thirty arrobes of oil, (two hundred and fifty-one kintars  and one quarter,) five hundred of which were spent during ramadhan, and that the  three silver chandeliers required seventy-two pounds weight of oil nightly, that is to  say, twenty-four each ; that the largest of all the lamps measured fifty spans in cir-  cumference, and held one thousand four hundred and eighty cups, the whole of which  were washed over with gold\n",
      " ibnu sa’id being an author more deserving of credit  than any other of those who have written on the subject, not only on account of  the sources from which he derived his information, but also on account of his  veracity as an historian, we do not hesitate to adopt his computation\n",

      "  he adds likewise that four ounces of ambergris, and eight of fresh aloe wood, were  burnt by way of incense on the last day of the month of ramadhdn, although  ibnu-l-faradhi, an author also entitled to great credit, states that one pound of  wood of aloes, and a quarter of a pound of amber, were allowed every friday for a  similar purpose\n",
      "ur readers must have observed some discrepancy in the dimensions of this  mosque, as well as in the number of columns, pillars, and chandeliers which it  is said to have contained, but this is owing either to the inequality of the measur\n",

      "employed, the dhara’ cubit not being the same every where, or to the circumstance  that some authors only counted the detached columns, while others reckoned them  all, large and small, entire and half ;—that some described it before the great ad-  dition made by al-mansir, while others, as ibnu sa’id, visited it as late as the  sixth century\n",
      " in abridging the accounts of the various authors who have treated  on this mosque, we may have been guilty of repetition, yet, as we consider that  information may have been increased by it, and that we have been useful, this will  easily atone for our faults\n",

      "we cannot leave the description of this sumptuous building, and the enumeration  of the wonders of art contained in it, without taking notice of two or three circum-  stances which we have seen mentioned in eastern authors, and which it may be  important to know, although no good authority is given for them\n",
      " it is a current  opinion in damascus, as well as in other cities of the east, that the mosque of  cordova had three hundred and sixty arches, according to the number of days in the  year, and that the sun passed every day by one of the arches until it went round the  whole number, when it returned in the inverse direction\n",
      "*® among the authors that  we have quoted none has alluded to this; nay, we will say more, among the almost  innumerable andalusian as well as african writers who have treated on this mosque,  none, that we know of, has made the least allusion to it; therefore the account,  from whoever it comes, is entitled to no credit ; for, we ask, is it probable that so  extraordinary a circumstance should have been passed in silence by writers who  have recorded facts of much less importance with the most scrupulous details \n",
      "he author of the nashaku-l-azhdr®® (sweet odour of the flowers) says that  among the manifold objects which by their exquisite workmanship or their costly  materials attracted the eyes of the beholder in the mosque of cordova, there were  three red marble pillars, on which were engraved,—on one the name of mohammed,  on the other moses’ rod and the sleepers of the cave, and on the third noah’s  crow ; and that the columns were not the work of man, but made by god, just as  they were\n",
      " we again confess that we have looked in vain for information re-  specting this wonderful production of nature ; in vain have we perused and consulted  the best authenticated accounts of the time, and the most detailed description of the  mosque ; we have nowhere found the least mention made of it: we must therefore  pronounce it improbable ; for is it natural that the best and most diligent among  ancient writers should have omitted the fact, and that if the name of our holy  prophet had been found impressed by the hand of the almighty on one of the  columns of the temple this miraculous circumstance should have been left un-  noticed? but god is all-knowing\n",
      "here is still another circumstance told of the mosque of cordova which we mus\n",
      "mention\n",
      " it is recorded by that eminent writer, ibnu bashkiwaél, whose narrative  we have used so often ; but, being as devoid of foundation as the preceding, no great  reliance can be placed on it\n",
      " that author introduces among his traditional stories  respecting cordova the following :—‘‘ and they say that the site occupied by the  “ great mosque was formerly a great hollow, wherein the inhabitants used to throw  “ their offal, but that when suleyman, son of datid, (on whom be peace !) came to  “ cordova and saw the spot, he said to the jinn, ‘ clear away this place for me,  “and transform it into a suitable ground, that you may afterwards build on it a  “temple for the worship of the almighty god;’ and that the orders were obeyed,  “and the mosque built\n",
      "” but this is contradictory of what we have stated elsewhere  respecting the christian church, which, in the opinion of all writers, and of ibnu  bashktiw4l himself, stood on the site now occupied by the great mosque\n",
      " the  same writer states that all the uniform ovals which are engraved on the ceiling of  the great mosque bore inscriptions appropriate to the spot, and calling the mind of  the faithful to contemplation and devotion\n",

      " it stood at the distance of four miles and a third from  “ cordova; it measured two thousand seven hundred cubits in length from east  “ to west, and the breadth from north to south was one thousand seven hundred  “cubits\n",
      " the number of columns in the building amounted to four thousand  “three hundred, and that of the doors to fifteen thousand\n",

      " eleven hundred burden\n",

      "  another well informed writer says that the cost of every block of marble brought  to cordova, either from the khalif’s dominions in andalus as well as in africa, or  from various distant countries in the hands of the infidels, was ten gold dinars  each, exclusive of the expenses of detachment from the quarry and carving, and  exclusive also of the cost of the men and beasts employed in the transport\n",
      " and  another writer asserts that the total amount of expenses in building the city of  az-zahr4 was one hundred mudd full of dirhems of the measure used at cordova ;  others say eighty mudd and seven kaftz of the same measure\n",
      "® but as these authors  do not state whether this is to be understood merely of the constructions raised  in an-néssir’s time, or also of those continued by his son al-hakem, no great  reliance can be placed on the calculations, especially when we consider the au-  thenticity of the sources whence ibnu hayy4n borrowed the preceding narrative\n",
      "  but before proceeding any further we deem it necessary again to remind the  reader of the system of composition we have adopted for the present work, and  which renders it necessary that we should quote literally from the writings of  authors from every country and of every age, thereby falling at every step into  fastidious repetitions and unavoidable contradictions; for since it is not given to  every author to see things in their true light, or to select the best information,  some have themselves been led into error, and made hundreds fall after them,  while others are to this day like a bright lamp which guides the studious through  the intricate maze of antiquity\n",
      " we, therefore, who have neither the talents  required for the task of historian, nor the books’ sufficient to select and compar\n",
      " 236 history of the mohammedan [book 111\n",
      "our information, have preferred this method of writing history; sometimes quoting  the very words, and at other times extracting the narrative, of authors, but seldom  introducing observations of our own, unless the contradiction be so glaring, or the  statement so uncommon, as to require it\n",
      " we hope therefore that our reasons  for doing so will be justly appreciated, and that our readers will excuse us when-  ever we happen to fall into the above-mentioned errors\n",
      "he two foun- among the wonders of az-zahr4, says ibnu hayy4n, were two fountains, with a  their basins, so extraordinary in their shape, and so valuable for their exquisite  workmanship, that, in the opinion of that writer, they constituted the principal  ornament of the palace\n",
      " the larger of the two, which was of gilt bronze, and  most beautifully carved with basso-relievo representing human figures, was brought  to the khalif from constantinople by ahmed al-yiindni (the greek), and rabi’ the  bishop\n",
      "'° as to the small one, which was of green marble, it was brought from  syria by the said ahmed, although others assert that it came likewise from  constantinople with rabi’\n",
      " however, all agree in saying that such were the  taste of the designs on these fountains, and the magnificence of the materials,  as to make their value almost beyond estimation\n",
      " the smaller one, above all,  appears to have been a real wonder of art\n",
      " it was brought from place to place  until it reached the sea shore,\" when it was put on board a vessel and conveyed  to andalus\n",
      " when the khalif received it he ordered it to be placed in the dor-  mitory of the eastern hall called al-minis,7 and he fixed on it twelve figures  made of red gold, and set with pearls and other precious stones\n",
      " the figures,  which were all made in the arsenal’ of cordova, represented various animals ;  as for instance one was the likeness of a lion, having on one side an antelope,  and on the other a crocodile; opposite to these stood an eagle and a dragon ;  and on the two wings of the group a pigeon, a falcon,* a peacock, a hen, a  cock, a kite,'® and a vulture\n",
      " they, moreover, were all ornamented with jewels,  and the water poured out from their mouths\n",
      "he hall of the another of the wonders of az-zahré was the hall called kasru-l-kholafé (the hall  of the khalifs), the roof of which was of gold and solid but transparent blocks of  marble of various colours, the walls being likewise of the same materials\n",
      " in the  centre of this hall, or, according to some, on the top of the above-described foun-  tain, which is by them placed in this hall, was fixed the unique pearl presented to  an-nassir by the greek emperor leo,'* among other valuable objects\n",
      " the tiles  that covered the roof of this magnificent hall were made of pure gold and silver,  and, according to ibnu bashkiwdl, there was in the centre of the room a large  basin filled with quicksilver; on each side of it eight doors fixed on arches’” of  ivory and ebony, ornamented with gold and precious stones of various kinds, restin\n",
      "upon pillars of variegated marble and transparent crystal\n",
      " when the sun pene-  trated through these doors into the apartment, so strong was the action of its  rays upon the roof and walls of this\n",
      " hall that the reflection only was sufficient to  deprive the beholders of sight\n",
      " and when an-ndssir wished to frighten any of the  courtiers that sat with him, he had only to make a sign to one of his sclavonians to  set the quicksilver in motion,!® and the whole room would look in an instant as if  it were traversed by flashes of lightning ; and the company would begin to tremble,  thinking that the room was moving away,—this sensation and their fears continuing  as long as the quicksilver was in motion\n",
      " the abundance of quicksilver in spain  made an-ndssir conceive the idea of employing it in the manner above described ;  and it was perhaps the effect produced by that mineral which led to the belief that  this hall was perpetually turning round and followed the course of the sun, or, as  others have it, that it moved round on the reservoir as on a pivot ;? and such  was an-ndssir’s care for this building that he would commit the superintendence of  it to none other but to his son and successor, al-hakem\n",
      " in one thing, however,  we find all authors agree, namely, that there never was built a more splendid hall  than this, either in the times preceding isl4m or afterwards\n",

      " in order, therefore, not to be hindered and disturbed in the study  and cultivation of science, which made the principal business of their lives, they  fled before the persians, their enemies, and migrated to andalus, where they had  no sooner arrived than they began to dig canals, and to make cuts from the rivers  for the purpose of irrigation ; to erect bridges and aqueducts, to construct fortresses  and castles, to plant gardens and vines, and to build cities and towns; ploughing  and sowing the land, and raising whatever buildings were deemed necessary for  the pleasure and comfort of the people\n",

      " in  order better to gain their object they began consulting the stars, and found that  by two nations only were they to be disturbed in their enjoyments, and to be hate\n",

      " as\n",
      " people unaccustomed to  the luxuries of life, hardened by privation and fatigue, in short—the arabs and  berbers\n",
      " when the greeks heard of this prognostic they were struck with fear,  and trembled for their populated island ; they agreed upon constructing immediately  a talisman that should avert their impending ruin, and by its power keep off the  two nations mentioned in the prophecy, to which effect they began consulting  the stars for a time and place fit for their undertaking\n",
      " in the meanwhile, when-  ever some of the scattered tribes of berbers inhabiting along the northern coast of  africa happened to approach the sea shore, being thus separated only from andalus  by a narrow channel, the fears and consternation of the greeks would increase,  they would fly in all directions for fear of the threatened invasion, and their dread  of the berbers waxed so great that it was instilled into their nature, and became in  after times a prominent feature in their character\n",
      " on the other side, the berbers  having been made acquainted with this ill-will and hatred of the people of an-  dalus towards them, hated and envied them the more, this being in a certain  measure the reason why even a long time afterwards a berber could scarcely be  found who did not most cordially hate an andalusian, and vice versa, only that  berbers being more in want of andalusians than these are of them, owing to  certain necessaries not to be procured in africa, and which are imported from  andalus, a communication has necessarily existed between the people of both  countries\n",
      " but to return\n",
      " \n",
      "here was in the west of andalus a grecian king, who reigned over an island  called the island of kadis (cadiz)\n",
      " this king had a daughter of incomparable  beauty, whom the other kings of andalus,—for that country was then ruled by several  kings, each having estates not extending over more than one or two cities,—sought  in marriage\n",
      " each of these kings sent accordingly his messengers to cadiz, and asked  for the hand of the beautiful daughter\n",
      " her father, however, unwilling to choose  among so many pretenders, lest by favouring one he should offend the others, was  very much perplexed, and sent for his daughter to acquaint her with the state of his  mind\n",
      " now it happened that the daughter of this king was possessed of much  wisdom as well as beauty, for among the greeks both men and women were born  with a natural instinct for science; this having led to that common saying, that  ‘* science came down from heaven and lodged itself in three different parts of man’s  “ body; in the brains amongst the greeks, in the hands amongst the chinese,  “and in the tongue among the arabs\n",
      "” this daughter, then, having heard the  whole of the case, said to her father, ‘‘ only do what i will tell thee, and do not  “ trouble thyself any more about this matter\n",
      "”—‘ what is thy advice then? ’—  “‘ that to those who solicit my hand thou shouldst answer, that i will give th\n",

      " when the lovers read the letters  containing the princess’s intentions, many who could not lay any claim to science  immediately desistéd from their courtship ; two kings only being found among her  numerous admirers who professed themselves sages, and who immediately answered  his letters, each saying of himself, ‘‘ i am a sage king\n",
      "” ‘when the father got  these letters, he sent for his daughter, and, informing her of their contents, ‘‘ see,”  said he, ‘“ we are still in the same difficulty as before; for here are two kings who  ‘* both call themselves sages, and if i choose one i shall make an enemy of the  “other\n",
      " what dost thou propose to do in such a difficulty?” the daughter  replied, ‘‘ i will impose a task upon both kings, and whichsoever of the two executes  ‘it best, he shall be my husband\n",
      "”—“ and pray, what is it? ’—‘‘ we want in  “ this town a wheel to draw up water ; i will ask one of them to make me one that  ‘‘ shall be moved by fresh running water coming from yonder land; and i will  ‘‘intrust the other with the construction of a talisman or charm to preserve this  ‘island from the invasions of the berbers\n",
      "\n",
      "he king was delighted with the plan suggested by his daughter, and, without  bestowing any more consideration on the subject, wrote to both the princes, making  them acquainted with his daughter’s ultimate determination; and each having  agreed to undergo the intended trial, they set to work as soon as possible\n",
      " the  king to whose lot it had fallen to construct the hydraulic machine * erected an  immense building, with large stones placed one upon the top of another, in that part  of the salt sea which separates the island of andalus from the continent; and in the  spot known by the name of strait of ceuta\n",
      "*® this arched building, which was  built entirely of free-stone, the interstices of which were filled by the architect with  some cement of his own composition, connected the island of cadiz with the main  land\n",
      " traces of this work are still visible in that part of the sea which divides  ceuta from algesiras,“° but the greatest part of the inhabitants of andalus assign it  another origin, as i have already explained elsewhere ; they suppose it to be the  remains of a bridge which alexander ordered to be constructed between ceuta\n",
      " and  algesiras : but god only knows which of the two reports is the true one, although  i find the last of the two more generally believed\n",
      " however, when the architect _  had finished his work of stone, he conducted fresh water from the top of a high  mountain on the continent to the island, and making it afterwards all fall into a  basin, he caused it to rise again in andalus by means of a wheel\n",
      "*\n",
      "s to the other king, whose task was the construction of the magic spell, he first  consulted the skies in quest of a proper and fit time to commence its fabrication \n",
      "and when he had discovered it, he began to build a square edifice\n",
      " the materials  were of white stone, and the place chosen for its erection a sandy desert on the sea  shore\n",
      " in order to give sufficient solidity to the building, the architect sunk the  foundations as deep into the earth as the building itself rose above the surface ;  and when he had completed it, he placed on the top a statue of melted copper and  iron, mixed together by dint of his science, to which he further gave the look and  appearance of a berber, with a long beard ; his hair, which was exceedingly coarse,  stood upright on his head, and he had besides a tuft hanging over his forehead\n",
      "“? his  garment consisted of a tunic, the ends of which he held on the left arm; he wore san-  ‘ dals on his feet, and the most extraordinary thing about him was that, although the  dimensions of the figure were excessive, and he stood up in the air at a distance  of more than sixty or seventy cubits, no other support was seen but the natural one  at his feet, which were at most one cubit in circumference\n",
      " he had his right  arm extended, and in his hand were visible some keys with a padlock ;* with his  right hand he pointed towards the sea, as if he were saying, “ no one is to pass  “ this way ;” and such was the magic virtue contained in this figure, that as long  as it kept its place, and held the keys in its hand, no ship from barbary could ever  sail into the strait, on account of its stormy and fearful waters\n",
      "\n",
      "owever, each of the kings worked with uncommon activity at his task,  hoping that whichsoever of the two accomplished his first stood a good chance of  gaining the heart of the princess\n",
      " the constructor of the aqueduct was the  first to finish his, for he contrived so as to keep it secret from the other, in hopes  that if he did his work first, the talisman would not be completed, and the  victory would remain to him: and so it happened, for he measured his time so well,  that on the very same day on which his rival’s work was to be accomplished water  began to run in the island, and the wheel to move; and when the news of hi\n",
      " success reached his competitor, who was then on the top of the monument giving  the last polish to the face of the figure, which was gilt, he took it so much to heart  that he threw himself down, and fell dead at the foot of the tower; by which means  the other prince, freed from his rival, became the master of the lady, of the wheel,  and of the charm\n",
      "he author from whom the preceding narrative is borrowed does not acquaint  us in what manner the spell acted against africans, nor how its virtue came to be  impaired, but we here subjoin another writer’s version of this story\n",
      "n times of old the greek kings who reigned in andalus were terribly afraid of  an invasion on the part of the berbers, on account of the prophecy that we have  recorded\n",
      " to avoid this they constructed different spells, and, among others, one  which they put inside a marble urn and placed in a palace at toledo: in orde\n",

      "to ensure its custody and preservation they placed a padlock on the gate of the  palace, leaving instructions for every succeeding king to do the same\n",
      " this injunc-  tion having been faithfully complied with, it came to pass that after the lapse ofa  great many years twenty-seven padlocks were appended to the gate of the building,  that number of kings having reigned in andalus, each of whom had put his  padlock as ordained\n",
      " some time previous to the invasion of the arabs, which, as is  well known, was the cause of the overthrow of the gothic dynasty and of the entire  conquest of andalus, a king of the goths, roderic by name,** ascended the throne\n",
      "  now this king, being young and fond of adventure, once assembled his wizirs,  great officers of the state, and members of his council, and spoke to them thus :—  “t have been thinking a long time about this house with its seven-and-twenty  “ padlocks, and i am determined to have it opened, that i may see what it contains,  ‘« for i am sure it is a mere jest\n",
      "” ‘‘ it may be so, o king!” answered one of the  wizirs ; ‘‘ but honesty, prudence, and policy demand that thou shouldst not do it;  “ and that, following the example of thy father, of thy grandfather, and of thy  “ ancestors,—none of whom ever wished to dive into this mystery,—thou shouldst  “add a new padlock to the gate\n",
      "” when the wizir had done speaking, roderic  replied,—‘* no: i am led by an irresistible impulse, and nothing shall make me  “ change my resolution\n",
      " i have an ardent wish to penetrate this mystery, and my  “ curiosity must be satisfied\n",
      "” ‘‘ o king! answered the wizirs, “if thou doest it  “under a belief that treasures are concealed in it, let us hear thy estimation of  ‘them, and we will collect the sum among ourselves and deposit it in thy royal  “ treasure, rather than see ourselves and thee exposed to frightful calamities and  “‘ misery\n",
      "” but roderic being a man of undaunted spirit, stout of heart, and  strong of determination, was not easily persuaded\n",
      " he remained deaf to the  entreaties of his counsellors and proceeded immediately towards the palace, and  when he arrived at the gate, which, as we have already observed, was furnished  with several locks, each of them having its key hanging to it, the gate was  thrown open, and nothing else was to be seen but a large table made of gold  and silver and set with precious stones, upon which was to be read the following  inscription :—‘‘ this is the table of suleyman, son of datid, (upon whom be  “* peace!)” another object, besides the table, was to be seen in another apartment  of the palace, provided\n",
      " also with a very strong padlock, which being removed  * allowed roderic to look into it\n",
      " but what was his astonishment on entering the  apartment when nothing was to be seen but the urn, and inside it a roll of  parchment and a picture representing in the brightest colours several horsemen  looking like arabs, dressed in skins of animals, and having, instead of turbans,  locks of coarse hair; they were mounted 'on fleet arabian steeds, bright scimitar\n",
      "hung by their sides, and their right hands were armed with spears\n",
      " roderic ordered  his attendants to unroll the parchment, when lo! what did he see but the following  inscription written in large letters upon it :—‘‘ whenever this asylum is violated, and  “ the spell contained in this urn broken, the people painted on this urn shall invade  “ andalus, overturn the throne of its kings, and subdue the whole country\n",
      "”*  they say that when roderic read this fatal prognostic he repented of what he had  done, and was impressed with a strong belief of his impending ruin\n",
      " he was not  mistaken, for tidings soon reached him of an army of arabs, which the emperor of  the east sent against him\n",
      "his is the enchanted palace and the picture to which roderic is said to have  alluded afterwards, on the day of the battle of guadalete, when, as he was advancing  upon the moslems, he saw for the first time\n",
      " before his eyes the very men whose  representations were upon the parchment\n",
      " of this more will be said hereafter\n",
      "  but whether this account is a true one or not, god only knows, for we find it  related in various ways by the historians, as we shall have further occasion to  observe when we come to, treat about the famous table of suleyman and other  particulars connected with this case, and that we shall do by taking our information  from the best and purest sources\n",
      " as to the other story, namely, that of the sage  king making a contrivance to bring sweet water from africa into andalus, it is  scarcely credible, for andalus happens just to be one of the countries most  abounding in waters and rivers ; and therefore we do not see the necessity of  bringing water from the opposite shore, unless, as some pretend, the princess only  did it to puzzle her admirer and try his skill by imposing upon him this extra-  ordinary and most difficult task\n",

      "no sooner did ily4n, the lord of ceuta, arrive safely in his dominions, than he  went to see the amir misa ibn nosseyr, and proposed to him the conquest of  andalus, which he described as a country of great excellence and blessings ; he  told him that it was a land abounding in productions of all kinds, rich in grain  of all sorts, plentiful in waters renowned for their sweetness and clearness; he  proceeded afterwards to draw the picture of the inhabitants, whom he affirmed  to be enervated by long peace, and destitute of arms\n",
      "! this account awakened  the ambition of the amir, who, after a mature deliberation on the proposition  made to him, came to the following agreement with ily4n,—that he should desert  the cause which he was then defending? and pass over to the moslems, and that  by way of proving his enmity towards his own countrymen, professing the same  religion as himself, he should first of all make an incursion into their country\n",

      "o sooner did the news of this first expedition, which took place at the close  of the year ninety,* become known in africa, than a great many moslems flocked  under the banners of ily4n and trusted him\n",

      " when misa heard of it he praised god for the  victory he had granted his servants, and strengthened himself in his intention of  invading andalus ; to this effect he called a freed slave of his, to whom he had on  different occasions intrusted important commands in his armies, and whose name  was tarik ibn zeydd ibn ’abdillah, a native of hamdan, in persia, although some  pretend that he was not a freedman of misa ibn nosseyr, but a free-born man of the  tribe of sadf,?° while others make him a mauli?! of lahm\n",

      "hey say that while he was staying in cordova he wrote to the sons of wittiza  to come and join him against the common enemy ; for although it is true, as we  have already related, that roderic had usurped the throne of their father and perse-  cuted the sons, yet he had spared their lives ;—since these two sons of wittiza are  the same who, when térik attacked the forces of king roderic on the plains of  guadalete, near the sea, turned back and deserted their ranks, owing to a promise  made them by térik to restore them to the throne of their father if they helped  him against roderic\n",
      " however, when roderic arrived in cordova, the sons of  wittiza were busily engaged in some distant province collecting troops to march  against the invaders, and he wrote to them to come and join him with their forces, ee  in order to march together against the arabs; and, cautioning them against the  inconvenience and danger of private feuds at that moment, engaged them to join  him and attack the arabs in one mass\n",
      " the sons of wittiza readily agreed to  roderic’s proposition, and collecting all their forces came to meet him, and  encamped not far from the village of shakandah, on the opposite side of the river,°*  and on the south of the palace of cordova\n",
      " there they remained for some time,  not daring to enter the capital or to trust roderic, until at last, having ascertained  the truth of the preparations, and seeing the army march out of the city and him  with it, they entered cordova, united their forces to his,*? and marched with him  against the enemy, although, as will be seen presently, they were already planning  the treachery which they afterwards committed\n",
      " others say that the sons of  wittiza did not obey the summons sent them by the usurper roderic ; on the con-  trary, that they joined térik with all their forces: but which of these reports is the  true one god only knows\n",
      " however, it seems to have been ascertained that all the  princes of the goths came to join roderic in this expedition, although it is equally  true that he was deserted by some of his noblemen on the field of battle\n",
      " but  much obscurity prevails in the writings of the historians who have recorded the  events of those early times\n",
      " even the name of the gothic monarch at the time of  tarik’s invasion has been spelt in different ways, for we find it written thus,—  rudheric, and ludheric ; although the latter is more commonly used\n",
      " it is also  stated that he was a descendant from isbahdn (hispan);*' but this is contrary to the  accounts of ibnu hayydn and others, who say that he was not of royal blood\n",

      " musa,  who since ta4rik’s departure for this expedition had been employed in building ships,  and had by this time collected a great many, sent by them a reinforcement of five  thousand moslems, which, added to the seven thousand of the first expedition, made  the whole forces amount to twelve thousand *? men, eager for plunder and anxious  for battle\n",
      " tlyén, lord of ceuta, who had become a tributary of the moslems, was  also sent with his army and the people of his states to accompany this expedi-  tion, and to guide it through the passes in the country, and gather intelligence  for them\n",

      " they offered to desert, and pass over to térik with the troops under their  command, on condition that the arab general would, after subduing the whole of  andalus, secure to them all their father’s possessions, amounting to three thousand  valuable and chosen farms, the same that received after this the name of safdyd-l\n",

      " the moslems proceeded gently and unnoticed till  they arrived on the banks of the river,® which they crossed, finding themselves then  at a distance of only thirty cubits, or perhaps less, from the walls\n",
      " owing to the  squalls of rain, and the cold of the night, the sentries, neglecting their duties, were  not on the walls keeping guard, a circumstance which allowed the moslems to arrive  unheard and unmolested at the foot of the battlements; they then attempted to  scale the walls, but failed in their attempt by not finding a place to fix the  ladders\n",

      " accordingly, no  sooner were the moslems enveloped in the shadows of night than they set off  towards the city, and approached its walls, where god almighty opened to them the  means of success, by sending a providential fall of hail, which prevented the stepping  of the horses from being heard\n",
      " the moslems proceeded gently and unnoticed till  they arrived on the banks of the river,® which they crossed, finding themselves then  at a distance of only thirty cubits, or perhaps less, from the walls\n",
      " owing to the  squalls of rain, and the cold of the night, the sentries, neglecting their duties, were  not on the walls keeping guard, a circumstance which allowed the moslems to arrive  unheard and unmolested at the foot of the battlements; they then attempted to  scale the walls, but failed in their attempt by not finding a place to fix the  ladders\n",
      " in this difficulty they returned to the shepherd, and asked him to lead  them to the breach he had mentioned ; this the man did, but it was also found upon  trial not to be of easy ascent\n",
      " however, this was after some time obtained by  means of a fig tree, growing close to the walls, the branches of which afforded the  means of ascending\n",
      " one of their strongest men mounted the tree, whence he  succeeded in gaining the top of the breach\n",

      "  mugheyth, who remained on horseback at the foot of the battlements, then com-  manded the assailant party to rush upon the guard within the city\n",
      " this order was  quickly obeyed by the moslems, who surprised and killed many of the garrison,  and, breaking open the gate, let in mugheyth and the rest of his men, who soon got  possession of the city\n",

      " as water was  conveyed under ground to this church from a spring at the foot of a neighbouring  mountain, the besieged defended themselves some time against mugheyth, who  nevertheless ruled in the city and its environs\n",

      " they all  agree, it is true, in the taking of the church after a considerable resistance, and the  flight and capture of the governor, but some relate this event as having happened  before, not after, the reduction of the fortified church, and say that after taking  the governor prisoner mugheyth invested the building where the christians had  taken refuge, and, having reduced it, put every one of them to the sword: the  same historians asserting that the church was called ever since kentsatu-l-asrat  (the church of the captives)\n",
      " be this as it may, certain it is that mugheyth made  the governor of cordova prisoner, and’ spared his life with the intention of pre-  senting him to the khalif al-walid on his return to the east, this christian being  the only captive of the royal blood of the goths taken at the time of the conquest,  the rest having either surrendered on terms which secured them their liberty or  escaped to galicia\n",
      " however, as we shall presently see, mugheyth was not able  to accomplish his purpose, for some time afterwards a dispute having arisen between  him and misa as to whose province it was to present the royal captive to the  khalif, the latter, seeing that he could not prevail upon mugheyth to relinquish  his prize, slew the gothic slave in the very presence of his master\n",

      " he then fixed his abode in the  palace, and left the rest of the town to be inhabited by the moslems\n",
      "n the meanwhile the forces that proceeded against malaga '* took possession of  that town, the barbarians flying for refuge to the neighbouring mountains\n",

      " the citadel of this latter place they intrusted to the  care of the jews, and this practice became almost general in the succeeding years ;  for whenever the moslems conquered a town, it was left in custody of the jews,  with only a few moslems, the rest of the army proceeding to new conquests\n",

      " in this stratagem he besieged in  succeeded, for the moslems, overrating his forces by the numbers they saw on  the walls, offered him peace, and theodomir, feigning to accept of it, repaired  in disguise to the camp of the moslems; and there, as if he were a deputy from  his own people, he first treated for the security of the inhabitants, and afterwards  for his own\n",
      " when he had brought the moslems to grant him the terms which  he wished for, he made himself known to them, giving as an excuse for his  stratagem the great love he had for his subjects, and his ardent wish of obtaining  for them a favourable capitulation\n",
      " he then guided them into the town, according capitulates\n",
      "  to the treaty agreed upon, but when the moslems saw that there were in it only  women and children, they were very much ashamed of themselves, and mortified  at having been deceived\n",
      " they, however, observed faithfully the terms of the  treaty, as it was their custom to do on every occasion; so that the district of  tudmir, by the artifice of its king, was freed from the invasions of the moslems,  and the whole of its towns and villages were comprised in the same capitulation\n",

      " it had been the capital of the country in ancient times,  and remained such until the conquest of andalus by the goths, at which time  these transferred the seat of government to toledo, as we have observed elsewhere ;  still the heads of the church resided there,** and seville was considered one of  the principal cities in andalus\n",

      " musa laid siege to it, but the people,  being brave and determined, repulsed the moslems several times with great loss\n",
      "  miisa then had a war-engine* constructed, by means of which the moslems  approached one of the towers under cover, and began undermining the wall; but  this also proved ineffectual, for no sooner had they begun to displace and remove  the stones than they found themselves in an open space, a kind of work which the  barbarians call in their language al-eshah meshah:** having there laid down‘’ thei\n",

      " not having agreed  then, the deputies returned back to the city, and appeared again before him on  the day before the feast of al-fitr;** but what was their astonishment to behold  his beard, which he had tinged with hinna,“ dyed of deep red, resembling  that of the branches of the ’arfaj\n",
      "° again not having come to a perfect under-  standing, the deputies returned to the city, and when they came to visit misa  the next day, they were still more astonished to see his hair and beard entirely «  black, a circumstance which filled them with amazement, for the barbarians were \\  totally unacquainted with the practice of staining and dressing the beard\n",

      "n the meantime, and while misa was occupied in the conquest of merida, the rebellion a  inhabitants of seville, assisted by those of beja and liblah (niebla), revolted against  the moslems, and killed about eighty men belonging to the garrison ; in consequence  of which, after the surrender of merida, musa dispatched his son ’abdu-l-’aziz with  an army against the insurgents\n",
      " he first marched to seville, which he took,  making great slaughter among its inhabitants ; he then proceeded to niebla, which  he reduced also, and, after re-establishing his authority and upholding islam in  those districts, came back to seville, where he fixed himself, making it the capital  of the mohammedan conquests\n",
      "\n",
      "about the end of the month of shaww4l® of the same year (ninety-four), misa  left merida to go to toledo, and when térik was informed of his arrival he went  out to receive him with his principal officers, and met him in the district of talavera\n",
      "  this is according to some historians, for others say that from merida he proceeded to  galicia, which he entered by the mountain pass called fej-tdrik (the pass of tarik) ,*  and traversed the whole of that country until he overtook térik, the leader of the  van of his army, at astorga\n",
      " but the former account is the most probable, besides  being adopted by the best writers\n",
      " all agree, however, that misa’s reception of  his freedman was both unnatural and unjust,—that he reprimanded him severely for  advancing contrary to his orders into the heart of the country, and manifested in  public all the envy and animosity he had conceived against him\n",
      " they say, also,  that the moment térik perceived his master he alighted from his horse, out of  respect, and to do him honour, but that misa struck him with his whip,”  reproached him with his disobedience, and upbraided him before all the army  for acting against his orders\n",
      " he then took térik with him to toledo, where  he summoned him to produce all the spoil gained from the enemy at the taking  of that town, and especially the famous table of suleyman, son of david, for which  he seemed to wish more eagerly than for any other article found at the time of the  conquest\n",
      "e have already said something on this inestimable jewel, descriptions of which  are to be met with in almost every book on the history or geography of andalus\n",
      "  these, however, are not all alike, since by some the materials of the table are said  to be pure gold, by others green emerald\n",
      " some describe it as being made of gold  and silver, and having round it a row of pearls, another of rubies, and a third of  emeralds, and being, besides, strewed with innumerable precious gems ; others make  its substance to be solid emerald, and pretend that it had three hundred and sixty-  five feet ; others again say that it was all set with a variety of precious stones, and  incrusted with all sorts of aromatic woods, and that the whole was covered with  inscriptions in greek\n",
      " but as that trustworthy and accurate historian, ibnu  hayy4n, has preserved a description of this table, as well as an account of its  origin, we’ shall refer to him\n",
      "is words are as follow :—‘ the celebrated table which tarik found: at toledo,  “although attributed to suleyman, and named after him, never belonged to that  “ prophet, according to the barbarian authors, who give it the following origin\n",
      "  ‘« they say that in the time of their ancient kings it was customary amongst them  “ for every man of estimation and wealth’ to bequeath, before dying, some of  “‘his property to the churches\n",
      " from the money so collected the priests caused  “tables to be made of pure gold and silver, besides thrones and huge stands,*\n",
      "“for the priests, deacons, and attendants to carry the gospels when taken out at  ‘‘ public processions, or to ornament the altars ® on great festivals\n",
      " by means of  “such bequests this table was wrought at toledo, and was afterwards emulously in-  “ creased and embellished by each succeeding monarch, the last trying always to sur-  “ pass his predecessors in magnificence, until it became the most splendid and costly  “ jewel that ever was made for such a purpose, and acquired great celebrity\n",
      " the  “ fabric was of pure gold, set with the most precious pearls, rubies, and emeralds ;  “around it was a row of each of those valuable stones, and the whole table was  “ besides covered with jewels so large and bright that never did human eye behold  “any thing comparable to it\n",
      " toledo being the capital of the kingdom, there was  “no jewel, however costly, no article, however precious, which could not be pro-  “cured in it; this and other causes concurred to ornament and embellish that  “ inestimable object\n",
      " when the moslems entered toledo it was found on the great  “altar of their principal church, and the fact of such a treasure having been  “ discovered soon became public and notorious\n",
      "\n",
      "arik soon perceived by the haste that his master misa made to come from  africa, and his eagerness to demand from him the spoils acquired, that he was  devoured by envy ; he, accordingly, decided upon taking away one of the legs of the  table, which he kept concealed, and which afterwards became, as we shall see, his  principal argument against musa, when in the presence of the khalif the latter  disputed with him the possession of this jewel, which he pretended to have found  himself\n",
      "rrived in toledo, miisa asked tarik to produce the table of suleyman, and the  order being instantly obeyed, it was brought to the presence of the arabian general,  who, seeing it with only three feet instead of four,®' immediately questioned tarik  respecting it\n",
      " tarik answered, that he had found it thus; upon which miisa caused  a foot of pure gold, handsomer than which none could be procured, to be wrought ;  and notwithstanding its great disparity, (the other three being made of emerald,) to  be fixed to the table, which he laid carefully up until he should present it himself to  the khalif al-walid as the fruit of the andalusian conquest\n",
      "fter this misa is represented as having cast tarik into prison, and as meditating  his death, which he would have accomplished had not a messenger of the khalif  arrived in andalus with orders to set him at liberty, and restore him to the com-  mand of the troops\n",
      " however, it appears by ibnu hayydn’s narrative that he soon  restored to him his confidence and friendship ; when, uniting their forces, they both  proceeded to new conquests, and speedily subdued the remainder of andalus\n",
      "misa’s reconciliation with tarik—they invade france—arrival of mugheyth with a message from the  khalif—galicia and asturias invaded—a second message from al-wélid—musa departs for the east—  leaves africa for syria—arrives in damascus—falls into disgrace—is imprisoned and fined—his  death—opinions concerning his family and origin—his character\n",
      "ae arter this misa seemed reconciled to térik, treated him with affability and  tarik\n",
      " kindness, and confirmed him in the command of the van of the army\n",
      " he then  gave him orders to march before him with his division, misa himself following him  with the main body of the troops\n",
      " taking the route of ath-thagheru-l-a’lt (aragon),  they subdued saragossa and its districts, and continued to penetrate far into the  country,’ tarik preceding him, and not passing a place without reducing it, and  getting possession of its wealth, for god almighty had struck with terror the hearts  of the infidels, and no one came before him but to ask for peace\n",
      " misa followed  the track of tarik, achieving the conquests begun by him, and confirming to the  inhabitants the conditions agreed upon by his lieutenant\n",
      " when the whole of that  country had been subdued, such of the moslems as consulted their safety were of  opinion that they should return, while others, and they were the greater number,  they invade eagerly desired to penetrate into the land of the franks\n",
      " accordingly musa, after  devoting some time to make the necessary selection of those who volunteered to go  with him from those who preferred remaining, proceeded with the rest to the country  of the franks, a land where the moslems after them never ceased making conquests,  gaining spoil, storming cities or granting them peace on the usual terms, till they  reached the river rodhanoh (rhone), which was the furthest limit of their con-  quests and incursions in the country of the barbarians\n",
      " indeed, the bands which  tarik had led to andalus subdued also the country of afranj, and made them-  selves the masters of the two cities of barcelona and narbonne, of the rock of  abenitin? (avignon), and of the fortress of lidhiin (lyons), on the banks of  the rhone, the moslems advancing far into the country and separating them-  selves considerably from the shore by which they had penetrated\n",
      " the distance  between narbonne, in the country of afranj, and cordova is, according to some\n",
      "three hundred and thirty-five farsangs, according to others, three hundred and  fifty\n",
      "ow far misa pushed his conquests into the land of the franks is not explicitly  related by the historians of andalus\n",
      " some say that after the taking of saragossa  he went eastwards into the country of the franks,‘ subduing on his passage  gerona, calahorra, tarragona, barcelona, and other principal cities of those  districts\n",
      " others say that he penetrated as far as narbonne and carcassonne,  both of which he subdued\n",
      " they relate that on his way to one of those cities  he crossed a great desert, where he saw the ruins® of ancient buildings scat-  tered on the ground, and among them a colossal monument, like a-column, rising  high into the air, bearing the following inscriptions engraven in arabic cha-  racters on the stone\n",
      " ‘‘o sons of isma’il, hither you will arrive, hence you must  “return ;” and on the other side, ‘‘ for if you go beyond this stone you will return  “ to your country to make war upon one another, and consume your forces by dis-  “ sensions and civil war\n",
      "””® miisa was terrified at the mysterious meaning of these  expressions ; he called his men together, and consulted them as to whether they  should go back or advance beyond the column; the opinions were divided, but  the greater part wishing to return, miisa followed their advice, and retreated with  his army into andalus, after having seen enough of the country to judge of the  boundless plains that lay before him\n",
      "bnu khaldiin’s words are as follows: ‘‘ having met his master, musa ibn  “ nosseyr, térik resigned the command of his troops into his hands, and placed  “himself under his immediate orders\n",
      " miuisa then completed the conquest of  “ andalus, and, led by him, the moslem armies reached as far as barcelona in the  “ east, narbonne in the north, and the idol of cadiz in the west, subduing all the  “intermediate provinces and gaining incredible spoil\n",
      " it is confidently believed  “ that, elated with success, misa conceived the project of returning to the east by  “‘ way of constantinople ; for which purpose he intended to march from andalus  “at the head of his brave troops, until, by making his way through the countless  “ christian nations that inhabit the great continent, he should arrive at the court of  “the eastern khalifs\n",
      " however, this design having reached the ears of al-walid,  “who well knew the state of mohammedan affairs in andalus, and feared that if  “ misa once communicated his intention to his army they would all follow him, he  “ dispatched to him a messenger to signify his displeasure, and to order him to  “desist from his rash enterprise, and to appear alone, without his army, in the  “ khalif’s presence\n",

      " let them alone until their hands are well loaded with spoil, for when they  “ have settled in this country and established their government, they will then vie  “‘ for command, and fight with one another for the acquisition of it\n",
      " that will be  “ the time and occasion for our attacking them, and i doubt not but that we shall  “ easily vanquish them :’ and by allah so it was; for in the civil wars that soon  “ afterwards broke out between the syrians and the beladis,’° the berbers and the  ‘* arabs, the tribes sprung from modhar, and those of yemen, the moslems divided  ‘* into factions, made war upon each other, and lent each other assistance against  “ the people of their own nation, their brethren in country and religion\n",
      "\n",
      "t is also reported that musa ibn nosseyr sent his son ’abdu-l-a’la' against  tudmir, and also against granada, malaga, and the district of raya, which cities  he entirely subdued\n",
      " on this occasion they tell the following adventure of ’abdu-  1-a’la at the siege of malaga\n",
      " they say that the governor of that city was a stupid —  man, and one who did not much care for the safety of the town\n",

      " no sooner, therefore, was the arabian amir informed of this circumstance  by his spies than he prepared an ambush for him, and concealing a small body  of his best and most experienced horsemen near the walls of the garden where the  governor was, these rushed at night upon the house, surprised him, and made  him their prisoner\n",

      "other charges brought against him were equally correct; he therefore deprived  him of all the riches he had acquired, and banished him to a distant province of  his empire: others say that he imprisoned him, and ordered that he should be  kept with the greatest vigilance ;—that he also fined him very heavily, whereby he  became so poor that he was obliged to beg for his subsistence among the arabs,  the tribe of lakhm, to which he belonged, having contributed ninety thousand  pieces of gold towards the payment of his fine, which is said to have amounted to  two hundred thousand\n",
      " half of this enormous sum musa paid down, but he failed  in procuring the means of paying the rest, when, having excited the compassion  of ibnu-l-muhlib,* a favourite of suleymén, that courtier interceded for him with  the khalif, who absolved miisa from the payment of the remainder and par-  doned him, although he gave orders for the removal of ’abdullah, his eldest son,  from the government of africa\n",
      "anied the historians who follow the former of the two opinions, namely, that misa  reached damascus before the death of al-walid, relate that when misa arrived  in syria the khalif was indisposed, and that when suleymdn, who was the pre-  sumptive heir, heard of miisa’s approach, he wrote requesting him to delay his  entry into damascus until his brother was dead and himself succeeded to his  throne, that the rich spoils he brought with him might grace his inauguration,  and give him popularity among his subjects, who had never seen or heard of  such an accumulation of riches\n",
      " this misa refused to do, from motives of  fidelity to his lawful sovereign, and, hastening his march, arrived in damascus  while al-wélid was still alive, and delivered into his hands the fifth of all the  spoil, the fruit of his conquests, besides immense treasure and countless wealth,  and many valuable gifts, all the produce of the plunder collected in andalus\n",

      "f the two preceding accounts the latter is, in our opinion, entitled to most  credit, since there can be no doubt that misa was imprisoned and fined in the  year ninety-six (beginning september, 714), at the beginning of which al-walid  died; and therefore what ibnu hayy4n says, that it was suleyman ibn ’ab-  di-l-malek who disgraced and imprisoned misa, is the true account, and no\n",
