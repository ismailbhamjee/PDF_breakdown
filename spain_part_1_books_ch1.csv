"    THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.    Tue conquests and settlements of the Arabs in the south of Europe may be ranked among  the events best calculated to engage our curiosity and attention. The followers of Mo-  hammed, whether considered as the enthusiastic warriors whose victorious arms spread terror  and consternation over our continent, or as the cultivated race who led the way for us  in the career of letters and civilisation, are certainly entitled to a prominent place in the  annals of modern Europe. That part of their history especially which relates to the occupa-  tion of the Spanish Peninsula merits a careful investigation. It was from Spain that issued  those dreaded expeditions which threatened more than once the liberties of Europe; in Spain  shone the first rays of that civilisation which subsequently illumined the whole of the  Christian world; in the Arab schools of Cordova and Toledo were gathered, and carefully  preserved for us, the dying embers of Greek learning; and it is to Arab sagacity and  industry that we owe the discovery or dissemination of many of the most useful and  important modern inventions.   However palpable and undeniable these facts may now appear, it was long before men of  letters in Europe could be brought to admit them; and the Arabs, instead of being com-  mended to the gratitude of modern ages, as they assuredly deserved to be, have been often  charged with corrupting the infancy of modern literature. In no country of Europe, perhaps,  were the pernicious effects of this unjust accusation so sensibly felt as in Spain, once the  seat of their glory, and the country which participated most largely in the benefits of their  civilisation, Mariana, and the best Spanish historians, actuated either by violent national  hatred, or by a spirit of religious bigotry, have always manifested the greatest contempt  for the writings of the Arabs, whom they frequently stigmatize as “a ruthless warlike  “nation, hostile to science and polite literature.” Rejecting the means of research af-  forded them by the abundant historical records of the Arabs, as well as the advantages —",11,,
"    viii THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.    likely to result from a comparison between the Christian and Mohammedan accounts of  the same events, they compiled their histories chiefly from one-sided national authorities;  and, without attending to the successive revolutions of the Arab states, their internal wars,  divisions, and numerous dynasties,— without stopping to consider their social condition,  or to inquire into the causes of the rise and fall of their power,—topics all so closely  allied with the subject they had in hand,—those historians proceeded on their course wholly  unmoved by the vicissitudes of the Mohammedan kingdoms, and as if not deigning even to  cast a glance on the enemies of their country and religion. The effects of such illiberality  on their writings need scarcely be pointed out. The history of Spain during the middle  ages has been,—and still is, notwithstanding the labours of modern critics,—a tissue  of fable and contradiction. What else could be expected from authors who confidently  believed and blindly copied in their writings the wretched production of the Morisco Miguel  de Luna, whose work,' it might be plausibly argued, was intended rather as a hoax upon the  grave inquisitors at whose command it was written, than as a history of the Spanish  Moslems; inasmuch as his ignorance of the language of his ancestors,—sufficiently evinced  in the etymologies interspersed throughout his work,—cannot adequately account for his  not knowing that Ya’kib Al-mansir, in whose time he places the invasion of Spain, lived  ~_ five centuries after that gent !   It would, however, be unfair to attribute the neglect above complained of solely to the  bigotry—real or affected—of authors otherwise commendable for their criticism or their  learning. The real cause of it must be sought for in the superstition and intolerance of the  Spanish Government. No attempt was made at any time to repair the awful injury inflicted  on literature in general, and, above all, on the history and antiquities of the Spanish Peninsula,  by the barbarous decree of Cardinal Ximenez, who caused eighty thousand Arabic volumes?         1 Historia verdadera del Rey Don Rodrigo, con la perdida de Espafia y la conquista que della hizo  Mirammolin Almancor, Rey que fue del Africa, y de las Arabias, y vida del Rey Tacob Almancor.

No better illustration can be given of the utter contempt in  which the study of Arabic literature was held in Spain during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,  than the fact that this wretched production should have gone through so many editions, whilst the  “Historia Arabum” of Rodericus Toletanus, an invaluable treasure of Spanish history, was never   ~ Printed but out of that country.   ? According to Robles, who wrote a life of Cardinal Ximenez, the number of volumes consumed in this  literary auto de f¢, was one million and five thousand,—no doubt a monstrous exaggeration of that writer,  who thought thereby to increase the merits of his hero!

The Arabic language was anathematized as “the rude language of an heretical  “and proscribed race,’ unworthy of being learned by a Christian, unless for theological  purposes; and the few works that escaped the general destruction remained in the hands  of ignorant priests, the only persons deemed capable of perusing them without danger of  contamination.   However, towards the latter half of the last century, the Spanish Government, stimulated  by the example of other nations, and actuated by a more liberal policy, began at last to  encourage the study of Arabic literature. The fire which broke out in the Escurial, and  which is said to have consumed more than three-fourths of the magnificent collection of  Eastern manuscripts therein contained, roused the Spanish Government from its lethargy, and  the task of making a catalogue of the remaining manuscripts was intrusted to the learned  Casiri. His “ Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana Escurialensis,” which appeared in the years  1760-70, bears traces of great assiduity and labour, and, considering the time in which it  was written, displays considerable learning. It is, however, hasty and superficial, and  contains frequent unaccountable blunders. The historical extracts given in the second  volume are for the most part incorrectly printed, and the version is far from being either  accurate or faithful. Yet, with all its imperfections, Casiri’s work must ever be valuable  as affording palpable proof of the literary cultivation of the Spanish Arabs, and as containing  the first glimpses of historical truth, afterwards so successfully developed in the work of the    Jesuit Masdeu.* Nearly contemporary with Casiri lived Don Faustino de Borbon,‘ an author              3 Historia critica de Espana, Madrid, 1783-1800.

He was born at Madrid in 1755  or thereabouts, and was reputed to be the natural son of the Infante Don Gabriel, brother of Charles III.,  then the reigning monarch. He nevertheless passed as the son of a Maltese gentleman who filled the  office of Eastern interpreter to the Government. His printed works bear the name of ‘ Faustino de  Borbon,’ or the initials ‘ F. de B. ;’ but in other productions of his pen, which are preserved in manuscript  in the library of the British Museum, he styles himself ‘Don Faustino Juan Nepomuceno de Borbon,  Vandoma, Guzman, vulgo Muscat.’ He wrote the following works: 1.

"    x THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.    who seems to have passed most of his life in the Escurial Library, with a view to the  illustration of the history of his native country during its occupation by the Moslems,  but whose works are little known, and, from circumstances not easily explained, have  become exceedingly scarce. His Cartas para ilustrar la historia de Espaia,—the only  production of his pen which I have been able to obtain,—were printed at Madrid in 1796,  in monthly parts. They relate to a period of Spanish history which is, of all others, the  most important, namely, from the insurrection in the mountains of the Asturias to the  death of Pelayo in 727. The author has shown vast erudition and learning in the historical  antiquities of his country, and occasionally displayed great sagacity in the unravelling of the  historical difficulties in which he found himself entangled at every step; but he was evidently  no critic, and, whilst defending with great ardour untenable historical points, he often  indulged unnecessarily in the wildest speculations, as I shall have occasion to show in the  _Rotes to this volume.  “Then came Don José Antonio Conde, to whom literary Europe is indebted for the  only complete history of the Spanish Moslems drawn entirely from Arabian sources,—an  author whose name cannot be mentioned otherwise than respectfully by those who, like  me, follow in his steps. But, popular as his work may have been,—and may still be,  with a certain class of readers,—there can be no doubt that it is far from fulfilling the  expectations of the scholar; and competent judges have lately put it on a level with that  of Cardonne, a French writer by no means Conde’s equal in learning or literary accom-  plishments. Disparaging as this judgment may appear on a work which has been the  “foundation of all our knowledge on the history of Mohammedan Spain, it is, nevertheless,  in some manner justified by the uncouth arrangement of the materials, the entire want of  critical or explanatory notes, the unaccountable neglect to cite authorities, the numerous re-  petitions, blunders, and contradictions. But the defects of Conde’s work will be more clearly  perceived, as well as more readily excused, if we first form an idea of the materials used in its  composition. By some strange fatality, the library of the Escurial, though rich in works  valuable for their antiquity or their contents, is yet particularly deficient in the very depart-         de las Provincias de Leon, Vierzo, Valladolid, Zamora y Toro.—1x.

"    THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. xi    ment which ought to have constituted its chief treasure, namely, the history and geography  of the Peninsula during its occupation by the Moslems. The reason for this deficiency is  obvious enough : the collection of Eastern manuscripts now in the Escurial is not the result,  as elsewhere, of the constant solicitude of an enlightened Government, but the mere work of  accident; and had not two Spanish galleys, while cruising in the Mediterranean, captured  three Moorish vessels having on board an extensive collection of books belonging to Muley  Zidén, Emperor of Morocco, it may be presumed that the Libraries of Spain would not now  contain a single Arabic manuscript; for, whilst those of Paris, Vienna, and Leyden, which  scarcely counted a few volumes at the beginning of the last century, have increased their  stocks to a number double and treble that of the Escurial, the Government of Spain has made  no effort to augment that rich but dilapidated collection. The few works of any historical  value which exist in that Library are Biographical Dictionaries,—a favourite branch of  literature with the Arabs,—where the genealogy, the year of the birth and death, the  masters and pupils, of the individual panegyrized, together with a list of his writings, and  some extracts from his verses, are given at full length, while those important historical events  with which he may have been connected are dispatched in a few words. If the individual,  moreover, happen not to be a poet, or a patron of literature, whatever his military talents  may have been, or however important the transactions in which he was engaged, he is taken  no notice of.   From: such: rough materials Conde’s work is chiefly composed, and with the exception  of the second volume,—which is an unfaithful and rambling version of the Karttds,s—  the remainder is but a confused mass of biographical articles borrowed from various writers,  and joined together without the least regard to the age or style of the composition. The  incoherence of the narrative, and the numerous blunders resulting from such an assemblage of  heterogeneous materials, need scarcely be pointed out. Events are frequently related twice  in quite different moods, and the same individual is made to appear repeatedly on the stage  under various names.° If to this it be added that Conde, a victim to mental anxiety and    > A Portuguese translation of this work by José Moura has since been published at Lisbon, 1828, 4to.   © The mistakes in Conde’s work, though unnoticed by the generality of its translators or compilers,  must be palpable enough to all those who peruse it with the least attention. The last three chapters of  the second volume are repeated, with very slight verbal alteration, in the third. He writes the name  of Ibrahim Ibn Humushk, a celebrated warrior, in six different ways.

Hariz  Ton Okkéshah, the general of Al-m4miin, King of Toledo, is also variously called—Hariz Ben Alhakem  (p. 29); Hariz Ben Alhakim Ben Alcasha (p. 38) ; Hariz Ben Hakem ben Okeisa (p. 56); and mentioned",15,,

No sooner had I become sufficiently master of the language of the Arabs to be able to  peruse their historical writings, than I was impressed with the idea that, until these were  printed in the original with a literal translation, and their narrative compared with those of  the Christian chroniclers, no great progress could be made towards the elucidation of Spanish  history. I imparted my idea to the venerable President of the Royal Academy of History at  Madrid, who not only agreed with me as to the necessity of such an undertaking, but pointed  out the manner in which it could be best accomplished, communicating to me, at the same  time, the plan of a similar project which had once seriously occupied the attention of that  learned body. An application made by me to the proper quarter met, however, with no  success, and I was obliged to postpone, if not to relinquish entirely, my undertaking. It was  then that I first thought of translating the history of Mohammedan Spain by Ahmed Al-         in a manner as if these names applied to three distinct persons. Limiting, however, my observations  to the first volume,—for which alone Conde can be made answerable, since he himself saw it through the  press,—I can point out many glaring errors. Abi ’A’mir Ahmed Ibn Shoheyd, the celebrated Wizir  of Abdu-r-rahmin III., is called at times Ahmed Ibn Sahid (p. 432), at other times Ahmed Ben Said  (p. 446). The same might be said of Bahliil, who at p. 223 is represented as in arms against Hisham I.,  and a few pages afterwards is called Wizir to Al-hakem I.    7 Conde having, like others of his literary friends, espoused the cause of the French during their partial  occupation of the Peninsula, was appointed by Joseph Buonaparte chief librarian of the Royal Library of  Madrid, which charge he filled as long as the French were in possession of the capital. On the evacua-  tion of the Peninsula by the French troops, Conde retired to Paris, where he passed some years in  arranging the materials he had collected for his history of the Arabs. When his task was completed,  he returned to Madrid in 1819, intending to give it the last touch and commit his work to the press;  but, instead of meeting with the protection and assistance to which his arduous undertaking entitled  him, he was, owing to his political offence, persecuted and oppressed; every possible obstacle was  thrown in his way by the members of the Government, and, if I am not misinformed, the use of the  Oriental manuscripts in the Escurial was refused to him. These marks of indifference to his pursuits,  and animosity towards his person, on the part of his countrymen, and the extreme poverty to which he  was reduced by the refusal of Government to grant him any portion of the emoluments of his former  office, seriously affected the health of Conde, who died in 1820, in a state of almost entire destitution,  just as his friends were about to print his work by subscription.",16,,
"    THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. xiii    makkari. I knew that, by command of Charles IV., a copy of that work, made under the  superintendence of the celebrated French orientalists De Sacy and Langlés from a manu-  script in the Royal Library at Paris, had been transmitted to Madrid as early as 1816; and  although Conde, for whose use the transcript was made, had never been able to ascertain to  what recess it had been consigned, I still hoped that, by searching the Libraries, I should be  able to find it. In this expectation, however, I was likewise foiled; and notwithstanding my  personal exertions and the most diligent inquiries, I have not yet been able to discover what  has become of it. Good fortune procured me at that time the acquaintance of Dr. Frederic  William Lembke, a Hanoverian gentleman, the author of an excellent history of Spain,? who  possessed a copy of Al-makkari, diligently collated by him with those of Gotha and Paris.  Having obtained the loan of the manuscript, I transcribed it entirely, and soon after began a  Spanish translation. This I had nearly completed and illustrated with notes and copious  estracts from other Arabian manuscripts in the public libraries, or in my own collection,  when, in one of my visits to this country, I had the honour of becoming acquainted with  the President of the Oriental Translation Fund, who kindly suggested to me the idea of  offering to the Committee a translation of Al-makkari’s work, copies of which were to be  found in the library of the British Museum. My offer being accepted, I fixed my residence in  London, and recommenced the version in English,—a language in which, owing to my family  connexions and my long stay int this country, I am, fortunately for the accomplishment of  my wishes, tolerably well versed.   In undertaking a translation of Al-makkari’s work, I was well aware that large extracts  from it had been made by Professor Shakespear from a copy in his possession, and printed  in Murphy’s History of the Mohammedan Empire in Spain; that Cardonne and Desguignes  had known and consulted it, and that Dr. Lembke had also borrowed from it. All this, added  to several defects of composition to which I shall presently allude, rendered a translation of  that manuscript less desirable, perhaps, than it would have been under other circumstances,  especially as several historical pieces of undeniable merit still remain untranslated. Yet,  with all these disadvantages, I fixed upon Al-makkari’s text as being the only one, to my  knowledge, presenting a continuous history of the conquests and settlements of the Mo-    hammedans in Spain, and thus offering a vast field for such illustrations and additions from         8 Geschichte von Spanien, Hamb. 1831, forming part of the historical collection entitled Geschichte  der Europiiischen Staaten, by Heeren and Ukert. I have only seen the first volume of this work, which,  from its conciseness, and the use the author has made of the writings of Nuwayri, Al-makkari, and other  Mohammedan historians, promises to be one of the best written histories of the Peninsula.    VOL. I. c",17,,
"    xiv THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.    other historians as I proposed to collect, so as to form a sort of “Critical History of the  Spanish Arabs.”   The work of Al-makkari is divided into two parts; one relates to the history of Spain, the  other contains the life of the celebrated historian and Wizir, Abii ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn  *Abdillah, better known by the surnames of Ibnu-l-khattib (the son of the preacher), and  Lisénu-d-din (the tongue of religion),—a writer whose works are still highly prized and  eagerly read by the learned of Fez and Morocco, and who was himself a pupil of Mohammed  Ibn Mohammed Al-makkari At-telemsdni, one of our author’s ancestors. As Al-makkari  himself informs us (see Preface, p. 10), his first intention was merely to write a biography of  that celebrated individual. This he had completed, and divided into eight books, in which  he treated of the Wizir’s ancestors and birth, of his youth, education, writings, &c., when the  thought struck the author that his work might be rendered more interesting, were he to write  an account of the conquests and settlements of the Moslems in Spain. He then composed the  historical part, which he likewise divided into eight books. Al-makkari seems to have met  at first with considerable difficulties in the execution of his task from the scarcity of historical  records, having, as he informs us, left the whole of his books in Africa, including a very  complete history of Spain under the Moslems, on which he had bestowed considerable labour.  He must, however, have procured books in the East, for he introduces quotations from the best  authors of Mohammedan Spain,— quotations which, as far as I have been able to ascertain by  a comparison with the original works cited, are always correct, and show that he must really   “have possessed copies of their writings. Indeed, the work of Al-makkari is entirely composed  of passages transcribed or abridged from more ancient historians, (the author himself seldom  speaking in his own words,) and chronologically arranged, so that the title of “ Historical  Collections” would perhaps be better suited to it than that of “History.” The plan  followed by the author is this: when relating a particular event, he either transcribes at  length or abridges the words of a historian; immediately after which he relates it  again in two or three different ways from other sources; thus affording several versions  of the same event. If to this it be added, that in transcribing the words of a historian  he frequently makes longer extracts than are necessary, and perhaps quotes three or four  pages merely to tell us the opinion of that historian respecting a matter that might he  related in two lines,—that his narrative is continually interrupted by the introduction of  poems and long extracts from rhetorical works nowise connected with his subject,—that  in his historical information he is at times exceedingly diffuse, while he is often as much  too laconic, relating in few words the most important event, or wasting several pages in    the discussion of another of little or no interest, according as his inclinations as an author",18,,
"    THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. Xv    or the abundance or scarcity of his materials prompted him, and that he but seldom in-  troduces critical or explanatory remarks of his own,—the reader will form a very mean  estimate of Al-makkari’s qualifications as a historian. .   Yet with all these imperfections, and notwithstanding the defects which he has in common  with the generality of the Arabian writers and historians, Al-makkari possesses many ad-  vantages not easily to be met with in other authors. He gives an uninterrupted narrative  of the conquests, wars, and settlements of the Spanish Moslems, from their first invasion  of the Peninsula to their final expulsion—which, as far as I am aware, does not occur  in any other author: and besides, his mode of writing history, though involving repetitions,  is in my opinion the best he could have adopted; for, if the historical facts recorded by  contemporary writers had been garbled and disfigured by a Mohammedan author of the  seventeenth century, the utility of such a production would have been impaired, together  with its authenticity.. As it is, Al-makkari transmits to us a collection of historical extracts  and fragments relative to the history of Spain, taken from works, the titles of which, as well  as the names of their authors, are in most instances given; and thus presents the original text  of ancient historians whose writings are now probably lost.   The deficiency in certain periods of his history, occasioned, no doubt, by his want of  proper materials, is an evil of a more serious nature; but this I have attempted to supply  by inserting, in an Appendix, such fragments from valuable unpublished manuscripts as  were calculated to fill the void, while I have thrown into the Notes and Illustrations such  additional matter as appeared necessary to corroborate or refute his assertions. In short,  by borrowing considerably from other writers who have partially treated the same subject,  I have endeavoured, as far as was in my power, to augment the real value of this work.   I now proceed to state what parts of the work I have selected for translation. From the  second part, viz., that treating of the life and writings of the Wizir Mohammed Ibnu-  |-khattib, I have made only a few short extracts relating to the history of the kingdom  of Granada. Of the first part, however, I have availed myself in the following manner :  Book I., giving a physical and topographical description of Mohammedan Spain, I have  entirely translated, with the exception of various poetical extracts, and some lengthy risd/eh  or epistles, which, besides being strewed with difficulties of no ordinary nature, contain  no historical fact of any importance. Book II., which details the invasion and conquest of  Spain by the Moslems, I have also translated entirely, as well as Book III., containing a  chronological account of the various Mohammedan dynasties which ruled over that country,  and Book VIII., in which the historical narrative is continued till the final expulsion of  the Mohammedans from the Peninsula. Book IV., giving a topographical account of",19,,
"    xvi THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.    Cordova, together with a description of its principal buildings and great mosque, I have  likewise translated. Of Book V., which contains the lives of illustrious Spanish Moslems  Who travelled to the East in search of knowledge, I have made little or no use, except in  the Notes. Not so with Book VI., which contains those of eminent Mohammedans who  left their native towns in the East to settle in Spain; this being perhaps the portion of  the work which affords the most abundant and valuable information, since it treats of the  Arabian Amirs who governed Spain in the name of the Eastern Khalifs,—of ’Abdu-r-  rahmén I., the founder of the dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah,—of other illustrious Moslems  who either commanded armies or filled high offices in the state,—in fact, of almost every  individual of eminence who figured in Spanish history during the first four centuries after  the invasion. Book VII., being almost entirely composed of poetical extracts, intended  “as proofs of the extent of genius and wit of the Andalusian poets, I have thought fit to  suppress, excepting merely a precious fragment on the literature of the Spanish Moslems,  which occupies the fourth and fifth Chapters of Book II. of this translation, and a few  anecdotes therein related in proof or illustration of the superiority of the Andalusians to  every other nation. In order to render the translation a little more readable, I have changed  the order of the Books, and divided the matter into Chapters. I have also suppressed  repetitions, and inverted in a few instances the order of the narrative, which I found fre-  quently arranged without the least regard to chronology.   The copies of Al-makkari’s work which I have used for this translation are the following:   1. A large folio volume, of upwards of 1200 pages, written in the neskhi character,  upon thin glazed paper of Eastern manufacture. The hand-writing is extremely hand-  some and uniform, but so minute as to render the reading almost painful to the eyes,  each page containing fifty-one lines. The title-page is tastefully illuminated, and the in-  troductory part of the preface enriched with gold; each page of the remainder of the  manuscript is enclosed within a thick line of blue and gold. A note at the end of the  volume® states that the transcript was completed in the night of Friday the 29th day of    Safar, a.H. one thousand one hundred and sixty-three (A.D. 1750). The copy is correct,         ° I here translate it:—‘‘ We terminated the composing and writing of the present work on the  “evening of Sunday the 27th of Ramadhdn, a.w. one thousand and thirty-eight (a.p. 1629).

"    xviii THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.    by Abd *Abdi-r-rahmaén Yuisuf Ibn ’Abdi-l-mélik Ibn Ibréhim At-telemséni. Unlike most  abridgments of Arabic works, the present is made with great judgment and care, and  that too by a person fully conversant with the subject. Indeed, such as it is, the work  cannot be adequately styled an abridgment, inasmuch as it occasionally contains some ad-  ditional matter. The author states in the preface, that happening to have in his possession  some of the works quoted by Al-makkari, he bethought him of giving the’ cited passages  entire whenever it was expedient. He has also in many instances most judiciously changed  the order of the events recorded, and suppressed such passages as were repeated. In short,  he has cleansed and recast, as it were, the text of Al-makkari; and as this has been done  with the utmost judgment and criticism, I need scarcely say that in most instances I have  followed this text in preference to that of the original author, regretting that I should  possess only one out of the four volumes of which this valuable rifaccimento seems to hate.  been composed.'®   As I have cited various Arabic works in my notes, I think it proper to apprise the reader  what they are, and where they are to be found; but, before I proceed, I must state a fact  which, however painful to my feelings, I feel myself called upon to disclose. Having  decided on publishing this work in English, and my arrangements for coming to this country  having been completed, I felt that unless I could spend some time at the Escurial, and  ramble amidst the hallowed treasures of its Library, many of the historical points whch it  was my wish to ascertain, and to elucidate in those notes, would remain, for want of proper  research, as obscure as they were before. I accordingly petitioned the Ministers of Her  Catholic Majesty for permission to visit that Library; but, strange to say, notwithstanding  repeated applications on my part, and the interference of persons high both in rank and  influence,—notwithstanding the utility, not to say necessity, of the work I contemplated,—  my request was, as often as made, positively denied, professedly on the plea-that the  Library could not be opened, (a contention having, two years before, arisen between the  Government and the Royal Household as to the possession of it,) but, in reality, from no         10 It would have been highly satisfactory to me to have procured a sight of a complete copy of  Al-makkari’s work, once belonging to Dr. Carlyle, but which is now in the possession of Professor  Shakespear, who was the first, in 1816, to make that work known to the public, through his valuable  extracts inserted in Murphy’s History of the Mohammedan Empire in Spain. His copy, which seems to  be a very good one, would have afforded me additional confirmation in the readings of proper and  geographical names, an object which the translator of an Eastern work ought always to bear in mind;  but I regret to say, that although I applied in time for the loan of it, it has been out of the power of  that gentleman, with whom I am personally acquainted, to gratify my wishes.",22,,
"    THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. xix    other motive than my having publicly avowed the intention of making use of my materials in  this country. This remnant of inquisitorial jealousy about its literary treasures ill suits a  country which has lately seen its archives and monastic libraries reduced to cinders, and  scattered or sold in foreign markets, without the least struggle to rescue or secure  them. i   Owing to the above reason, my quotations from the MSS. in the Escurial Library will be  scanty, being limited to a few short extracts taken on a former occasion. I have, however,  availed myself fully of some transcripts from historical works in that Library, which  the Spanish Government caused to be made at the close of the last century by two —  Maronite Christians, and to be deposited in the Royal (now National) Library at Madrid. In  this number are the Silah, by Abi-l-késim Khalf Ibn Bashkiwal; the Bighyatu-l-multamis,  by Adh-dhobi; the Hillatu-s-seyrd, by Ibnu-l-abbér; the Tekmilah likitdbi-s-silah, by the  same, &c.; a description of which may be read in Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. pp.  31-121, 133-140). Of these and other Arabic manuscripts in the same establishment I  have made a very ample use ; and it is but just to add, in contrast to the illiberality above  complained of, that I am indebted to its enlightened and zealous Librarian, Don Joaquin  Patifio, for the most unreserved perusal of all the valuable works therein contained.   T need not dwell on the statement, that, whilst in this country, I have met with every  possible kindness and encouragement on the part of my friends,'' as well as of the several per-  sons intrusted with the custody of Oriental books in the libraries I have visited: I shall,  accordingly, have frequently to acknowledge in the course of my notes my numerous  obligations for kind assistance, or the loan of scarce and valuable manuscripts.   The works which I have consulted and cited are the following:   Kaldyidu-likiydn ft mahdseni-laydn™ (gold necklaces on the brilliant actions of the  illustrious); a biographical dictionary of poets and learned men who flourished in Spain  during the fifth and part of the sixth century of the Hijra, by Abi Nasr Al-fath Ibn  Mohammed Ibn ’Obeyd-illah Ibn Khakén Al-kaysi. There are two copies of this work  in the library of the British Museum. One marked Add. MSS., No. 9579, is bound  up with a commentary on the Makssirah, a celebrated poem by Ibn Hazem, of Car-  tagena; the other (Bibl. Rich, No. 7525) is also bound up with the Muntekhabu-l-loghati,         ""To Dr. John Lee I am particularly indebted for the loan of several valuable manuscripts, which I  thall duly notice whenever I happen to quote from them. :    Byte lee cst phe) ws",23,,

It contains only the second part out of the four into which the work  is divided; but though incomplete, it is valuable for its antiquity,’* and I have frequently  used it to correct the readings in the former. Besides these two copies of that valuable  work, I have used one in my possession: it is a volume in quarto, of 236 folios, transcribed  about the middle of the sixteenth century of our era by Al-hasen Ibnu-l-huseyn Al-is’héki.   Mattmahu-l-anfus wa masrahu-t-tdénnus ft milhi ahli-l-andalus“ (the spot of recreation  for the eyes and the field for familiarity on the witty sayings of the people of Andalus) ;  another biographical dictionary, by the above-mentioned writer. The copy in the British  Museum (No. 9580) is a volume in octavo, very badly and incorrectly written in the  month of Rabi’ 11., A.H. one thousand one hundred and ninety-two (a.p. 1778-9). The  work is ill described in the Catalogue of Additions for 1833, where it is given as a  copy of the Kaldyidu-l~ikiydn.   Al-muktabis ft tdrtkh rejali-l-andalus'* (the imparter of information, or the fire-striking  steel on the history of the eminent Spanish Moslems); being a history of Mohammedan  Spain by Abi Merwan Hayyaén Ibn Khalf Ibn Hayyén, a historian of the twelfth century  of our era. The third volume, out of the ten which compose the work, is in the Bodl.  Lib. (Nic. Cat. cxxxvu.) It contains the reign of ’Abdullah, son of Mohammed, the seventh  Khalif of the family of Umeyyah in Spain. ‘   Jadh'watu-l-muktabis® (the sparkle of fire from the Muktabis); or an abridgment of  the above work by Mohammed Ibn Abi Nasr Fatih Ibn ’Abdillah Al-azdi Al-homaydi,  a native of the gisland of Mallorca, who died at Baghdéd in a.n. 488. This work is also  in the Bodl. Lib., Hunt. 464. Its contents are the lives of eminent Spanish Moslems,  divided into ten parts, and preceded by a valuable historical introduction. The transcript,  which appears to have been executed towards the middle of the sixteenth century of our    era, is a fair and correct one.         13 A note at the end of the volume states that the transcript was made by Abi-/-walid Ibn Zeydin. I  need scarcely point out the inaccuracy of such a statement, which has also found its way into the  Catalogue of the Rich MSS. How could Abii-l-walid Ibn Zeydin, who died in a.u. 463, make a  transcript of a work which was not composed until nearly seventy years after his death, and in which he  himself figures among the illustrious men of his age? The fact is, that the name of Abii-l-walid Ibn  Zeydin being written in large letters at the head of the biographical notice of him, with which the work  begins, gave rise to that strange mistake. This shows that an Oriental scholar cannot be sufficiently  on his guard against the ignorance or the knavery of an Arabian bookseller.    4    esis Lat ple LS GHB pee y Untill pre    pbs ey gS oF Until © pnsitil Byde",24,,

ALholalu-l-maushiyyah ft akhbdri-l-marrékoshiyyah'* (variegated silken robes from the  history of Morocco); or a history of the Almoravides and Almohades who reigned in  Africa and Spain, compiled from the best authorities. This work, a copy of which is  in my possession, appears to have been written towards the close of the fourteenth century  of our era, but the name of the author is not ascertained. It is true that both my copy  and another of the same work in the Royal Library at Paris (No. pcccxxv.) attribute it to the  celebrated traveller Ibn Battuttah ; but, as I shall show hereafter, this can hardly be the case.   The history of Spain under the Almoravides and Almohades, by Ibn Sdhibi-s-salat,  a historian of the thirteenth century of our era.

Tértkh Ibn Habtb""9 (or the history of Spain, by ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Habib As-solamf). This  is a miscellaneous work, mostly treating of theological subjects, traditions, the beginning  of the world, the prophets, the life of the Prophet Mohammed, predestination, the doctors  who first introduced in Cordova the sect of Malik Ibn Ans, &c. Some of the chapters,  however, relate to the history of Spain, giving an account of the conquest of that country  by the Moslems; the series of the Amirs who governed it in the name of the Khalifs; a  short history of the first seven Sulténs of the house of Umeyyah who reigned in Spain, &c.

"    THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. xxili    Isma‘fl Ibn Ahmed Ibn Sa’id Ibn Mohammed, better known under the surname of  Tbnu-l-athir. This work is but a commentary upon and a supplement to a poem called  *Abdiniyyah, from the name of its author, Abi Mohammed ’Abdu-l-mejid Ibn ’Abdin,  Wizir to ?Omar Ibn Al-afttas, the last King of Badajoz. After the death of his royal  master, who, together with his two sons, was executed by order of Yusuf Ibn Tashfin,  into whose hands he fell a prisoner, a.H. 487, Ibn ’Abdtin composed an elegiac poem ™  to commemorate that catastrophe, as well as the tragical events attending the rise and fall of  the dynasty to which he was attached. In order better to exemplify the instability of human  fortune, the poet takes a short review of all the once powerful empires that fell into  decay. This poem, which, from the tenderness of its strain, and the rhetorical beauties  with which it abounds, is justly considered as one of the brightest gems of Arabian literature,  was, shortly after the death of Ibn ’Abdtn (a. 4. 534), commented upon by the most eminent  authors of that nation. Ibnu-l-athir, among others, continued the poem down to his own  days, adding fifty-two verses to the forty-one of which it was composed, and then com-  mented upon the whole, or rather gave a detailed account of every one of the dynasties,  whether Mohammedan or not, that are mentioned in it. An ancient copy of this valuable  work is in the British Museum (Bibl. Arund., No, 9969). I also possess one which must  have been written soon after the death of the author; for in the note at the end of the  volume I find that the transcript was completed on the 6th of Dhi-l-ka’dah, a.u. 729,  and, according to Haji Khalfah (voc. ’J0‘ratu), Ibnu-l-athir died in 699.

There is a good copy of this work  in the British Museum (Bibl.

Part III. gives the history of the various Mohammedan dynasties that  ruled in the East or the West, including an account of the Berber tribes, and a chrono-  logical notice of the sovereigns of the house of Umeyyah who reigned in Spain. The  work appears to be an abridgment of a larger one which Shehdbu-d-din Ahmed Al-fasi  wrote under the same title. (See Not. et Ext. des MSS. vol. ii.)

My reasons for thinking so are: 1. I find in Héji  Khalfah that Al-beladhori wrote a work on geography entitled as above.—2. The contents of  the volume in question seem to agree with those of the Kitdb fotwhi-l-bolddn by the same  author, as described by Hamacker, Spec. Cod. MSS. Or. Bib. Lugd. Bat. p. 7.—3. I read, at  fo. 15, that the author wrote it during the Khalifate of Al-mu’atadhed, and he often relates  events of the year 279, a date reconcilable with that of Al-belddhori’s death, which, according  to Abu-l-mahdsen, happened in a. H. 289.—4. I have collated some passages with the works  of Ibn Khordédbah, Mes’tidi, and Ibn Haukal, who wrote after Al-belddhori and copied him  in their writings, and find them the same.    ” Ajdyibu-l-maklikdt ""7 (the wonders of creation).

Rich, No. 7438). I also  possess one, the transcript of which was made in the author’s lifetime by Abi-l-hasan  ’Ali Ibn Ahmed Ibnu-l-huseyn, and finished on Tuesday the 18th of Safar, six hundred  and eight (a.p. 1209). At the end of my copy is an appendix, written by the same  author, and transcribed by the same hand, entitled ra AP Bray ‘an epistle on grammar,’  which is not in the copy in the British Museum.

This work, of which my copy is an autograph, written in a.p. 1599, by the pre-  ceptor of Muley Zidin, Emperor of Morocco, before the latter ascended the throne, is one of  those permissions (3 jl!) not unfrequently granted to pupils by their masters, authorizing them  to quote them in writings or conversation. The author divides the moral, religious, and other  sciences into various sections, giving the titles of all the works he read on those topics, and  also the line of doctors through whom the contents of the several works were transmitted to  him. The number of works thus quoted exceeds five hundred; and as the name as well as  ‘the country and age of their respective authors are in most cases stated, it forms a sort of  bibliographical repertory, if not so considerable as that of Haji Khalfah, yet much more full of  correct information respecting the literary history of the Spanish Moslems.

This also is a  kind of bibliographical compilation, giving the names of the authors and the titles of the  books, many hundred in number, which the author read in the course of his literary career.  The work, which is exceedingly valuable in its kind, is in the Escurial Library (Cat.,  No. mpcuxvit.), where I once made considerable extracts from it.   I shall now terminate my prefatory remarks by saying a few words on the system of  orthography which 1 have followed throughout my translation.   It is customary for the translator of an Oriental work to state in the Preface his system  of writing proper names, or rather of expressing in European characters the multifarious  sounds of the Arabic alphabet. Hence have originated almost as many systems as there         ciel asl) dle chill ol BMS yg CAS",32,,
"    THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. Xxix    have been translators, each scholar considering himself entirely at liberty to alter or modify  those of his predecessors. The evil, as regards the experienced reader, is not so great as it  appears at first sight, it being an easy matter for the scholar to distinguish an Arabic proper  name in whatever disguise it may be found, whether written by a German, a Frenchman,  or a Spaniard: not so for the reader who is unacquainted with the languages of the East,  for he will find himself stopped by difficulties to all appearances insurmountable; and  unless a proper system be at once established, uniting under its banners the scholars of  every nation of Europe, it is to be feared that the confusion will shortly wax so great as to  make the ordinary reader lay aside his book in disgust. Had this work been written in  Spanish, as was at first intended, I might perhaps have considered myself fully competent  to decide upon a system that should express the Arabic sounds in the letters of the Spanish  alphabet; since, besides the innumerable words left by the Arabs in that language, it is  a known fact that for upwards of three centuries the Moriscos were in the habit of writing  Spanish with their own letters: but as such was not the case, and I had to fix upon one  of the many systems used in this country, I chose that adopted by the Committee of the  Oriental Translation Fund, although it is, in my opinion, one of the most defective. Ac-  cording to that system the vowels are always sounded as in Italian; the letters b - 3 3    are all represented by dh; WJ JG by &; and » by &. The & and «, are made alike,    as well as the (o and Un this, however, i deemed it necessary occasionally to  deviate from the rule, rendering b by ¢t, and (jo by ss, whenever a word written with  either of those letters could be mistaken for one written with a — or a, .—The letter  fd I have always expressed by a » to show that the vowel before or after which it is placed is to  be pronounced with a sort of guttural aspiration. There is another very material point in which  I have by necessity been compelled to differ from the system alluded to, viz., the pronun-  ciation, in certain cases, of the letters , and | when they are used as ‘letters of prolongation.’  These are invariably rendered, by English writers, by an accented d or v%. But I do not  hesitate to say that such is not the sound which those letters are intended to convey, and  that they ought to be rendered by 6 and é There can be no doubt that the conquerors  of Spain pronounced as the inhabitants of the coast of Africa still do, who say Karménah,  Tarrakénah, Barshelénah, Al-manss6r, Bénah, Lishbénah, (iti By yais\ Bld» By Ip Byes)  not as English scholars are in the habit of pronouncing, Karmiunah, Tarrakinah, Barshelinah,  Al-mansir, &c.

"    XXX THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.    lemsén, and not Kartajénah, Marshdnah, Bejdnnah, Bdjah, &c. 1 need scarcely remark,  that whenever I have had to mention a city or town in Spain preserving its ancient Arabic ,  name, and thus. affording traces of the correct pronunciation, I have taken upon myself  to depart from the rule which I have most scrupulously followed in all other instances.   There is still another case in which I have deviated from the general rule. I have  frequently observed in conversation, and whilst hearing the Western Arabs read poetry, that  the word Jbn is by them pronounced in certain cases with additional emphasis. For instance,  a talbe in the West will say Jén Sa’fd, when alluding to an individual whose father’s name  was ‘ Sa’id” but he will pronounce Jénu Sa’fd with a strong emphasis upon the u of Jénu, if  Sa’id happen to be the family name of the individual. In the former case the word Ibn  means the son, in the latter ‘ the descendant,’ ‘he of the posterity.’ According to this rule I  have written Ibnu Khaldin, Ibnu Sa’id, Ibnu Hayyan, Ibnu Bashkiwél, because the authors  to whom these’ names apply were the members of ancient and illustrious families, known in  Spain as the Beni Khaldin, Beni Sa’id, Beni Hayydn, Beni Baskiwél, &c.; and in order to  render this translation the more intelligible to the generality of readers, I have adopted  the common spelling of words already admitted into the English language, and written  © Khalif,’ ‘ Wizir, ‘ Kédi,’ instead of the more correct orthography, ‘ Khalffah,’ ‘ Wazir,’  § Kadhi,’ &c.",34,,
"    SOME ACCOUNT    oF    THE AUTHOR AND HIS WRITINGS:         Ahmed Al-makkari At-telemséni descended from an ancient and illustrious family esta-  blished at Makkarah, a village not far from Telemsén, since the invasion of Africa by the  Arabs. He was the son of Ahmed, son of Yahya, son of *Abdu-r-rahmén, son of Abi-l’aysh,  son of Mohammed Abi-l-’abbas, son of Mohammed, son of Ahmed, son of Abi Bekr, son of  Yahya, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmén, son of Abi Bekr, son of ’AH, of the tribe of Koraysh. He  was known in the East by the honorific surnames of Al-hdfedh Al-maghrebf (the western  traditionist), and Shehdbu-d-din (bright star of religion). He followed the sect of Mélik Ibn  Ans, and partook of the religious opinions of the Ash’aris, or disciples of Ash’ar. Ahmed was  born at Telemsin, where he passed the first years of his life; learning the Koran and the  traditions under his uncle, Abi *Othmén Said Ibn Ahmed, who then held the office of Mufti  in that city. Under the tuition of this learned man, who was himself the author of many  important works on various topics, Ahmed early imbibed that love of science, and acquired    that taste for literature, by which he was so much distinguished in after-life. Having com-         ' Al-makkari having lived in times comparatively modern, it was long before I could meet with any  Arabic work giving an account of his life and writings. H4ji Khalfah, who mentions him occasionally,  (voc. Tdrikhu-l-andalus, Azhdr, Fat'h, Nafhu-t-t{b, Mukaddamdt Ibn Khaldin, &c.) gives only the year of  his death, and the titles of some of his works. Having perused in vain many biographical dictionaries,  I was on the eve of giving up my task in despair, when my excellent and learned friend, the Rev. J.  Renouard, of Swanscombe, was kind enough to point out to me a very full notice of Al-makkari, occurring  in a Biographical Dictionary of learned men who flourished at Damascus during the eleventh century of  the Hijra, entitled pe cole! wil ysl AP FB) hole ‘the best part of fresh butter on the    illustrious men of the eleventh century,’ by Amin Jelebi. From this work, of which that gentleman  possesses a handsome transcript, executed a.H. one thousand one hundred and seventy-one (a.p.  1757-8), by Isma’fl Ibn ’Abdi-l-kerim Al-jer4’i, the above notice of Al-makkari is abridged.",35,,
"    Xxxli SOME ACCOUNT OF    pleted his education, he quitted his native place in a.u. one thousand and nine_(a.p. 1600-1),  and repaired to Fez, where he sought and frequented the society of the learned men  of the day, with many of whom he contracted an intimate friendship. He then returned to  Telemsan, which place he again left for Fez in 1013. After a stay of fourteen years, wholly  spent in literary pursuits and in the society of the learned, Ahmed quitted Fez towards the  end of Ramadhan, one thousand and twenty-seven (a.p. 1618), and soon after sailed for  Alexandria, intent upon a pilgrimage to Mekka and Medina. He arrived at the former place  early in 1028, and, having made a short stay at Cairo, started for Arabia in the month of  Rejeb of the same year. After duly fulfilling all and every one of the sacred duties incumbent  upon a good Mohammedan on such occasions, he returned in Moharram, 1029, to Cairo,  where he took a wife and settled. In the month of Rabi’ 1. of the ensuing year he visited  Jerusalem and returned to Cairo, whence he generally started every year on a pilgrimage to  Mekka; so that in 1037 he had already visited that place five times, and Medina seven. He  returned to Cairo in Safar, A.H. one thousand and thirty-seven (Sept. a.p. 1627), and left  immediately for Jerusalem, where he arrived in Rejeb of the same year (Feb. a.p. 1628).  After a stay of twenty-five days, he proceeded to Damascus, which city he entered at the  beginning of Sha’bén (March, a.p. 1628). Immediately after his arrival, Ahmed Ibn Shéhin  Ash-shahini, a rich and influential person, and a liberal patron of literature, which he himself  cultivated with success, gave Ahmed suitable rooms in the college of Jakmak, of which he  was the director, and conferred upon him several other distinctions. At the persuasion of this  individual, Ahmed afterwards wrote the historical work of which the present is a translation.  While at Damascus, where he stayed only forty days, Ahmed occupied his time in various  literary pursuits. He used every day after sunrise to sit under the dome of the eagle in  the great mosque, and there deliver eloquent lectures on the Sahih of Bokhari; but the  auditory increasing, and being no longer contained within that narrow space, Ahmed re-  moved to the spacious court of the mosque. These lectures, which generally lasted several  hours, from sunrise to near noon, were attended by the principal citizens, as well as by  all the scholars and theologians of Damascus; the number of people thus assembled  amounting to several thousands. Ahmed left Damascus on the 5th day of Shawwél, a.x.  1037, and returned to Cairo. He again visited that city towards the end of Sha’bén,  A.H. 1040, being received by Ahmed Ibn Shéhin and his other friends as kindly as on a  former occasion. He then returned to Cairo, and, after a short stay, divorced his wife.  He was preparing for another journey to Damascus, where he had determined to settle  for the remainder of his days, when he was attacked by.a violent fever, which caused his    death in the month of Juméda 11., a.H. 1041.",36,,

I find also (fo. 647) that he entertained an idea  of writing a life of the Prophet Mohammed ;'% and that he began, but did not complete, a  Biographical Dictionary of illustrious men born at his own native place, Telemsan, under this    title, “The time of Nisdn'* on the eminent men of Telemsan.”         who mentions this work (voc.

"    THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.    Iy the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful !    Praise be to God, the Lord of Kingdoms; and his benediction be upon his  messenger Mohammed, our refuge from perdition; the favour of God be likewise  on the family of the Prophet and on his Companions, whose radiant lights illumine  the shadows of the deep, as well as on the learned theologians who plunged into  the unfathomable sea of science, and who reached in their writings the superior  regions of eloquence.    Thus saith the humblest and most despicable of God’s servants, the sinner; he  who stands most in need of the abundant mercies of his Lord; the weakest and  most abject of his creatures ; he who is retained by the bonds of his power and  strength, and who is bound by the chains of observance to the Sunnah, and respect  to the prophetic mission, (all this being effected through the favour of the Almighty,  in whom he trusts, and who is his safeguard ;) the contemptible, the perishable,  the sinner, the criminal, he who is entirely destitute of the garments of piety,  Ahmed Ibn Mohammed, known by the patronymic surnames of Al-makkari, Al-  mileki, Al-maghrebi, Al-isha’ri ;1 born, educated, and having passed the first years  of his life at Telemsdn, and resided afterwards in Fez the magnificent, and in Misr  the victorious (Cairo) ;—may God Almighty make him good both in thought and in  action, endow him with pure qualities, and blameless habits ; show him the right path  in whatever he may think, plan, or undertake ; render him fit for the working of good  and meritorious deeds, acts of obedience, and other works, actions, and intentions  agreeable and acceptable to Him; save him from contamination and pollution,  protect him against the deceptions and lies of the Deceiver, defend him from the  venomous shafts of calumny and envy, and change his pravity of thought and  action, his insignificance, and unworthiness, into such a form as may be acceptable  to him.—Amen. :   VOL. I. B",45,,
"    2 THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE.    When the Lord, whose decrees are infallibly executed on his servants, and from  whose will there is no escape, ordered that we should travel away from our country,  and migrate from the place of our birth and infancy, our steps were first directed  towards Al-maghrebu-l-aksd (the extreme west), a country whose excellences and  advantages would be complete, were it not that the demons of discord have been let  loose in its peaceful districts, and the foaming waves of civil wars have inundated  its fields. This we accomplished at the end of the holy month of Ramadhén of the  year one thousand and twenty-seven of the Mohammedan flight (Sept. a. p. 1618),  after having humbly implored the Almighty to facilitate our return to our native  land, and to restore us to the country where good things are most abundant.    O Lord! said we, before starting for our expedition, with the utmost humility and  devotion, listen to our prayer !—permit, through thy infinite bounty, that we may  meet, whether in the East or the West, with whatever is good, and that we may find  through our course in life such means for our maintenance as thou in thy wisdom  hast destined for us,—that we may participate, wherever we reside, in thy ample  favours, and live in entire obedience to thy holy precepts, as communicated by thy  blessed Messenger, whom thou didst send with the prophetic mission to all nations  of mankind, whether red or black, whether Arabs or Barbarians,—(may thy favour  and benediction the most complete visit him, and those of his family, and his  illustrious Companions and their Followers, who followed them in the path of good  and meritorious deeds !) Show us the way through the cultivated plains, and the  sandy deserts, that we may not miss through forgetfulness or sloth any of the places  mentioned in the holy traditions ; and that we may be fully awake to the sense of  their sanctity and merits ; direct our course through plain and mountain, through  field and waste ; and when we embark on the sea, when we find ourself placed  between its enchantments and its horrors, when we witness the continual dashing  of the restless billows, strengthen and comfort our soul, prepare us to meet its  numberless perils, and defend us against its treacherous attacks ; for—    “‘ The sea is a cruel and implacable enemy; and we expect no mercy at his    “ hands. .  “ Knowing the sea to be water, and ourselves to be made of clay; who will    ‘“« wonder if we suffer from its attacks ?”’ ?    After this prayer we set out on our travel, and, having reached the sea shore, we  threw ourself into the hands of the perfidious element. But when we encountered  its terrific waves, when the bone-breaking eagles, disturbed from their nests by the",46,,
"    THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE. 3    hands of the wind, came flying in our faces, when we heard the mountains in the  distance whistle, while the winds groaned and sighed over our heads, we placed all  our confidence in the Almighty God, and trusted to surmount all obstacles by his  help and protection ; for whoever finds himself in danger on the sea, and trusts in  any but in God, is sure of perdition. We were in this state of anxiety when,  behold ! the tempest increases, and the sea joins its terrific voice to the dismal tunes  of the hurricane; the waves, agitated by an irresistible power, go and come,  approach and disappear, and, frantic and infuriated as if they had tasted of the  cup of madness, they knock and dash against each other, then disperse, then rally  again as if they had lost nothing of their vigour, now rising in the air as if the  hands of the sky were taking them by the top and dragging them out of their deep  cavities, or as if they threatened to snatch the reins of the clouds out of the hands  of their conductor ; and now throwing open their frightful and dark abysses, until  the bowels of the earth became visible. In this critical situation every new gust of  the howling hurricane, every fresh attack of the roaring elements, were so many signs  of our certain perdition ; and the perpetual flapping of the shattered sails, the sight  of the waves advancing in close ranks to accomplish our destruction, the awful  crashings of the groaning deck upon which we stood, like so many worms on a  log of wood, all were harbingers of our approaching death ;—our tongue, through  fear, clove to our mouth, our heart sank under the weight of our increasing terror,  and we deemed ourself the victim offered in sacrifice to our implacable enemy ; for  wherever we cast our eyes on the rough surface of the impetuous billows, nothing  was discovered to appease the fury of the element, and to share our fate ; and we  thought ourself the only object in the world, besides the unfathomable deep and  those who might be buried in its dark abysses.    But our situation was rendered still more miserable and precarious through the  watch we were obliged to keep, owing to our proximity to the territories of the  infidels, (may God Almighty exterminate them all, and place their country in the  possession of the Moslems !) especially Malta, that accursed island, from the neigh-  bourhood of which whoever escapes in safety may well say that he has deserved the  favour and protection of the Lord,—that dreaded spot, which throws its deadly  shade on the pleasant waters of the Mediterranean,—that den of iniquity and  treason,—that place of ambush, which is like a net to circumvent the Moslems who  navigate its seas. So what with the danger of the treacherous Christians and the  horrors of the sea, we were kept in a continual state of agitation and terror, expect-  ing every moment to meet with our death ; for we well knew the cruel disposition  of the element with which we were struggling, we knew its unforgiving temper, we",47,,
"    4 THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE.    knew that no courage would be sufficient to tame our adversary and break his  power, no virtue enough to overcome him and humble his pride ; and that no force  could be mustered to prostrate him and make him obedient ; we knew him to be an  enemy who ought on no occasion to be trusted, and who makes no distinction  between friend and foe, between poor and rich, between weak and strong, between  armed and unarmed, between him who sheds tears, and him who affects sorrow.    ‘« There are three things without remedy in this world, and from which nobody is  “* safe; the sea, time, and a Sultén.”?    However, God Almighty was pleased that we should escape both from the perils  of the sea, and from the ambushes of our treacherous and impious enemies, the  Christians ; and that we should discover land, after having lost sight of it for many  days ; that our eyes should be invigorated and refreshed with the view of the port,  after having gazed so long on the horrors of the sea; that our nostrils should be  delighted with the smell of the scented gales of security, after having been affected  by the nauseous and putrid exhalations of the irritated waves ; lastly, that joy and  contentment should succeed to sorrow and affliction, We then reached Alexandria,  and after a short stay proceeded up the river to Cairo, where we began to think  seriously of carrying into execution our project ; so, after passing a few days in that  city, full of that sublime conception and blessed object which makes the happiness  and joy of all the true believers, namely, a visit to the two holy and illustrious  spots of Mecca and Medina, we started for our expedition, and, leaving the sea  behind us, took the route of Hejéz, trusting in God, and relying on his pro-  tection and assistance. .    We arrived at Mecca, and visited its illustrious temple, and .other holy spots, in  the contemplation of which life almost left us, and our soul sank under the excess  of its joy. Having fulfilled all the duties incumbent on a pilgrim, we besought God  to make us of the number of those who pass their lives in his service; and we  remained in Mecca, under the shade of its sanctity, and reaping the fruits of its  blessedness, until the time for a pilgrimage to Medina arrived. This was in the  first days of the month of Dhi-l-ka’dah* of the year one thousand and twenty-eight  of the Hijra (in the month of September, a. p. 1619) ; and when the season for  visiting that and other blessed spots came, we prepared for departure without delay,  and set out on our intended expedition.    And when, after visiting all the sacred spots which lie between Mecca and",48,,
"    THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE. 5    Medina, we set our feet in that latter city, a place which far surpasses in excellency  any other country in the world, we exclaimed, in the words of a poet,—    “Blessed be the purpose which brought us to the mother of cities (Mecca),  “ restrained by the bonds of our faith.   “When we quenched our thirst in the waters of Zemzém, and threw away as  “ useless what remained of our travelling supply.”®    From Medina we returned to Cairo, where we arrived in Moharram of the year  one thousand and twenty-nine. Soon afterwards we started on a visit to Al-Kods  (Jerusalem), and arrived within its blessed walls in the month of Rabi’ of the same  year. When we had penetrated inside its famous temple, and gazed on its wonder-  ful structure, of which no words can give an idea ; when our eyes had been almost  dazzled, and our mind had nearly gone astray in the contemplation of the radiant  beauties with which it is illumined, and through which God appears in more shining  brightness to man, we anxiously inquired for the sacred ladder ; and having directed  our steps to the spot pointed out to us, we saw the place where the best and last  of Prophets had stood.    After visiting all and every one of the sacred spots contained within the precincts of  the holy temple, and making a seasonable stay in Jerusalem, we once more returned  to Cairo, where we fixed our residence, and whence we continued making repeated  journeys to the pure valleys ; inasmuch as, up to the present year (being the one  thousand and thirty-ninth of the Hijra (a. p. 1629-30), we have visited Mecca five  times, and as many times has otr heart leapt with joy at the approach of it,—as many  times have we trod under our feet the roads of the desert leading to it. (May the  Almighty God give us sufficient strength and life to persevere in this good practice !}  Moreover, after the performance of our last pilgrimage, we returned to Cairo in the  month of Safar of the year one thousand and thirty-seven of the Hijra (November,  A.D. 1637), and stayed some time in that splendid capital, until, towards the month  of Rejeb of the same year, we were suddenly seized with a great desire of visiting  again the holy house of Jerusalem ; we therefore took our departure, and arrived  therein at the end of Rejeb, and stayed five-and-twenty days, or thereabouts, God  being pleased during that time to furnish us with whatever was necessary for our  wants, and to give us the company of virtuous and learned people, from whom we  derived both admonition and information. We also visited with the greatest  devotion the tomb of our father Abraham, and such among the prophets as are  buried with him.",49,,
"    6 THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE.    At last, after having accomplished all the duties of a devout pilgrim, having  visited most of the sacred spots, such as that of Moses, he who spoke with God, it  came into our mind, towards the middle of Sha’bén, to travel to a city, whose excel-  lences and beauties are apparent and manifest,—we mean Damascus, that splendid  and magnificent capital, which shines with all sorts of perfections ; which has large  trees rocking before the wind, sweet-smelling gales which perfume its territory,  places of worship and meeting frequented by the believers, houses which are the  abode of the great and the honoured ; a rich and luxuriant meadow, with enclosed  orchards and vineyards, which are continually inviting the inhabitants to partake  of their produce,—a perpetual shadow, to keep off the rays of the burning sun ;  flowers which look as if they were smiling, and whose sweet exhalations embalm the  air ; young trees whose tender shoots spread in the atmosphere a fragrance similar to  that of the everlasting Paradise ; and lastly, (to embrace all these perfections under  one head,) a garden blooming with every variety of natural and artificial beauty,  and glittering with the thousand hues of its innumerable flowers; a city which not  only stands the first among those of its class, but which is abundantly provided with  every thing that is useful or desirable in life, and of which a poet has said,—    ‘‘ The beauties of Damascus increase with time, as the qualities of wine improve  “in the bottle.   “Damascus has an advantage over other Eastern countries; which is, the  ‘« distance of her moons from the West.’’®    We entered Damascus towards the latter end of the said month of Sha’ban, and  had to congratulate ourselves upon our having come to it, and to thank God for  having inspired us with the idea of visiting it; for no sooner did we begin to wander  through its streets, and to gaze on the numerous objects that invited our attention,  than our eyes were dazzled with their magnificence, and we forgot all the wonderful  things that we had seen in other countries. In this way we visited some of its  splendid buildings, and saw some of its great curiosities; and we were so much  pleased, that, although our intention had been to stay only three days, a month  passed without our thinking of our departure ; and during that period of time we  had ample opportunity to witness such proofs of its magnificence and beauty, as  could not be contained within the limits of a volume, and which it would not be in  our power to describe, were we endowed with all the talents of eloquence: for,  indeed, the excellences of Damascus are so numerous, that it would be an act of  madness in us to attempt their description, especially being, as we are, restrained  by the principal object of this work, and pressed by the reader to expose the motives",50,,
"    THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE. 7    of our undertaking. We cannot, however, abandon the subject, without stating  that Damascus is the abode of happiness, comfort, and contentment ; its mosque?  a building uniting in itself more beauties than the most fanciful imagination can  conceive, and its meadow a spot of blessedness and joy, abounding in beauties of  all kinds ;—    “a place of pleasure and delight, an earthly Paradise.”    We had, before our arrival at this city, heard and read so much about it and its  inhabitants—(may God prosper and defend them !)—that we had the greatest desire  of meeting them ; and long before we could put our project into execution we were  anticipating the pleasure and utility which their company and society would afford  us. We were not a little confirmed in our desire through our acquaintance in  Mecca with one of its noblest and most illustrious citizens, one of those virtuous  Shaikhs who are like unique pearls strung in the string of time, the right hand of  the nobles, and the centre of theologians and preachers; he who is renowned for  his writings and his wisdom in judicial matters, whose sentences were always like a  discriminating line between truth and falsehood, between innocence and crime; the  author of works whose number and merits it would be a hopeless task to describe ;  the inheritor of science without its troubles, and the endowed with learning and talents  of the first order,—the Mufti of the Sultén of those districts, in the sect of An-no’-  mén,® our Lord A’bdu-r-rahmdn, son of the Shatkhu-l-islém O’mmédu-d-din, who  never through life left the path followed by the directed. This holy man, with  whose company and society God was pleased to favour us morning and evening,  often told us of the city of Damascus, and of its worthy inhabitants, and strengthened  us im our wish to visit it, and live amongst its people, praising in the highest  terms their hospitality, their amiable disposition, their love of science, their gene-  tosity, and a thousand other brilliant qualities; so that, when we arrived at  Damascus, and began to mix in company with the noble and the learned amongst its  citizens ; when we had witnessed enough of their excellences and virtues to dazzle  our eyes, and make us lose our senses, we discovered not only that the information  bestowed upon us by the learned judge was correct, but that his most vivid and  eloquent descriptions, his most lavish praises, still fell short of their real merits ;  and that, in the words of a poet,— '   “‘ We were surrounded by their qualities shining in every direction :   ‘ And although we had heard much in their praise, the report proved to be true  ‘‘ when the meeting took place.’”’®",51,,
"    8 THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE.    We were received by them with the greatest regard and distinction ; they hastened  to show us all the wonders of their land; the noble and the great honoured us with  their consideration and their friendship ; the learned imparted to us their science,  and furnished us with precious information; every one made us the centre of his  affections and the mark of his generosity. (May God remunerate them as amply as  they deserve!) We experienced, wherever we went, the most cordial and amicable  reception ; we were extolled and praised in spite of our ignorance, honoured and  esteemed in spite of our wickedness ; thanked in spite of our inutility ; and, lastly,  such was their kindness and good behaviour towards us, that we fancied ourselves  one of their family. :    Among the most polite and obliging was our Lord Ahmed Ibn Shéhin Effendi ;'°  he whose praises ornament the pages of the books, and whose panegyrics fall with  more abundance than the autumnal rains ; he who is the revolving axle of the noble  and the honoured, and the prince of writers and poets; he who, taking us by the  hand, led us to the discovery of unfrequented paths of literature, and who poured  upon us the torrents of his generosity.    Encouraged by the favourable reception we had met with, we then came to the  determination of settling for some time at Damascus—(may God preserve the city  and its inhabitants !)—and began to give all our attention to the scrupulous and  careful contemplation of all and every one of the beauties contained in its mosque,  public buildings, palaces, houses, and streets, as well as to a minute perusal of the  natural charms scattered over its fertile meadow: we thus saw and observed many.  things which might as so many incomparable pearls be threaded in the string of  description, while we passed the evenings in eloquent and learned conversations,  under the roof of excellent and generous friends, especially under that of the above-  mentioned illustrious individual (Ahmed Ibn Shéhin), in whose company we spent  the greatest part of the night in pleasant confabulations, exercising and inuring  ourselves to the practice of literature and eloquence, drinking of the limpid waters  of conviviality and friendship, presenting to each other the marrow of our hearts,  spreading the carpet of mirth and good humour, unloosing the strings of formality  and respect, discussing literary points, investigating the sources of tradition, diving  into the unfathomable sea of theology and jurisprudence, wading through the  tortuous maze of history, and travelling over distant lands and unknown regions,  calling to our assistance, whenever we were assailed by doubt, the authority and  testimony of the various masters in the respective sciences. It was then that such  among the company as were eager for science, and covetous of information, began",52,,
"    THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE. 9    to inquire about Andalus, and to entreat us to speak of its fertility and productions,  to praise its excellences and advantages, to record passages of its history, which  eloquence itself could not describe, and to repeat to them the precious sentences,  the inestimable maxims, and the invaluable beauties that lie scattered in the  writings of its historians and poets. It was then that, holding the reins of justice,  and following the road of impartiality, we were imprudent and inconsiderate enough  to undertake such a difficult and laborious task, and began to recite such passages  of its eloquent writers and poets as we knew by heart and God was pleased to put  upon our tongue, especially from the illustrious Wizir Lisénu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattib  As-salmani,"""" (may God pour upon him the torrents of his mercy, and make  him a participant in his ineffable graces!) whom we frequently represented and  described as the knight of prose and verse composition, and the champion who  always won the prize in the literary races of his time. And when we had, on  many occasions, exhausted our powers in praise of the noble Wizir, when we  had represented in the most brilliant colours his merits and virtues, our words  happened to make an impression on the ears of our auditors ; they would hear of  no one but him, and talk of nothing else but his works, until he became the  object of their search, and the end of their wishes and hopes ; the topic of their  conversation, and the idol of their hearts; and, when they had gathered with the  hands of desire the abundant crops from his writings, their minds became impressed  with his superiority in all the sciences, and their nostrils inhaled the scent of the  flowers scattered over his writings. Then our Lord Ahmed Ash-shéhini, the same  illustrious individual in whose praise we have expatiated, the endowed with laudable  intentions, asked us to quench his thirst of knowledge respecting the Wizir Lis4nu-  d-din, in a work that should relate his origin, education, adventures in life, character,  productions, intercourse with kings, poets, doctors, and other learned and eminent  men among his contemporaries,—his glorious deeds, which he strung like so many  unique pearls on the necklace of time, and his literary remains, on some of which  the fatal north wind has exercised his deadly blast: he also requested us to -  reproduce some of the inestimable jewels, whether in prose or verse, which lie  scattered in the Wizir’s voluminous works,—those that dazzle with their vivid  flashes the eyes of the readers, that surpass in merit all the literary productions  of other countries put together, and which have travelled the roads of the sun and  the moon.    But our answer was, that the undertaking was by no means an easy one, God  having granted science only to a few among his most favourite creatures; we  therefore declined the task upon the three following considerations :. first, our   VOL.

This was in the  first days of the month of Dhi-l-ka’dah‘* of the year one thousand and twenty-eight  of the Hijra (in the month of September, a.p. 1619); and when the season for  visiting that and other blessed spots came, we prepared for departure without delay,  and set out on our intended expedition.    And when, after visiting all the sacred spots which lie between Mecca and",56,,
"    THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE. 5    Medina, we set our feet in that latter city, a place which far surpasses in excellency  any other country in the world, we exclaimed, in the words of a poet,—    Blessed be the purpose which brought us to the mother of cities (Mecca),  “ restrained by the bonds of our faith.   “When we quenched our thirst in the waters of Zémzém, and threw away as  “ useless what remained of our travelling supply.’’®    From Medina we returned to Cairo, where we arrived in Moharram of the year  one thousand and twenty-nine. Soon afterwards we started on a visit to Al-Kods  (Jerusalem), and arrived within its blessed walls in the month of Rabi’ of the same  year. When we had penetrated inside its famous temple, and gazed on its wonder-  ful structure, of which no words can give an idea; when our eyes had been almost  dazzled, and our mind had nearly gone astray in the contemplation of the radiant  beauties with which it is illumined, and through which God appears in more shining  brightness to man, we anxiously inquired for the sacred ladder ; and having directed  our steps to the spot pointed out to us, we saw the place where the best and last  of Prophets had stood.    After visiting all and every one of the sacred spots contained within the precincts of  the holy temple, and making a seasonable stay in Jerusalem, we once more returned  to Cairo, where we fixed our residence, and whence we continued making repeated  journeys to the pure valleys ; inasmuch as, up to the present year (being the one  thousand and thirty-ninth of the Hijra (a. p. 1629-30), we have visited Mecca five  times, and as many times has otr heart leapt with joy at the approach of it,—as many  times have we trod under our feet the roads of the desert leading to it. (May the  Almighty God give us sufficient strength and life to persevere in this good practice !}  Moreover, after the performance of our last pilgrimage, we returned to Cairo in the  month of Safar of the year one thousand and thirty-seven of the Hijra (November,  4. D. 1637), and stayed some time in that splendid capital, until, towards the month  of Rejeb of the same year, we were suddenly seized with a great desire of visiting  again the holy house of Jerusalem ; we therefore took our departure, and arrived  therein at the end of Rejeb, and stayed five-and-twenty days, or thereabouts, God  being pleased during that time to furnish us with whatever was necessary for our  wants, and to give us the company of virtuous and learned people, from whom we  derived both admonition and information. We also visited with the greatest  devotion the tomb of our father Abraham, and such among the prophets as are  buried with him.",57,,
"    6 THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE.    At last, after having accomplished all the duties of a devout pilgrim, having  visited most of the sacred spots, such as that of Moses, he who spoke with God, it  came into our mind, towards the middle of Sha’bdn, to travel to a city, whose excel-  lences and beauties are apparent and manifest,—we mean Damascus, that splendid  and magnificent capital, which shines with all sorts of perfections ; which has large  trees rocking before the wind, sweet-smelling gales which perfume its territory,  places of worship and meeting frequented by the believers, houses which are the  abode of the great and the honoured; a rich and luxuriant meadow, with enclosed  orchards and vineyards, which are continually inviting the inhabitants to partake  of their produce,—a perpetual shadow, to keep off the rays of the burning sun ;  flowers which look as if they were smiling, and whose sweet exhalations embalm the  air ; young trees whose tender shoots spread in the atmosphere a fragrance similar to  that of the everlasting Paradise ; and lastly, (to embrace all these perfections under  one head,) a garden blooming with every variety of natural and artificial beauty,  and glittering with the thousand hues of its innumerable flowers ; a city which not  only stands the first among those of its class, but which is abundantly provided with  every thing that is useful or desirable in life, and of which a poet has said,—    “The beauties of Damascus increase with time, as the qualities of wine improve  “in the bottle.   “Damascus has an advantage over other Eastern countries; which is, the  “« distance of her moons from the West.’’®    We entered Damascus towards the latter end of the said month of Sha’bén, and  had to congratulate ourselves upon our having come to it, and to thank God for  having inspired us with the idea of visiting it ; for no sooner did we begin to wander  through its streets, and to gaze on the numerous objects that invited our attention,  than our eyes were dazzled with their magnificence, and we forgot all the wonderful  things that we had seen in other countries. In this way we visited some of its  splendid buildings, and saw some of its great curiosities; and we were so much  pleased, that, although our intention had been to stay only three days, a month  passed without our thinking of our departure ; and during that period of time we  had ample opportunity to witness such proofs of its magnificence and beauty, as  could not be contained within the limits of a volume, and which it would not be in  our power to describe, were we endowed with all the talents of eloquence: for,  indeed, the excellences of Damascus are so numerous, that it would be an act of  madness in us to attempt their description, especially being, as we are, restrained  by the principal object of this work, and pressed by the reader to expose the motives",58,,
"    THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE. 7    of our undertaking. We cannot, however, abandon the subject, without stating  that Damascus is the abode of happiness, comfort, and contentment ; its mosque”  a building uniting in itself more beauties than the most fanciful imagination can  conceive, and its meadow a spot of blessedness and joy, abounding in beauties of  all kinds ;—    “a place of pleasure and delight, an earthly Paradise.”    We had, before our arrival at this city, heard and read so much about it and its  inhabitants—(may God prosper and defend them !)—that we had the greatest desire  of meeting them ; and long before we could put our project into execution we were  anticipating the pleasure and utility which their company and society would afford  us. We were not a little confirmed in our desire through our acquaintance in  Mecca with one of its noblest and most illustrious citizens, one of those virtuous  Shaikhs who are like unique pearls strung in the string of time, the right hand of  the nobles, and the centre of theologians and preachers; he who is renowned for  his writings and his wisdom in judicial matters, whose sentences were always like a  discriminating line between truth and falsehood, between innocence and crime ; the  author of works whose number and merits it would be a hopeless task to describe ;  the inheritor of science without its troubles, and the endowed with learning and talents  of the first order,—the Mufti of the Sultén of those districts, in the sect of An-no’-  mén,® our Lord A’bdu-r-rahmén, son of the Shaikhu-l-islém O’mmédu-d-din, who  never through life left the path followed by the directed. This holy man, with  whose company and society God was pleased to favour us morning and evening,  often told us of the city of Damascus, and of its worthy inhabitants, and strengthened  us i our wish to visit it, and live amongst its people, praising in the highest  terms their hospitality, their amiable disposition, their love of science, their gene-  rosity, and a thousand other brilliant qualities; so that, when we arrived at  Damascus, and began to mix in company with the noble and the learned amongst its  citizens ; when we had witnessed enough of their excellences and virtues to dazzle  our eyes, and make us lose our senses, we discovered not only that the information  bestowed upon us by the learned judge was correct, but that his most vivid and  eloquent descriptions, his most lavish praises, still fell short of their real merits ;  and that, in the words of a poet,—    ‘* We were surrounded by their qualities shining in every direction :  ‘ And although we had heard much in their praise, the report proved to be true  “when the meeting took place.”’?    '",59,,
"    8 THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE.    We were received by them with the greatest regard and distinction ; they hastened  to show us all the wonders of their land; the noble and the great honoured us with  their consideration and their friendship ; the learned imparted to us their science,  and furnished us with precious information ; every one made us the centre of his  affections and the mark of his generosity. (May God remunerate them as amply as  they deserve!) We experienced, wherever we went, the most cordial and amicable  reception ; we were extolled and praised in spite of our ignorance, honoured and  esteemed in spite of our wickedness ; thanked in spite of our inutility ; and, lastly,  such was their kindness and good behaviour towards us, that we fancied ourselves  one of their family. ,    Among the most polite and obliging was our Lord Ahmed Ibn Shéhin Effendi ;'°  he whose praises ornament the pages of the books, and whose panegyrics fall with  more abundance than the autumnal rains ; he who is the revolving axle of the noble  and the honoured, and the prince of writers and poets ; he who, taking us by the  hand, led us to the discovery of unfrequented paths of literature, and who poured  upon us the torrents of his generosity.    Encouraged by the favourable reception we had met with, we then came to the  determination of settling for some time at Damascus—(may God preserve the city  and its inhabitants !)—and began to give all our attention to the scrupulous and  careful contemplation of all and every one of the beauties contained in its mosque,  public buildings, palaces, houses, and streets, as well as to a minute perusal of the    natural charms scattered over its fertile meadow : we thus saw and observed many .    things which might as so many incomparable pearls be threaded in the string of  description, while we passed the evenings in eloquent and learned conversations,  under the roof of excellent and generous friends, especially under that of the above-  mentioned illustrious individual (Ahmed Ibn Shéhin), in whose company we spent  the greatest part of the night in pleasant confabulations, exercising and inuring  ourselves to the practice of literature and eloquence, drinking of the limpid waters  of conviviality and friendship, presenting to each other the marrow of our hearts,  spreading the carpet of mirth and good humour, unloosing the strings of formality  and respect, discussing literary points, investigating the sources of tradition, diving  into the unfathomable sea of theology and jurisprudence, wading through the  tortuous maze of history, and travelling over distant lands and unknown regions,  calling to our assistance, whenever we were assailed by doubt, the authority and  testimony of the various masters in the respective sciences. It was then that such  among the company as were eager for science, and covetous of information, began    Gee oe",60,,
"    THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE. 9    to inquire about Andalus, and to entreat us to speak of its fertility and productions,  to praise its excellences and advantages, to record passages of its history, which  eloquence itself could not describe, and to repeat to them the precious sentences,  the inestimable maxims, and the invaluable beauties that lie scattered in the  writings of its historians and poets. It was then that, holding the reins of justice,  and following the road of impartiality, we were imprudent and inconsiderate enough  to undertake such a difficult and laborious task, and began to recite such passages  of its eloquent writers and poets as we knew by heart and God was pleased to put  upon our tongue, especially from the illustrious Wizir Lisdénu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattib  As-salmani,"""" (may God pour upon him the torrents of his mercy, and make  him a participant in his ineffable graces!) whom we frequently represented and  described as the knight of prose and verse composition, and the champion who —  always won the prize in the literary races of his time. And when we had, on  many occasions, exhausted our powers in praise of the noble Wizir, when we  had represented in the most brilliant colours his merits and virtues, our words  happened to make an impression on the ears of our auditors ; they would hear of  to one but him, and talk of nothing else but his works, until he became the  object of their search, and the end of their wishes and hopes ; the topic of their  conversation, and the idol of their hearts; and, when they had gathered with the  hands of desire the abundant crops from his writings, their minds became impressed  with his superiority in all the sciences, and their nostrils inhaled the scent of the  flowers scattered over his writings. Then our Lord Ahmed Ash-shéhini, the same  illustrious individual in whose praise we have expatiated, the endowed with laudable  intentions, asked us to quench his thirst of knowledge respecting the Wizir Lis4nu-  d-din, in a work that should relate his origin, education, adventures in life, character,  productions, intercourse with kings, poets, doctors, and other learned and eminent  men among his contemporaries,—his glorious deeds, which he strung like so many  unique pearls on the necklace of time, and his literary remains, on some of which  the fatal north wind has exercised his deadly blast: he also requested us to  reproduce some of the inestimable jewels, whether in prose or verse, which lie  scattered in the Wizir’s voluminous works,—those that dazzle with their vivid  flashes the eyes of the readers, that surpass in merit all the literary productions  of other countries put together, and which have travelled the roads of the sun and  the moon.    But our answer was, that the undertaking was by no means an easy one, God  having granted science only to a few among his most favourite creatures; we  therefore declined the task upon the three following considerations :. first, our   VOL. I. c",61,,
"    10 THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE.    insufficiency to conquer the manifold difficulties of a subject which required almost  universal knowledge, and a perfect acquaintance with all the branches of literature ;  secondly, our want of the necessary books to assist us in our task, since we had  left our library in Maghreb, and most of the works we wanted were in the East  more scarce than the griffin ;'? and thirdly, the nature of the enterprise abounding  with cases of a most extraordinary kind, occurring with double force to a mind bent  upon melancholy, as ours is, and the division of our attention between the diffi-  culties of the subject and the unhappy events we had to relate.    However, our reasons having been completely disregarded, and our excuses not  accepted, we, after some time, seeing the demand reiterated, thought of complying’  with it by way of acknowledgment for the great favours and attentions we owed to  that illustrious individual, and promised him to undertake the task as soon as we  should have returned to Cairo. We therefore set off for that city, and quitted  Damascus with the greatest sorrow and regret, leaving our heart with the kind and  benevolent people by whom we had been so hospitably received, and so generously  treated.    Agreeably to our promise, some time after our arrival at Cairo we began the task  we had taken on our shoulders, and before many weeks had elapsed we wrote a  good portion of it, which would have charmed the eyes and hearts of the lovers of  composition ; we followed in its arrangement the most frequented paths, we orna-  mented it with the most precious jewels from the East and West, and we spared no  labour to make it acceptable for the learned. But after this we were suddenly  seized with a desire to leave our work unfinished ; and our idleness representing to  us this resolution of ours as an equitable one, we were first led to postpone it, as the  debtor postpones the payment of his debt to his generous creditor, and little by little  to lay it aside, and then at last to think of not completing what we had begun ; thus  striking the long space of time we had spent in its composition from the sum of our  deserts, deviating from the mark of the arrow of our intention, and leaving in the  deep shadows of night descriptions of things and ideas which had never occurred to  the mind of any other author. We were persevering in this determination when  a letter of that noble Lord came, announcing to us that no excuse whatsoever would  be received for the non-fulfilment of our promise, and that he waited in the greatest  anxiety the completion of our task; so we were obliged to return to our work,  and, spurred by his eloquent and affectionate letter, in which he urged us on to the  pursuit, we once more took the pen in our hand, decided not to lay it aside until we  had brought our undertaking to an end.?",62,,
"    THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE. 11    We were fast advancing in our work, when it occurred to us that were we to add  to our former plan the history of Andalus, and what Islam performed in it, as  well as a description of the manifold advantages which that country possesses, and  the heroic deeds of its inhabitants ; were we to transcribe such select pieces in prose  and verse as would give the scholar an idea of the literary accomplishments of the  Andalusians, and to say enough of its history and antiquities to fill the cup of the  lover of those sciences, we might, without deviating from our path, (since all this  falls within the scope of our subject,) make an important addition to our intended  work. We had, it is true, while residing in the Maghreb (West), when the shades  of youth were declining towards their evening, and when the high regions of  thought were getting out of the reach of the attacks of fate, laboured hard on the  history of Andalus ; we had collected for the description of that country and its  inhabitants (two subjects to fill with delight the hearts and souls of the lovers of  science) the most interesting and valuable documents, and the most curious and  complete written as well as oral information; we had described minutely the  aptitude and superiority of the Andalusians in the sciences, their forwardness  and courage in attacking the cruel enemy of God; the enchanting beauties of the  spots which they formerly inhabited, the sites of their contests and battles ; of all  which we had amassed treasures enough to satisfy the wishes and ambition of the  most excellent and scrupulous historian, and collected a sufficient number of unique  pearls to bewitch the minds of the readers, and gathered in the delightful paths of  their literature flowers enough to gratify the senses of the studious, and strung  together many useful and hitherto unknown things, in a manner to make the eyes  of the learned and ingenious start out of their orbits with pleasure and astonishment :  all this, moreover, was written by us in such an elevated and pleasing style, that  had it been publicly delivered by the common crier, it would have made even the  stones deaf.    But, alas! the whole of this we had left in Maghreb with the rest of our library ;  so that we had nothing to assist us in our gigantic undertaking but what little still  remained impressed on our mind and memory, and a few detached leaves of our  work, which, when inquired for, answered our summons, and happened by chance  to be among our papers: for had we at present with us all we had collected for the  purpose, and what we had ornamented with the inestimable jewels of narration,  all eyes would have been dazzled, and all hearts rejoiced; for certainly it would  have been the most extensive and complete work ever written on the subject. But,  such as it is, we offer it to our readers ; for man is the son of times and circum-",63,,

However, we  have done our best to make it as useful and complete as possible; for he whose  stock of learning is but scanty can only avoid falling into error by extreme and  scrupulous attention and care, as the weak cannot avoid temptation otherwise than  by continually repeating prayers.    Know ye, then, O readers of this book! that when we had determined upon the  completion of our work, we began to think seriously about the most suitable  division of its parts, and the proper arrangement of the information contained in  it. We therefore, after much consideration, divided it into two separate parts,  to each of which we gave a different title, although both make, as it were, the soul  and body of the work, and are equally deserving of the unreserved attention of the  studious. The first part, in order to attain better the object of our work, and for  the sake of brevity, as also in order to curtail some accounts which it would have  been impossible to abridge, and which would have appeared too long, we thought of  dividing into eight chapters.    Chap. I. will contain a description of the island of Andalus, and of its beautiful  climate and mild temperature, which is the same every where; as likewise an  account of the manifold advantages and gifts with which God was pleased to endow  it ; its limits and geographical dimensions ; the fecundity of the ground fertilized by  copious rains; the fruits and productions of its soil; the imposing ruins and  magnificent remains scattered over its surface; as also a detailed account of some  of its principal provinces, with the most remarkable cities contained in them.    Chap. IT. will show how the Moslems conquered Andalus ; and how and at what  time the whole of that extensive country was subdued by their victorious arms,  under the command of Miiza Ibnu Nosseyr, and Térik Ibnu Zeydd, his freedman ;  how its rich plains became the hippodromes wherein the Arabs exercised their  generous steeds, and its fields were converted into pasture-grounds and halting-",64,,

Chap. III. will be a chronological history of such illustrious Moslems as were,  by their sanctity and virtues, the firm supporters of religion, or who, engaged in  perpetual battle with the enemy of God, defeated him morning and evening, never  resting from the fatigues of the holy war, but prosecuting it with incredible ardour  through pain and toil, over hill and dale : it will likewise contain an account of the  disposition and forwardness of the Andalusians to face the enemy on every occasion, ©  relate some of their heroic deeds and praiseworthy actions, and inform the readers  of their constancy and ardour in observing the holy precepts of their Sunnah, and  defending them with drawn swords against the attacks of the infidels.    Chap. IV. will give the history of Cordova, that illustrious capital and seat  of the Khalifs, from which the conquerors sallied out who trod on the necks of the  impious Christians, and brought down their pride ;—of its great mosque, built by the  Sultans of the family of Merwan, and decorated with glittering magnificence, and  works of art dazzling to the eye ;—of the manifold beauties contained in the two  royal seats in its neighbourhood, namely, Medinatu-z-zahr4, built by An-ndssir, and  Medinatu-z-zéhirah, which Al-mansiir erected ;—of the numerous pleasure-gardens  and other spots of recreation in which its environs abound; the extensive and  fertile territory, with its productions of every kind ;—and lastly, several anecdotes  and historical accounts which are intimately connected with this subject, and will  fill with delight the hearts of the acute and the studious.    Chap. V. will be entirely consecrated to the history of those Andalusians who  quitted their native country to travel into the distant regions of the East, and to  enter the territories pure from contamination, and free from heresy; as also to  commemorate the praises which the said eminent doctors, the endowed with superior  minds and virtuous propensities, lavished on Damascus, that mole on earth’s cheek,  that terrestrial Paradise; together with such information respecting its principal  orators and best writers among its present inhabitants as we deemed necessary to  illustrate our narrative. It will also contain the conversations which these illus-  trious individuals, whose well-directed arrows always hit the mark of their in-  tention, notwithstanding that their modesty and self-denial are excessive, held  with the despicable and unworthy writer of the present work, when, dismounting  from the camel of peregrination, he alighted amongst them, in the year one",65,,

Chap. VI. A biography of several Eastern worthies, who, guided by the torch  of direction, which was rapidly being extinguished in their own country, bent their  steps towards Andalus, where they implanted, by their stay, the seeds of virtue and  learning ; and who, on their return to their native land, delighted the ears of their  audience with tales respecting the countries they had visited.    Chap. VII. A sketch of the manifold gifts that God Almighty has lavished upon  the people of Andalus, such as quickness of intellect, power of reason, strength of  imagination, and retentiveness of memory ;—their prodigal expenditure in the acqui-  sition of knowledge, and their wonderful efforts to arrive at fame ;—their superiority  in all the branches of literature, as likewise some of their witty sayings and clever  answers, their jokes, epigrams, satirical traits, and some selections from their  writings ; all tending to show their aptitude for science and literature, and their  undeniable pre-eminence and superiority in all the branches of learning.    Chap. VIII. How the impious enemy of God subdued the island of Andalus, after  putting in practice all his treasons and deceits against it, surrounding it with his  circumventing nets, and exciting dissensions and civil wars among the kings and  chiefs of the Moslems ;—how the shrewd Christian acted, and how he conducted  himself, until (may God confound him, and extirpate his progeny to the last !) he  conquered all the territories which acknowledged the sway of Islam, and obliterated  from them the worship of the only God, substituting that of the Trinity and its  abominable rites, inscribing its name with the hands of sacrilege and impiety on the  threshold of the temples and other places of worship consecrated to the only and  indivisible God.—How the Andalusian Moslems (of Granada), surrounded on every  side by the enemies of their faith, solicited in eloquent epistles, either in prose or  verse, the assistance and help of their Moslem brethren of the East and West ; and  how, their entreaties being disregarded, under the plea that the enemy guarded all  the avenues to that city, and that their forces were not sufficiently numerous to con-  tend with the various nations of Christians who besieged it, they fell helpless and  unarmed into the hands of their cruel enemy. May God restore to it the words  of Islam, and re-establish in it the laws of his blessed messenger, the Lord of the  Creation, (upon whom be blessing and salutation !) and expel from it and the sur-  rounding countries all the infidel nations !",66,,
"    THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE. 15    Such will be the division'* and arrangement of the first part of this work, in  which we have not introduced any chapter respecting the Wizir Lis4nu-d-din ; for,  as the reader will see, the second, which forms the bulk of this work, is exclusively  consecrated to him, the first part being only, as it were, an episode in the life of that  eminent and illustrious individual.    As to the title which we have chosen for our work, we must state that our first  thought was to name it ‘“‘ Sweet Odour emanating from the History of the Wizir  Lisinu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattfb ;”'® but, when we determined upon adding to our plan  the history of Andalus, we changed our mind, and entitled it, “‘ Fragrant Smell from  tender shoots of Andalus, and the History of the Wiztr Lisénu-d-din Ibnu-l-  khattib.”*© We must add that we were not a little stimulated to the composition  of the work, and to divide it in the manner we have just described, by several  reasons: the first and principal, because the individual who was the cause of the  composition of this work was himself a native df Syria, and born in the illustrious  city of Damascus ; the second, that the conquerors of Andalus were for the most  part Syrians, all men of courage and determination ; the third, that the greatest  part of the Arab families who settled in Andalus in the first centuries after the  conquest, fixing therein their permanent residence, and carrying with them wherever  they went prosperity and power, were originally from Syria; and lastly, that the  city of Granada was chiefly inhabited by people from Damascus, who, struck by the  resemblance which that former city bore to the capital of Syria, in its palaces,  rivers, abundance of trees, and profusion of flowers, named it after their native city.    We shall now beseech the readers to look at this our book with the eyes of  indulgence; not to inquire further into the motives of its being written, nor to  think about him who was the principal cause of its composition ; but, putting aside  all these and other considerations, to place all their reliance and trust in its contents,  to forgive such errors as they may detect, and to pardon the mistakes and want  of judgment of the author. We further request them not to examine our narrative  with the eyes of close criticism, whenever they see us struggling either with the  obscurities of the language, or with the insurmountable difficulties of history ; but  to treat us with indulgence, and to consider, that although our work may not satisfy  their wishes, yet it is not altogether devoid of utility and interest ; and it may lead  them to the discovery of more precious information. For our part, we are satisfied  with our most intimate conviction of not having spared either time, expense, or  labour, to render this book as useful and agreeable as possible, and feel confident  that very few works will be found to surpass the present, or even to compete with",67,,

We therefore consider it as a  valuable gift, and as such we hope that it will be received with open arms by all  lovers of learning and information.    In the course of our narrative we have occasionally introduced quotations, in  prose and verse, from various writers, especially whenever we deemed it expedient  or necessary for the illustration of our subject ; and we have likewise brought in  such anecdotes of Kings, Wizirs, Kadis, Poets, and ther learned men, as we  thought would be an example for future generations, and a salutary admonition for  all our readers.",68,,

In the name of God, whose assistance we humbly beseech and implore, we shall  begin by describing the Island of Andalus,—a country whose excellences are so  numerous, and of such a kind, that they cannot easily be contained within the limits  of abook, and that no words can be found sufficiently strong to give an idea of  them. For our part, we consider Andalus as the prize of the race won by the  horsemen who, at the utmost speed of their chargers, subdued the regions of the    East and West.   Respecting the etymology of its name different opinions prevail ; some authors, Etymology of  like Ibnu Sa’id,' derive it from Andalus, son of Tubal, son of Yafeth, son of Nuh, « Andalus.”  who settled in it, and gave it his name, in like manner as his brother Sebt, son  of Yafeth, peopled the opposite land, and gave his name to the city of Sebtah  (Ceuta). Ibnu Ghélib? follows the same opinion, but makes Andalus to be the son  of Y4feth. Ibnu Hayyén,? Ibnu Khaldin,* and others, derive it from Andalosh,®  a nation of barbarians who settled there. This latter opinion seems the most  probable ; but God is all-knowing.   The country of Andalus (may God restore it entire to the Moslems !) has been Cimate.  described both by native and foreign writers in the most pompous terms. The  Wizir Lisénu-d-din® Ibnu-l-khattib, (may God show him mercy!) in one of his  historical works, says as follows: ‘‘ God Almighty has distinguished this our  “country by endowing it with gentle hills and fertile plains, sweet and wholesome   VOL. 1.

He has also endowed its inhabitants with great aptitude for  “« the sciences and the arts of domestic life ; acuteness of mind, quickness of intel-  “ lect ; courage, ardent love of every thing which is noble, and many other brilliant  “« qualities, which are not to be found united in people of any other country.”   Abt ’Obeyd-illah Al-bekri Al-andalusi? compares his native country to Shém  (Syria) for purity of air and sweetness of waters, to Yemen for mildness of tempera-  ture, which is every where the same, to Hind (India) for drugs and aromatic plants,  to Al-ahwéz® for the magnitude of its snakes, to China for mines and precious  stones, to ’Aden for the number and security of its coasts and harbours.   Abi ’A’mir As-salémi,® in his work entitled ‘ Durru-I-kildyid wa ghurruru-l-  fawdyid, (pearls of the necklaces, and stars of useful things,) says that Andalus  belongs to the climate of Sham (Syria) ; that which, of all those into which the  earth is divided, is reckoned the best and most temperate, which has the finest land  and waters, and which abounds most in animals, fruits, and productions of all kinds :  “ that climate,” he adds, ‘‘ occupies a middle place among the other climates, and  ‘is therefore considered the best, it being well known that the most preferable  “« portion of any thing is that which is in the middle.”   The Sheikh Ahmed Ibn Mohammed Ibn Misa Ar-rézi!® says that Andalus  is situated at the extremity of the fourth climate towards the West, and that  all learned authors agree in describing it as a country with delightful valleys,  and fertile lands, rich in all sorts of agricultural productions, watered by many  large rivers, and abounding in springs of the sweetest waters. It contains but  few wild beasts, or venomous reptiles ; the air in winter is mild, and the coolest  breezes temper the heat of summer. The climate is so temperate all the year  round as to make the transition from one season to another almost imperceptible ;  in fact, it may be said that a perpetual spring reigns all over Andalus, this  being the reason why most of the fruits of earth grow in all seasons, and the  crops succeed one another without interruption ; owing, too, to the different  qualities of the soil, the same produce may be obtained all the year round in  various provinces of Andalus ; as, for instance, on the coast and the lands adjoining  to it all fruits of the earth are very forward, while in the Thagher™ and its  districts, and especially on the mountains, where the air is colder, they are, on  the contrary, very backward. Most of its fruits, also, partake of a flavour and  beauty which are not common to those of other countries.’?   That Andalus is situate in the fourth climate appears sufficiently demonstrated",70,book_1,chapter_1
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 19    by the words of the geographer Idrisi, as quoted by Ibnu Sa’id: ‘‘ Andalus,”  says that author, ‘‘has no portion of its territory within the third climate, but  “the fourth passes by its southern coast, and includes Cordova, Seville, Murcia,  “and Valencia; thence it goes towards Sicily, encloses this and other islands in  “the neighbourhood, leaving the sun at the back. The fifth passes by Toleytoleh  “ Toledo), Sarakostah (Saragossa) and the environs; then by Arghon’* (Aragon),  “at the southern extremity of which is the city of Barshelénah (Barcelona), thence  “it proceeds to Rome and the country subject to that city, divides the Bahru-l-  “ Banddikeh (Gulf of Venice) into two parts, and comprises Costantiniyeh the  “ great (Constantinople) and its territory, leaving behind the planet called  “ Az-zahrah (Venus). The sixth passes by the northern coast of Andalus,  “that which is washed by the waters of the circumambient sea, includes part of  “ Castile* and Portugal,'® a great portion of the country of the Franks, Georgia,  “and the country of the Sclavonians and Russians, leaving behind the planet  “called ’Ottdrid (Mercury). The seventh comprises the circumambient sea to  “the north of Andalus, the island called Alinkilterrah'® (England) and others  “in the neighbourhood, as well as the remainder of the countries of the Franks  “and Sclavonians, Georgia, and Berjén.'""""—According to Al-beyhaki'® the island  “ of Tili,’® and the two islands of Al-ajbél? (Norway) and An-nisé”! (Amazones)  “and several other districts of Russia, fall within the limits of this seventh and  “ last climate, which has the moon at its back.”   Respecting the name of Al-jeztrah (the island) by which all authors agree in  designating Andalus, it must not be understood by it that that country is, properly  speaking, an island ; since it is well known to be joined to the great land (continent)  by the chain of mountains called Al-bort™ (Pyrenees), but the Arabs in general  all by this name all those countries which are surrounded by water on every side  but one, and this being the case with Andalus, it was called Al-jeztrah. Two  principal seas wash the shores of Andalus; on the northern and western side  the circumambient sea (Ocean), on the southern and eastern the sea of Shdm  (Mediterranean). By the sea of Shém we understand that sea which begins at  the lower extremity of Andalus, at a place on its south-western coast called  Jeziratu-l-khadhrdé® (Algesiras), between Tangiers in Africa and the coast of  Andalus, taking from thence its course towards Syria. The width of this sea  at the said spot is generally stated at eighteen’ miles ; which is also the dis-  tance between Jezirah Tarif* (Tarifa) and Kasr Masmiidah* (Alcasar), near  Ceuta. Between these two last mentioned places there was once a bridge,  which, according to common opinion, Iskhander (Alexander) ordered to be built,",71,book_1,chapter_1

But of this  more will be said in the course of this narrative.   The narrow sea thus emergmg from between the two coasts was called  Bahru-z-sokdk™ (the narrow sea). Although the distance between the two  shores is so small, as we have already observed, this strait is nevertheless  very difficult to be passed, owing to the continual agitation of its waves, and  the frightful whirlpools occasioned by the meeting of the two seas. We have  said that the width of the straits at the narrowest part was eighteen miles ; it  is double that width at Ceuta, and from thence the sea begins to grow wider  and wider, until at some places it reaches 800 miles in breadth, or perhaps  more ; as happens at Stir (Tyre), on the coast of Syria. This sea contains  many islands, which some geographers estimate to be twenty-eight in number,  and of which the principal are Sicily, Malta, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, Corfu, and  so forth.   The dimensions of the country are differently stated: Al-mes’idi,” in his  “« Golden Meadows,” says, ‘‘ Andalus is very thickly peopled ; nearly two months  ‘of continual marching are required to traverse it from one end to the other.  “Tt contains nearly forty cities of the first rank.” Ibn Alisa’ *® agrees with  Al-mes’idi in this particular ; his opinion is that the length of Andalus from  Ariénah ® (Narbonne) to Ishbénah (Lisbon) is equal to the distance that a horse-  man well mounted may travel in sixty days; but this is decidedly an error, first  of all because Narbonne is, by that author, placed within the limits of Andalus,  while it is evident that it belongs to another country; and secondly, because the  distance between those two cities is much overrated, as most of the authors who  have written on the subject estimate it at only one month and a half’s march.   Tbnu Sa’id, however, endeavours to adjust the difference by supposing that  Tbn Alisa’ meant a horseman not well mounted, and travelling by short stages,  and that his text was vitiated by the copyist. He himself adopts the computation  of the Sherif Idrisi as that which deserves more credit, namely, that the length  of Andalus is of one month’s march. The same opinion is followed by Al-hijéri,°  who, having, as he informs us, consulted with well informed and trustworthy  travellers on the subject, learnt from them that a little more than a month’s  good travelling was sufficient to traverse Andalus in its whole length.   The last mentioned author (Al-hijéri) estimates the distance from Lisbon to  Al-hdjiz*' (the Pyrenees) at more than one thousand miles, but whoever wishes  to obtain more information on the subject may consult Ibnu Sa’id, who has  treated the matter at full length.",72,book_1,chapter_1
"    cHaP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 21    The width of Andalus measured at the top, towards the north-east, is forty  miles, this being the length of those mountain barriers which separate it from  the country of the Franks, and which stretch along from the Mediterranean to  the Ocean ; if measured at the centre, as for instance drawing a line to pass by  Toledo, it is sixteen days’ march.   Its shape, according to all accounts, is that of a triangle; much difference, Shape.  however, exists among geographers respecting its north-eastern*? angle, namely,  that which falls in the neighbourhood of Narbonne: some authors, like Ahmed  Ibn Mohammed Ar-rézi and Ibnu Hayyén, placing it in Narbonne, a city imme-  diately facing Bordhil (Bourdeaux)** on the north-east ; while others only place  it in the neighbouring districts. But this, as well as other points concerning  the topography of Andalus, has been decided by the Sherif Idrisi, an author  in whose accounts implicit reliance may be placed, not only because he traversed  that country in all directions, navigated its seas, and surveyed its coasts, but  also on account of the great knowledge he acquired in the science of geography.   The words of Ar-r4zi on the subject are as follows: ‘‘ The shape of Andalus  “is that of a triangle, the angles of which are placed, one at Kadis (Cadiz), where  “stands the famous tower with an idol at the top, or rather at that spot on the  “extreme south where the Mediterranean begins, directing its course to the east.  “The other to the east of Andalus, between the cities of Narbonne and Bordhil,  “ which are now in the hands of the Franks, falling diametrically opposite to the  “two islands of Mayércah (Mallorca) and Mendércah (Menorca), and at an equal  “distance from the Ocean and Mediterranean, which in those parts are separated  “only by an intervening tract of land called Al-abwdb (the Gates), being gorges  “or passes which serve as a communication between the island of Andalus and  “the great land (continent) of which Afranjah (France) forms part. At this  “ place the distance between the two seas is of two days’ march, Narbonne being  “on the coast of the Mediterranean, and Bordhil facing the Ocean. The third  “angle is placed in the north-west, in that spot of the country of Jalikiyah  “ (Galicia), where there is a mountain near the sea, and on it a very high tower,  “with an idol on the top, similar to that of Kadis, and looking towards Birtdéniah  “ (Britain).”   Tbnu Sa’id says, ‘“ having once asked the opinion of several men learned in  “these matters, I was told that Idrisi’s statement seemed the most worthy of  “being received, namely, that neither Narbonne nor Bordhil were within the  “limits of Andalus, and therefore that the angle in the east must be placed  “between the cities of Barshelénah (Barcelona) and Tarkénah (Tarragona), at  “a spot called Wéddi-Zanlakalto,* close to the mountain barrier which there",73,book_1,chapter_1
"    Ancient divi-  sions.    22 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book 1.    * divides Andalus from the continent, where many different languages are spoken.  ‘“‘ These mountains have several passes or gates, which a Grecian king* ordered  “to be opened in the rock with fire, vinegar, and iron, for before his time there  ‘* was no communication whatsoever by land between Andalus and the continent.  “The said gates or passes face that part of the Bahru-z-zokdk (Mediterranean)  “‘ which divides the two islands of Mallorca and Menorca, this being a fact which  ** is corroborated by the assertions of all travellers in those districts. The second  “and third angles are placed by Idrisi in the same situation that the authors  “before mentioned agree in giving them, viz., in the promontory called ’Ajma’u-  “ [-bahrdnt,® near the city of Shant Yakéh (Santiago) in Galicia, where the  ‘“‘ famous beacon stands; and in the mountain of Al-aghar,*”7 near Cadiz, the  “‘ site of the well-known tower which has an idol on the top of it. Near this  “* mountain, in a south-west direction, is the spot where the Bahru-z-zokdk (narrow  “ sea) emerges from the Ocean, and from whence, after washing the southern and  “* eastern coasts of Andalus, it reaches one side of the Pyrenees.”   Andalus was divided, following the words of Ar-rézi, into two parts :—Andalus  Al-gharbé (Western), and Andalus Ash-sharki (Eastern), the division having been  made according to the prevailing winds, the fall of the rains, and the course of  the rivers. The Gharbi (weStern) was that part of Andalus whose rivers empty  their waters into the Western Ocean, and where it rains when the winds blow  from the western quarter ; the Sharkt (eastern), which was also called Al-aksd,  or the remote, being, on the contrary, that whose rivers flow to the east, and  where it rains when the easterly winds blow. The dividing line between these  two districts was placed by Ar-r4zi in the mountains of the Basques (Al-bashkans)  towards the east, from thence drawing a line to the city of Santa Maria,** then  inclining a little towards the district of Agreda, in the neighbourhood of Toledo,  and at last approaching that part of the Mediterranean which washes the shores of  the modern Cartagena, which belongs to the district of Lércah (Lorca). All the  countries falling eastward of this line were therefore comprised within the limits  of Eastern Andalus, and those to the west within those of Western Andalus. The  boundaries of the latter were: to the north-west, and west, the Ocean; to the south  the Western Sea, whence the Mediterranean, which the ancients called also  Bahr Tirren,® issues to take its course towards Syria. Bahr Tirren means the  sea that divides the globe: it was called also the Great Sea.‘   Abi Bekr ’Abdullah Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakam, known by the surname of Ibn An-  nadhdhém,""' treating of the said division, adds a few particulars which we repeat  here for the sake of information. ‘‘ Andalus,” he says, ‘‘ was divided into two  “« parts by ancient geographers, who observed that whenever winds from the west",74,book_1,chapter_1
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 23    “ prevailed, it ‘rained much in Western Andalus, and there was drought in the  “ Eastern; and, on the contrary, when the wind blew from the east, rain fell  “in abundance in the Eastern, and the Western was dry and parched. The  “same difference was observed respecting the course of rivers, for all the rivers  “in Western Andalus flow from the east to the west, forcing their way through  “ those mountains *? that traverse it in the middle, and are only a branch detached  “from the mountains in the north-western districts. In the Eastern all rivers  “flow from west to east, for although some of them take a more southern  “ direction, yet they all spring from the said mountains in the centre of Andalus,  “and discharge their waters into the Mediterranean, which goes on to Syria,  “and is known also by the name of Bahru-r-rimi (the sea of Greece). As to  “the rivers of the north-western districts** (Al-Juf), including those of the  “country of the Galicians, and its dependencies, all empty themselves into the  ‘ preat ocean (Atlantic), which washes the shores of those countries.”   The same author (Ibn An-nadhdhém) says that the first people who, after the First setters  deluge, settled in Andalus, according to the accounts of foreign writers, were a ‘*""""""""*  nation called Andalush, who gave their name to the country. This word Andalush  being in the course of time corrupted by the Arabs, who changed the letter shin  into sin, it was written and pronounced Andalus, which is the present name of  this country.“ Those barbarians came to Andalus and settled in it; and their  numbers having increased considerably, in the course of time they filled the whole  country and established different kingdoms in it. But being idolaters (Majis), |  and otherwise inclined to depravity and corruption, they lived in entire disobedience :  to the divine precepts, until God Almighty, perceiving their obstinacy, withdrew \  the rain from them, and the whole country was thereby exposed to the most  dreadful sterility ; fountains sank into the bowels of the earth, rivers altered their  course, trees dried up, plants withered, and both men and beasts experienced  the most raging thirst, owing to which most of the inhabitants perished, with the  exception of a few who escaped from death by flying into distant lands. Thus  freed from these people, Andalus became a desert, and continued so for one  hundred years,** for that great calamity was not confined to any part of its territory,  but ravaged the whole country from the Pyrenees to the furthest extremity in the  Western or Green Sea. The reign of ‘the Andalush had lasted one hundred and  odd years.   At last, after Andalus had remained in that state for the said period of years, Africans.  God Almighty was pleased to send other settlers; these were certain people  whom the king of Africa had banished his dominions, because of their having  excited sedition in his state, and instigated his subjects to revolt against him.",75,book_1,chapter_1

After making war against them until they were nearly exterminated, he caused  the few who remained to be embarked on board some vessels, and giving them  for commander an officer of the name of Batrikus, he allowed them to go whither  they pleased. Batrikus and his men first cast anchor at a place on the western  shore of Andalus, and settled at Cadiz. Having afterwards advanced into the  interior of the country, they found that, owing to the fall of rain, the land had  recovered its former aspect, the fields were adorned with verdure, the rivers flowed,  the fountains ran, and the trees were covered with leaves. Encouraged by what  they saw, they proceeded still farther, spread themselves about the country,  extended their settlements, built cities and towns, and increased their numbers  by marriage. However, they settled in preference in that part of the country  hetween the place of their landing in the west, and the country of the Franks  in the east, and appointed kings to rule over them and administer their affairs.  Their religion was the same as that of their predecessors in the country, that is,  they worshipped idols. They fixed their capital at Talikah (Italica), a city now  in ruins, and which once belonged to the district of Ishbiliah (Seville). But,  after a period of one hundred and fifty-seven years, during which eleven kings  of that race reigned over Andalus, God Almighty permitted that they should all  be annihilated by the barbarians of Rome, who invaded and conquered the country.  “ After the defeat and destruction of the Africans, the empire of Andalus  “ devolved to the people of Rome and their king Ishbén, son of Titus, after  ‘‘whom Andalus was called Ishbdniah. Some authors assert that the real name  “of this king was Isbahdén, and that he was called so on account of his being  “born in the city of Isfahén; only that the barbarians corrupted it and called  “him Ishban ; but, be this as it may, certain it is that this king Ishbin founded  “ Seville, and called it after his name Ishbaniah, which in after time became also  ‘the appellation of the whole country, owing to the numerous ruins of works  “‘ and edifices erected by him, which are still visible in many parts of Andalus.  “This king Ishbén is generally held as one of the conquerors of the earth. He  “‘ invaded Andalus, and by the favour of God, who gave victory to his arms, he  “made war against the inhabitants, dispersed their armies, slaughtered and cap-  “tured their men, and besieged them at last in their capital, the city of Italica.  “* The Africans made a most desperate resistance, and, the place being very strong,  ‘held out a considerable time, until Ishban, impatient of the delay, caused the  “city of Seville to be built opposite to Italica, and, pressing on the siege, took it  “by storm. By the taking of Italica, which he ordered to be demolished, and  “its marbles and effects carried to his new city, the whole of Andalus submitted  “to Ishban, who, having completed the building of Seville, chose it for his court",76,book_1,chapter_1
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 25    “and residence, established his authority permanently, increased his armies, and  “pursued his career of conquest. Scarcely two years had elapsed when he  “sailed from Seville with a fleet, attacked Ilia‘” which is the same as Al-Kods  (Jerusalem) the illustrious, plundered and de. ~lished it, killed one hundred  “thousand Jews, spared one hundred thousand, an. <aused its marbles and  “effects to be transported to Andalus. This Ishb4n further subdued all his  “enemies, and his reign was very prosperous.” The preceding account is taken,  word for word, from Ibn An-nadhdh4m. We may add to it what a certain historian  says to prove the taking of Jerusalem, although he attributes the conquest to  another king, namely, that most of the wonderful things which the Moslems  found among the spoils of Andalus at the time of the conquest, such as the  table of Suleymén, son of Datid, (upon whom be peace!) which Térik Ibn  Zeyad found in a temple at Toledo, and the pearl necklace taken by Misa Ibn  Nosseyr from the church at Merida, as well as a great many other precious objects  and jewels, of which a more ample description will be given hereafter, were part  of the share in the spoil which, at the taking of Jerusalem by Bokht Nasser,  fell to the lot of a king of Spain, whose name was Beridn,** and who was present  at the conquest of that city. The whole of these precious objects had been in  former times the property of the Prophet Suleyman, son of. Daiid, for whose use  the Jinn had constructed them. How the contradictory accounts of these two  historians are to be adjusted we cannot decide, unless Ishbén and Beridn be the  same person: God only is all-knowing.   To return to Ishb4n. Ibnu Hayyén, in his historical work entitled “ the book tshbén.  “of the seeker of information respecting the History of the Barbarians,”“? says  that this Ishban was once a very poor man from the lower ranks of society, and  as he was one day engaged in ploughing a field with his oxen, Al-khadher ® (on  whom be peace !) appeared before him, and addressed him thus: “‘ O Ishban, thou  “ art destined to perform great deeds; thou shalt reign, and thy fame shall spread  “far and wide. When thou takest Ilia, be kind to the descendants of the  “ Prophet.”” And Ishb4n answered, ‘“ Thou art jesting, no doubt, or I am not  ‘“‘ the person thou meanest, for I am a poor and weak man, and am obliged to  “hire out my services to gain a living, and certainly it is not for people of my  “class that the empire is reserved.” “‘ No matter,” replied Al-khadher, ‘“ what  “‘T tell thee is the plain truth; it is predestined, and it shall happen: He has  “decreed it who has the power to change that dry rod thou bearest in thy  “hand into a green bough.” Ishban looked, when lo! it suddenly turned  green, flourished, and was covered with leaves.

How-  ever, the words of the Prophet remaining deeply impressed on his mind, he began  to turn over what had been said to him, and the result was that he soon after-  wards left his master’s service, and associated with men of courage and deter-  mination, amongst whom he became conspicuous for his prowess, until he arrived  at power and performed what has been related. His reign lasted twenty years,  and he transmitted the empire to his posterity, of whom fifty-five kings ruled  over Andalus.   After this the country was invaded by other barbarians coming from Rome,  and called Bishtilikat,** who, with their king Talubush,*? son of Beytah, at their  head, arrived in Andalus, after conquering on their way the country of the  Franks, which they governed by their prefects. This took place about the  time of the resurrection of the Massih (anointed), son of Mariim, (on whom be  peace!) They conquered the whole of Andalus, and fixed their court at Merida,  remaining in undisturbed possession of the country during the reign of twenty-  seven monarchs, until they themselves were subdued by the Goths, who with  their king at their head invaded Andalus, and separated it for ever from the  empire of Rome.   The Goths fixed their capital at Tolétalah (Toledo). However, Ishbiliah still  continued to be the abode of the sciences, and the dwelling-place of the most  noble among the Ishbdnians. About this time the Apostles sent by ""Isa Al-massih  (the anointed) began to wander about the world, calling the people to his  religion. In some countries their words were heard, and thousands of people  embraced the religion which they preached ; in others they were unheard, and  put to death. Among those who adopted their creed, and honoured the Apostles,  was Khoshandinus* (Constantine), king of the Goths, who not only embraced  Christianity, but called upon his subjects to do the same. This Khoshandinus is held  by the Christians as the greatest king they ever had, and as the most accomplished,  upright, virtuous, and wise monarch that can be imagined. It was he who  introduced Christianity into his dominions, where it has flourished ever since,  and used to decide in all law cases with the assistance of the Gospels, those books  upon which various opinions prevail, as also upon their writers or compilers.  Several kings of the posterity of Khoshandinus reigned after him in Andalus,  until that country was finally subdued by the Arabs, by whose means God  Almighty was pleased to make manifest the superiority of Islam over every  other religion.’   The number of kings of Gothic descent who reigned over Andalus ‘is stated  in the old Christian chronicles to have been thirty-six, from Atdnduinus,“ who",78,book_1,chapter_1
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 27    reigned in the fifth year of the Emperor Filibus,* in 407 of the era of Safar,**  from which the barbarians compute their years, to Ludherik, their last king,  who reigned in 749% of the said era; and in whose time the Arabs conquered  Andalus and overthrew the Gothic empire: their domination, moreover, is said  to have lasted 342 years.   However, there are not wanting authors who make of the Goths and the  Bishtilikaét only one nation, but the generality think, as we have said, that they  were distinct people, that the latter were the barbarians of Rome, that they fixed  their court at Merida, and that the kings of their race were twenty-seven in  number ; that the Goths came afterwards, subdued the country, and made the  city of Toledo the seat of their empire. All agree, however, in stating the number  of their kings to be thirty-six. The Goths, according to Ar-r4zi, are the sons  of Yajuj, son of Y4feth, son of Nuh; others give them a different origin.   Before leaving the subject of the ancient history of Andalus, we deem it proper  to transcribe here the words of the K4di-l-kod4 Ibnu Khaldin Al-hadhrami,**  in his great historical work. ‘‘ The opposite land,” he says, ‘‘ which the barbarians  “call Andalush, is inhabited by various nations of western Franks, among which  “the most powerful and numerous are the Jalalcah (Galicians). Hundreds of  “vears before the manifestation of Islam, the Goths, after fighting many battles  “with the Latins, laid siege to their capital, the city of Rome ; after this, peace  ‘was made between them, one of the conditions being that the Goths should  “go to Andalus ; and they accordingly went to that country and took possession  “of it. When the Greeks and Latins embraced Christianity, they induced the  “nations of Franks and Goths who dwelt beyond them in the west to do the  “same, and they accordingly became Christians. The Goths, who had possession  “of Andalus, established their capital in Toledo ; but it was not always so, for in  “ the course of time their kings resided by turns in Seville, Cordova, or Merida,  “besides the above-mentioned city. Their dominion lasted for nearly 400 years,  “until God Almighty was pleased to spread Isl4m and conquest over their  “country. Their king at that time was named Ludherik, an appellation generally  “given by the Goths to their kings, as the Romans call their emperor Kaysar  “ (Cesar), and the Sicilians name their king Jerjiz.” ©   If we are to believe the ancient traditions, Iskhander (Alexander) must also have Iskhander  ""resided. in Andalus ; the remains, too, of a bridge erected by him, between Tangiers fodalue.  and Algesiras, are reported by Idrisi as still existing in his time. The building  of the bridge originated thus: It is generally asserted that, in times of old, the  Mediterranean was a lake surrounded by land on every side, like the sea of",79,book_1,chapter_1

Tabaristén (the Caspian sea), whose waters have no communication whatsoever  with those of other seas, and that Andalus and the opposite land of Africa were  joined together so as to form only one continent, owing to which the people  of the remote West (Maghrebu-l-aksa) were continually making incursions into  Andalus, and visiting its inhabitants with destruction and war. On the arrival  of Iskhander in Andalus, the people appeared before him, and humbly besought  him that he would put a stop to the hostile incursions of their neighbours, upon  which Iskhander, having taken the subject into consideration, called together  his architects and geometricians, and bid them appear in his presence on the  spot now occupied by Bahru-z-zok4k (Straits of Gibraltar). He then commanded  them to measure the level of the two seas (the Ocean and Mediterranean), which  being done, the first (the Ocean) was found to be a little the higher. This being  reported to Iskhander, he issued immediate orders for the demolition of all the  cities which stood on the coast of the Mediterranean, enjoining at the same time  that they should be rebuilt farther into the country on more elevated situations.  He next caused a deep trench or canal to be dug between Tangiers and Andalus,  and the digging was carried so deep into the earth that the crests of the mountains  of the lower world became visible.’ When the excavation was completed, a  wharf,” of great dimensions, and built with stone and mortar, an admirable work  of art, was erected all along the coast of Andalus, measuring in length twelve  miles, the distance which then separated the two seas. Another wharf of similar  dimensions was constructed along the coast.of Tangiers, and the space left between  the two was six miles, which is exactly the width of the straits at that spot. This  being done, he caused another great excavation to be made on the side of the  Ocean, and, when every thing was ready, the waters of the great sea (Ocean) were  let into the excavated space between the two wharfs, but with such a fury did they  rush into the Mediterranean that its bed was filled, the neighbouring countries  were inundated, many cities were submerged, and thousands of people perished in  the waves. The waters covered both the wharfs, and rose to a height of eleven  ells. The wharf nearest to Andalus is sometimes visible at low water, when it  looks like a great parallel line; the inhabitants of the two islands® call it Al-  kantarah (the bridge). As to the African one, it is no where visible, having been  completely swallowed up by the waves, which inundated on both sides a piece  of ground measuring twelve miles, and were only checked in their progress by  the mountains on either side. The ports in this strait are, on the side of Africa,  Kasru-l-majéz (Alcasar), Tangiers, and Ceuta; on the side of Andalus, Jebel Tarik  (Gibraltar), Jezirah Tarif (Tarifa), Jeziratu-l-khadhré (Algesiras), and others.",80,book_1,chapter_1

"    Cordova.    30 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book |.    CHAPTER II.    Division of Andalus into three great districts—The central—Cordova—Granada—Toledo—Malaga—  Almeria—Jaen.    Let the reader know that the Island of Andalus, (may God Almighty restore  it entire to the Moslems!) was divided into three great districts, the central, the  eastern, and the western.' The central comprised many cities of the first order,  and which might be called kingdoms, as their jurisdiction extended over populous  districts and large governments, as, for instance, Cordova, Granada, Malaga,  Toledo, Jaen, Almeria.   Among the great cities of Andalus, Cordova has no doubt the preference. Its  mosque, of which we shall treat elsewhere, and the famous bridge called Al-jezr,?  built, according to Ibnu Hayyan, in the Khalifate of ""Omar Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz, and  under the direction of the governor who then administered the affairs of Andalus?  in his name, are objects which have occupied the imagination and wit of the poets.  Amongst others, an Andalusian doctor has said—   “Cordova surpasses all other cities on earth in four principal things: its  ‘“‘ bridge over the Guadalquivir, its great mosque, the city of Az-zahra, and  ‘‘ the sciences therein cultivated.”   The following description occurs in the Al-mishab of Ibnu-l-hijéri:—‘‘ Cordova  “‘ was, during the reign of the Beni Merwan, the cupola of Islam, the meeting place  “ of the learned, the court of the Sultans of the family of Umeyyah, and the re-  “‘ sidence of the most illustrious tribes of Yemen and Ma’d. Students from all  “parts of the world flocked thither at all times to learn the sciences of which  ‘« Cordova was the most noble repository, and to derive knowledge from the mouth  ‘* of the doctors and ulemas who swarmed in it. Cordova is said to have been  “* to Andalus what the head is to the body. Its river is one of the finest in the  “* world, now gliding slowly through level lawns, or winding softly across emerald  “ fields sprinkled with flowers, and serving it instead of robes; now flowing",82,book_1,chapter_2

His answer was the following saying,  so common amongst the people; the North of Cordova is Shammdm, the West  Komdm, the South Moddm, she herself and Baghdad are paradise ; meaning by  Shammdm the beauty of the mountain of Roses, by Kommdm the sweetness of all the  fruits growing in her meadows, and by Moddm her river.®   Another anecdote is told of his father the Sultan Yusef: they say that he once  asked Abi Omran Miisa Ibn Sa’id Al-’ansi® to give his opinion about Cordova,  and to describe its advantages, and that Abi ’Omrdn having declined to do so  unless he heard before what the Sultan himself thought on the subject, the Prince  of the faithful then said, ‘‘ What I know about Cordova is this, that during the  “dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah, and when it was the capital of their empire, its  “limits were considerably enlarged, and its population increased most rapidly ;  “ that its streets, houses, public buildings, and palaces were almost innumerable ;  “ the revenues arising from taxes very considerable, and the productions of agri-  “culture exceedingly plentiful; that a very fine river washes its walls, that the  “ temperature is mild, and lastly, that it is placed in the heart of Andalus. This  ‘is all I know about Cordova.” ‘‘ What then remains for me to say, O Prince of  the faithful!” said Abé Omran.   The Im4m Ibnu Bashkiwél,’ quoting the words of Abi Bekr Ibn Sa’ddeh,®  gives another anecdote respecting Cordova. ‘‘ Abi Bekr,” he says, “and his  “brother travelled upon a certain occasion to Toledo, where, soon after their arrival,  “ they went to visit the Ustedh Abi Bekr Al-makhztimi, who having asked them  “whence they came, Abi Bekr answered ‘ from Cordova ;’ ‘and when?’ said  “ Al-makhzimi ; ‘just now,’ replied Abi Bekr. ‘ Then,’ said the Sheikh, ‘ come  “nearer to me, that I may smell the air of Cordova on thy garments.’ ‘I  ‘approached him,’ says Abi Bekr, ‘and he began to smell my head and to kiss  “it, and then, bidding me to take a pen and paper, he dictated to me the following  “ verses extempore :   ‘O my beloved Cordova! when shall I see thee again! when shall the  ‘time come   ‘When I may see the clouds pouring torrents of rain upon thy western  ‘ quarters, and the thunder shaking with violence the roofs of thy houses.",83,book_1,chapter_2
"    32 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    ‘ Thou art like an enchanted spot; thy fields are luxuriant gardens, thy  * earth of various colours resembles a block of rose-coloured amber.’ ”   But the most elegant description of Cordova that we have read any where is  undoubtedly that contained in the risdleh (epistle) of Ash-shakandi.’ As we shall  often have occasion to refer to it in the course of this work, we deem it necessary to  acquaint the reader with the motives which led to the writing of that composition.  Tbnu Sa’id tells us, on the authority of his father, who was an eye-witness, that a  dispute once arose in presence of Abi Yahya Ibn Abi Zakariyyé, Lord of Ceuta,  between Abi Yahya Ibnu-l-mo’allem, a native of Tangiers, and the Sheikh  Ash-shakandi of Cordova, on the advantages of their respective countries, Africa  and Andalus, each claiming the superiority for the land of his birth: the con-  versation growing warmer, Ash-shakandi said to his opponent, “‘ Were it not for  ‘ Andalus, Africa, thy country, would never have been known, nor would. its  “advantages, whatever they may be, have been justly appreciated, had not. our  ‘historians and poets pointed to them in their writings: were I not afraid of  “ annoying the illustrious individuals in whose company we are, I would soon  ‘ prove to thee the truth of what I advance.” ‘‘ By the Lord,” exclaimed the  Amir, who was lending an attentive ear to the arguments of the contending parties,  * go on, that is just what we want,” and his countenance was all of a sudden  illumined by the rays of vehement curiosity. Ibnu-l-mo’allem then replied—  “ Dost thou really mean to say that excellency and power reside any where else  “but amongst us? Prove it.” Ash-shakandi was on the point of undertaking  the defence of his country, when the Amir interposed and said ‘‘ the subject is  “ too important to be treated thus extempore; let each of you retire, and com-  “ pose a risdleh (epistle) in praise of his own country; you may then treat the  “ subject at large, and I shall be enabled to decide between you.” Ash-shakandi  then produced the master-piece of eloquence and learning to which frequent  allusich will be made in the course of this narrative, and from which we borrow  the following :   ‘Praise be ascribed to God who permitted that there should be in Andalus  “* people to take into their hands the praises of those who distinguished them-  “ selves ; Him who makes lasting whatever he pleases, and who has no one to  ‘‘ oppose him, and no one to find fault with him; since who will call the day  “ darkness ? who will say ugly to a handsome face? I have found a subject  ‘‘ abundant with matter, since I have been endowed with a tongue to express and  “utter. I praise Him because he made me one of his creatures, because he chose  ‘me to be one of those who acknowledge and adore him, because he caused me  “to be sprung from a noble and illustrious race, because he gave me a mind to",84,book_1,chapter_2

He pretends to make Africa superior to Andalus, which  “is as much as to say that the left hand is better than the right, and that night  “is brighter than day; and, O wonder! he wishes to oppose glass beads to  “ inestimable pearls, and to put pebbles by the side of rubies, and low lands on a  “level with inaccessible mountains; he might as well blow on a hearth where  “there is no fire, or go a hunting provided with stones instead of hawks, as  “ presume to make great what God Almighty created small, and to lead astray  “ what He decreed should be a guide.   “Where are thy wits gone? what is become of thy wisdom and penetration,  ‘‘ when the love of thy country has induced thee to extinguish both thy lights, that  “of thy eyes, and that of thy reason? As to thy expression ‘our sovereigns,’ I  ‘‘ must say that they are ours too, as can be proved by those words of a poet-—   ‘One day against us, and another for us; sometimes women, and some-  ‘ times eagles.’ ""!   “ For although it be true that the court of the West is now held in one of your  “ cities, owing to the Khalifate being in the hands of the Sulténs of the family of  ‘“Abdu-l-mimen, (may God Almighty perpetuate it in their hands!) we also  “ have had Sulténs of the Korayshite family, of whom an Eastern poet has said—   ‘I belong to a family of noble and generous people; a race whose march  ‘ is proclaimed by innumerable minarets.   ‘Khalifs among the Moslems; powerful conquerors among the infidels :  ‘ the source of every generous action, the fountain of honour and glory.’   “ And of whom a Western poet has said also—   ‘ Are we not one of the Beni Merwaén; whatever may be our fate, what-  “ ever may be the turn of fortune’s inconstant wheel ?   ‘ Whenever a birth takes place among us does not the earth assume at  ‘ his aspect the appearance of a full moon? do not the minarets quake at  ‘ the sound of his proclamation ?’ #   VoL.

Such, I am told, was the case with the Sclavonian Eunuchs of Al-  “manstr, who rose in their governments after his death, such as Mujéhid,  “ Mundher, and Khayran, not to mention the Arab sovereigns of the dynasties  “of Beni Abbdd, Beni Somddeh, Beni Al-afttas, Beni Dhi-l-niin,?) Beni Hid,  “all of whom were so much praised and extolled by poets, that had the same  “praises been bestowed on night she would have become lighter even than  “day; and the poets never ceased presenting each other with the offerings of  “the sweet-scented gales playing among the flowers, and making upon their  “treasures the attacks of Al-barddh,” until their ambition grew such that one  “of their poets swore that he would not praise a king in a Kasstdeh under  “one hundred dinars, and Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbdd, having heard of it, sent  “for him and ordered him to write one, and used all sorts of persuasion to  “induce him to do it, but he obstinately refused to comply with his wishes  “unless he agreed to give him the sum he asked, it being worthy of remark  “that Al-mu’atamed was not only the most powerful sovereign of his time,  “but one who could bear the least opposition on the part of a subject.   “ One of the greatest acts of generosity that ever a monarch performed towards  “a subject appears in the following anecdote, which is a further illustration of  “what I have advanced. It is related that Abi Ghalib,* the philologist, having  “once written a very fine work, Mujdhid Al-’émiri, who was then king of  “Denia, sent him as a present one thousand dinars, a horse, and a rich suit  “of dress, requesting him at the same time to say that the work had been  “written by his orders.* This, however, Abii Ghalib refused to do, and, sending  “back the present, he gave the following answer—‘ This book I wrote merely  “for the use of the public, and in order that my name might be handed down  “to posterity ; were I to put at the head of it any other name but mine, all",87,book_1,chapter_2

No, I will not consent to it.’ When this answer  “* was brought to Mujahid, instead of being offended, he was much gratified and  ‘* astonished to see the high temper of his soul, and his courage and determination ;  “‘ he returned him the presents, and said—‘ he might at any rate have mentioned  “ me in his book ; this is a thing happening every day ; however, I shall not insist  “any longer.’ :   “ But it being a notorious fact that all the kings of Andalus known by the name  “of ‘ Kings of small states’ vied with each other in filling their capitals with  “learned men and poets, and encouraging by their unusual profuseness all the  “‘ branches of literature, I shall not stop to detail their actions. I shall merely  ‘“‘ remind thee of the princes of the illustrious dynasty of the Beni ’Abbdd, with  ““ whom, as God Almighty has said in his Kordn, reside fruit, palm, and pome-  “ granate, under whose reign every day was a solemn festivity, and who showed  ‘a greater passion for literature than was ever shown by the Beni Hamdan in  “« Aleppo,” and who became, together with their sons, relatives and Wizirs, the centre  “ of eloquence both in prose and in verse, labouring assiduously and unanimously  ‘in the various departments of science ; who left behind them brilliant traces, and  “ everlasting fame, and whose history abounds in generous actions and noble deeds  “ that will last through succeeding ages, and live for ever in the memory of man.  ‘* And if what I advance be not true, by Allah, do tell me the names of countrymen  “of yours who have distinguished themselves in any path whatever before the  “establishment of the present Muhadite dynasty. Dost thou mean Sakmit the  “« Hajib,* or Sdleh Al-baraghwatti? ?” or perhaps Ytsef Ibn Tashfin, who, if he  ‘* acquired any fame, owed it merely to his connexion with Ibn ’Abbdd, who, being  “ the centre of the poets of his time, and the target to which they directed their  ‘« praises and their verses, whenever they treated about him the name of Ytisef was_  “necessarily introduced ; otherwise, I ask you, would he have been known, an  “ ignorant and rude Beydawi as he was? and if not, I will relate to thee the words  “ which they attribute- to him. They say that Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abb4d asked  ‘* Yuisef once, ‘O Prince of the Moslems! dost thou know what these poets say ?’  “« «No, by my soul,’ said Yuisef, “ unless it be that they ask for bread.’ But what  “ T am going to state proves still more his ignorance: when Yusef, some time after  “ this, parted from Al-mu’atamed, and retired to his capital in Africa, the latter  “‘ wrote him an epistle, in which was the following distich :   ‘ Thou art gone, and my sides shake for want of thee, and the water of our  ‘ desert has dried up.   ‘ Thy departure has changed our days into nights, the obscurity of which  ‘ only thy presence can dissipate.’ *",88,book_1,chapter_2

Among its numerous advantages, that of having been the domicile of  “the famous traditionists, Yahya Ibn Yahya* and ’Abdu-l-mélik Ibn Habib,**  “both of whom held traditions from the mouth of Malik Ibn Ans, is not the least  important.  “ They say that when Ibnu Sdreh,** the poet, entered Cordova, he extemporized  “ the following verse :  ‘ ‘ God be praised, I am in Cordova, the abode of science, the throne of the  ‘ Sultans!’",92,book_1,chapter_2
"    CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 4l    “Cordova may be properly called the military camp of Andalus, since it was  “at one time the common meeting-place of those splendid armies which, with  “the help of God, defeated at every encounter the worshippers of the crucified.  “Tt is said of Al-manstir Ibn Abi ’A’mir, that when his authority had been  “ firmly established both in Andalus and in Africa, and his armies and treasures  “had been considerably increased, he held a general review of his troops previous  “to an incursion which he meditated into the enemy’s territory (which was carried  “into effect, and the country subdued). The number of troops which, from the  “various provinces of the empire, assembled on the outskirts of Cordova on this  “memorable occasion is generally stated at 600,000 foot, and 200,000 horse.* -  “Tt is true that since that time the glory and power of Cordova has been  “considerably reduced, but its precincts still swarm with valiant soldiers who  “are continually coming to blows with the infidel, and whose hands are never  “at rest, and many a captain might be named into whose heart fear never  “entered, and whose name is well known in the distant Christian kingdoms,  “where the memory of his deeds will live for ever.   “ T have heard also of its famous mosque, which was lighted with bronze lamps  “ made out of Christian bells ; and of the great addition made to it by Al-mansir,  “which was entirely built with the materials of demolished churches brought  “to Cordova on the heads of Christian captives.   “T have heard it said that the cities of Cordova, Az-zahraé and Az-zéhirah,  “together covered at one time a piece of ground measuring ten miles in length,  “which distance might be traversed at night by the light of lamps, placed close  “one to another.®® I have heard also of its magnificent bridge, and of the  “innumerable mills which the river puts in motion, and which are estimated at  “no less than five thousand. I have heard of its canbdéniyah®® (meadow), and  “of the great fertility with which God Almighty has endowed the earth of its  “districts, and the abundance and good quality of grain and other agricultural  “ productions which it yields every year.   “Every one who has been in Cordova must have heard of the mountains called  “ Jebalu-l-warad (the mountains of the rose), owing to the innumerable rose trees  “that grow on them. Indeed their numbers are so surprising, that although a  “roba (five-and-twenty pounds weight)® of rose leaves will at times fetch at  “Cordova four dirhems, or perhaps more, which makes it a great source of  “revenue to proprietors, yet no one prevents the people from plucking them on  “his grounds.   “The Guadalquivir at Cordova is by no means so fine a stream as it is at  “Seville, yet its waters are sweeter, and there is not so much danger of being   VOL.

The character of the Cordovans is thus described by Ibnu Sa’id. ‘ They are  ‘“‘ very fond of power, and haughty, but at the same time modest ; riches and  “science among them are hereditary, and they exhibit as much zeal in the  “‘ gaining of the former as in the acquirement of the latter. They are generous,  “‘ brave, and kind to their equals or inferiors; but they are the worst people on  “earth to obey, and the most difficult to be governed: indeed their disobedience  ‘“‘to their kings and rulers has become almost proverbial. In proof thereof I  “ shall quote here the words attributed to Sidi Abi Yahya,®! brother of the Sultan  “ Ya’kib Al-manstr. He had been governor of Cordova for some time, and when  “on his return to Africa he was asked to give his opinion on the people of  ‘“* Cordova, he is said to have answered,—‘ They are like the camel, which fails  ‘‘not to complain whether thou diminishest or increasest its load, so that there  “is no knowing what they like, to give it them, nor what they dislike, to avoid  “it. It seems as if God Almighty had created them to be continually engaged  “in war, or in the midst of civil dissensions : indeed in this respect they are worse  ‘“‘ than the people of Irak. They say that I have been removed because I treated  “them with too much severity, and yet they solicit me to return to them, but  “‘ my answer is,—the scalded cat dreads the fire.’ ”’   Cordova was the city, of all the earth, where the greatest number of books was  to be found. Abii-l-fadhl At-tifashi® relates the following anecdote :—‘ I was  “‘ once before Al-manstir Ya’ktb when a dispute arose between the faquih Abi-l-  “‘ walid Ibn Roshd and the Kaid Abi Bekr Ibn Zohr, and the former said, in  ‘* praise of Cordova, ‘ I know not what thou sayest, but what I know is that when  ‘“a learned man dies at Seville, and his heirs wish to sell his library, they  “‘ generally send it to Cordova to be disposed of, and when on the contrary a  “musician dies at Cordova, and his instruments are to be sold, the custom is  “ to send them to Seville.’ ”   But of the cultivation of science in Andalus, and especially in Cordova, as well  as the description of its great mosque, the famous bridge, the royal seat of Medinatu-  z-zahra, and so forth, it is our intention to treat in a separate chapter of this  work (if God Almighty permit us). The cities formerly belonging to the juris-  diction of Cordova were Ezija,* Bolctin,® Ronda, Cabra, Ghafek,® Al-modovar,”  Estepa, Baena, Lucena, Alcozer.®   Another of the great cities of Andalus is Gharnattah (Granada), which some  authors are of opinion ought to be written with a hamza, A’gharnittah,” a word",94,book_1,chapter_2

If that city could  reckon no other honour but that of having been the birth-place of the Wizir  Lisanu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattib, that alone would be sufficient.   The following verses of an Andalusian Ml will show the great estimation in  which this city was held by them.   ‘“« Granada has not its like in the world; neither Cairo, Baghdad, nor  “« Damascus, can compete with it.   “« We can only give an idea of its great value by comparing it to a beautiful  “ bride, of whose dower those countries should form part.” 7°   Lisdnu-d-din, in one of his poetical compositions, where he introduces some  verses in praise of Granada, has the following : :   “« What has Cairo to boast of with her Nile, since Granada has one thousand  ‘* Niles within its Shenil.”   But in order to understand this it is necessary that the reader should know that  the numerical value of the letter shin (which is the first in the word Shenil) is  among the western Arabs one thousand, so that when we say Shenil” it is as if  we said one thousand Niles.   Shenil is not the only river that passes by Granada ; according to Ibnu Malik  Ar-ro’ayni there is another considerable stream called Daroh (Darro), and number-  less brooks ;”? several bridges for the use of the inhabitants are erected over them.   When the traveller Ibnu Battittah” arrived in Andalus on his return from his  long travels, he visited Granada, which .he describes in the following terms.  “Granada is the capital of Andalus and the husband of its cities, its environs  “are a delightful garden, covering a space of forty miles, and have not their  “equal in the world. It is intersected by the well-known river Shenil and  “ other considerable streams, and surrounded on every side by orchards, gardens,  “ groves, palaces, and vineyards. One of the most pleasant spots in its neigh-  “ bourhood is that known by the name of ’Aynu-l-adamar (the fountain of tears) ,”  “which is a spring of cold and limpid water placed in the midst of groves and  “ gardens.”   All authors agree in designating Granada by the name of Sham (that is,  Damascus), although they differ as to the way in which it acquired that name;  some pretending that the district of Elvira, of which Granada was formerly a  dependency, was called so from the Arabs of Damascus having settled in it at  the time of the conquest ; while others refer its origin to the striking similitude  which that city bears to the capital of Syria, in the numberless brooks that wind  through its meadows, and the infinite number of trees with which its territory is  covered. The author of the Minhdju-l-fakar™ (open way to reflection) concurs",95,book_1,chapter_2
"    44 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Boox 1.    in the latter opinion, but the former is the most common; besides, the opinions  of these authors may be easily reconciled, for Ibnu Malik Ar-ro’ayni says that the  people of Damascus were sent thither on account of the similitude the country  around Elvira bore to the place of their birth, and thus both the above-mentioned  circumstances might be pointed out as having led to the origin of its name.   Elvira was an ancient city close to the site now occupied by Granada; this is  sufficiently demonstrated by the words of Ibnu-l-khattib, Ibnu Jazzi-l-kelbi,”* Tbnu  Sa’id, and almost every author who has written on the subject, and who all  unanimously agree in saying that Elvira existed before Granada, and that when  As-sanhaji 7” founded the latter city, built its cassdéba, and surrounded it with walls,  the inhabitants of Elvira removed to Granada. Badis,”* son of As-sanhdji, went on  building and increasing his new capital until it reached the degree of splendour and  magnificence to which it was brought by the Sultans of the Merinite dynasty, in  whose time Granada became the meeting-place of the Moslems, the resort of their  troops and armies, and the strong bulwark of Andalus; for when the Franks  subdued the greater part of Andalus the inhabitants of the conquered cities and  districts all flocked to it as a place of security and protection.   At some distance from Granada to the south-east are the mountains called  Sholayr,”? whose crests are covered with snow all the year round: the snow, adds  Ar-ro’ayni, congeals so hard that it becomes as impenetrable as the rock itself. These  mountains are nevertheless inhabited by a race of stout and hardy people, and the  soil produces the most exquisite fruits, and many exotic plants of India, although  none of its drugs. According to some authors the number of towns and villages  over which Granada extended its jurisdiction was two hundred and seventy.   We shall terminate our account of Granada with the words of Ash-shakandi in  his risdleh (epistle). ‘‘ Granada,” he says, ‘‘ is the Damascus of Andalus, it is  “the delight of the eyes and the place of contemplation of the soul. It has a  “ cassdba with high walls and strong buildings, and a river which intersects its  “‘ markets, streets, and houses, supplies with water its baths and mills inside and  “* outside of the walls, and winds through the gardens and orchards of its meadow.  “‘ God has besides ornamented Granada by making it a sort of watch-tower™ in  “the midst of its extensive plain, where the melted gold of its rivers flows betwixt  “‘ the emeralds of its trees, where the sweet gales of its Nejd*! (or mountainous  “* district) cool and perfume the air. Indeed, what with its luxuriant gardens  “‘ and its majestic cypress trees, the prospect is so fine that both the heart and the  “* eyes are suspended in a kind of silent admiration, and the soul is wrapped up  ‘in the contemplation of its manifold beauties. The soil is so fertile that every  “thing which is required for man’s comfort or delight grows in it. It is not",96,book_1,chapter_2

Or  “if not, can any thing more ingenious or witty be imagined than the answer Hafsah  “gave to the Wizir and Poet Abu Ja’far, son of the Kéid Abi Merwén Ibn  “ Sa’id, when, after separating at Maumal, where they had met and passed the night,  “ he asked her to describe in verse the garden, the brooks, the cypresses, the sweet-  “ smelling gale, and all the beauties of that enchanting spot.  “God has given us a placid and beautiful night; we have seen the  ‘ cypresses of Maumal  ‘Inclining their heads before the mountain breeze, the sweet-perfumed  ‘ gales that smell of gillyflower,  ‘The dove singing her love on the branches of the dauh, and the sweet  ‘ basil inclining its boughs to the limpid brook.’   “ A few days after their separation Abii Merwdn addressed to her some verses on  “ the same subject, knowing that she would answer him; when she wrote to him  “these three verses, which are really invaluable.   ‘By thy life (thou sayest) that the garden has been rejoiced with our  ‘arrival ; I say, on the contrary, that it has only shown us hatred and ill-  ‘ will.   ‘The brook has not murmured with pleasure at our approach ; the dove  ‘ sung only to the object of her love. _   ‘ Heaven did not diminish the number of its stars, that we might observe it  ‘ more freely.’ ”   Among the districts appertaining to Granada, the following deserve more par-  ticular mention. Ist. That of Loshah (Loxa), whence the Wizir Lisdnu-d-din  draws his origin, and which extends a considerable distance through the country,  comprising many towns, villages, and castles. The capital Loxa®™ stands on a  charming spot on the banks of the river of Granada (the Shenil), and in the  midst of groves, and brooks of limpid water. The distance from Loxa to Granada  is one day’s march. 2nd. Beghah, commonly called Beighah, and the patronymic  formed from which is Beyghy.

That of Wadi-ash (Guadix), which others call Wddiu-l-eshit,®  and the capital of which is the city of that name, (Guadix,) a very fine city sur-  rounded by orchards and brooks. The inhabitants are endowed with the gift of  poetry, and great love for the sciences ; the poet Abt-l-hasan Ibn Nasr,” describing  this city, gives the following verses in praise of its river.  “ O Wadiu-l-eshit! my soul falls into ecstasies whenever I think of the  “ favours the Almighty has lavished upon thee.  “ By God, thy shade at noon, when the rays of the sun are the hottest, is so  “ fresh that those who walk on thy banks cannot stop to converse together.  “ The sun itself, seeking a remedy to its own ardour, directs its course  “ through thy shadowy bed.  “ Thy current smiles through the prismatic bubbles of the waters like the  “ skin of a variegated snake.  “ The trees that hang over thy soft inclined banks are so many steps to  “« descend to thy bed, while their boughs covered with blossom, and devoured  “ by burning thirst, are perpetually drinking of thy waters.” °   But this enchanting river is not the only gift which God has lavished upon that  privileged land. The district of Guadix is besides famous for its pure and wholesome  air, its sweet waters, the delicacy of its fruits and vegetables, the richness of its  mines, and the great profusion of medicinal plants that grow in its soil.” It  extends its jurisdiction over many towns and castles; among the latter is Hisn-  Jalidnah,® a fortress which is almost as large as a city, and whence the celebrated  apples called Al-jalidnt take their name. Hisn-Jalidnah is twelve miles distant from  Guadix. Another of the peculiarities of this district is that it contains one of the  two chesnut trees that are famous all over Andalus for their size, and are described  by several authors, and among others by Ibnu Jazzi-l-kelbi, the editor of the  Travels of Ibnu Battittah,®? whose words are as follow :—‘‘ Among the wonders of  “ Andalus, one is the two chesnut trees, in the trunk of which a weaver may sit  “‘ weaving ; this is a known fact.” One of these prodigious trees is to be seen  on a mountain in the neighbourhood of Guadix, the other is in the Al-busherah™  (Alpuxarra) of Granada.   Al-munékab® (Almufecar) is a sea-port belonging also to the government of  Granada. It was there that “Abdu-r-rahman Ad-dakhel first landed when he came  from Africa to conquer Andalus.   Another of the great cities belonging to the central division was Toleytalah,  (Toledo), which at the beginning of the 6th century of the Hijra became the  capital of a kingdom founded by the Beni Dhi-l-ntin,” one of the petty dynasties",98,book_1,chapter_2
"    CHAP. I1.] . DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 47    which sprung out of the ruins of the Cordovan Khalifate. Kaysar (Cesar), who is  said to have founded Toledo, called it in his language Zaleytah,9* which means in  Arabic ‘‘ thou art content ;” but in the course of time the name was corrupted by  the Arabs, who changed it into Toleytalah (Toledo).   During the reign of Beni Umeyyah all the territories subject to Toledo were desig-  nated under the generic name of Al-thagheru-l-addnt, or lower frontier, to distinguish  it from Saragossa and its districts, which were called Al-thagheru-l-a’ali, or upper  frontier. Toledo was further known under the name of Medtnatu-I-molik, the city  of the kings, owing to its having been the court of seventy-two kings of various  infidel dynasties. We have said elsewhere that the Goths made it their capital ; it  is also supposed to have been for some time the residence of Suleyman, son of  Datd, (on whom be peace !) as well as of Jesus, son of Mariam, and Dhi-l-karneyn  (Alexander). It was there that Tarik, son of Zeyad, found the table of Suleyman,  which formed part of the treasures which Ishbdn, king of the Romans, and founder  of Ishbiliah, (as we have said elsewhere,) brought from the sack of Jerusalem. The  table was made out of one solid emerald, and when presented by Misa to the Khalif  Al-walid was valued at one hundred thousand gold dinars. It is generally believed  now to be at Rome, but God only knows. This inestimable jewel was not the only  treasure which T4rik found at Toledo; there were among other things one hundred  and seventy royal diadems, set with pearls, rubies, and other precious stones; a  spacious temple all filled with gold and silver vases, which temple is further said to  have been of such dimensions as to have afforded, when its riches were removed,  sufficient room for the Arab cavaliers to exercise in throwing the spear and other  military sports. This latter circumstance indeed would seem almost incredible, had °  it not been related by trustworthy people and eye-witnesses. But God is all-  knowing.   Toledo is built on the banks of the river Tajoh (Tagus), over which there once  stood a magnificent bridge, consisting of only one arch, supported by large stone  piers on both sides of the river. It measured three hundred 6é’as in length, and  eighty in width; but when the Amir Mohammed besieged and took Toledo he  ordered the bridge to be destroyed.   The Amir ’Abbds Ibn Firnds hag alluded to the taking of Toledo and the de-  struction of its bridge in the following verses :   “When morning came Toledo appeared deserted, and (like a bird) in the  “* claws of a falcon.   “Its houses uninhabited, its streets without people, the whole city as  ‘* empty and as silent as a tomb.   “ The wrath of heaven has fallen heavily upon it; even the bridge through",99,book_1,chapter_2

The saffron, of which large quantities are yearly exported in caravans,  is of itself a source of wealth to the inhabitants, as well as the tincture made  with it, and which dyes of a beautiful butter colour.   The two following verses of an Andalusian poet on Toledo deserve to be tran-  scribed here.   “Toledo surpasses in beauty the most extravagant descriptions. She is  ‘indeed the city of pleasures and delight.   “God has lavished upon her all sorts of ornaments ; he has given her her  “walls for a turban, her river for a girdle, and the branches of trees for  ‘* stars,” 10   The cities depending upon Toledo are Wadi-l-hajarah (Guadalaxara), Kal’atu  Rabah'” (Calatrava), and others; but we shall not say at present any more about  Toledo, and will return to it in the course of our narrative when we relate some  of the events that took place within its walls.   The city of Malakah (Malaga) is another of the great capitals comprised in this  division ; we shall describe it in the words of Ash-shakandi, the author to whom  frequent allusion has been already made in the course of this work. ‘ Malaga,”  he says, “unites land and sea prospects, thus partaking of the advantages and  “ productions of both; its environs are so covered with vines and orchards as to  ‘“‘ make it almost impossible for the traveller to discover a piece of ground which  “is not cultivated. Its towers, which I have seen, are like the stars in the sky—  “as numerous, and shining as bright. It is intersected by a river which comes  “ to visit it in two seasons of the year—in winter and in the spring, when, rolling  ‘its precipitous waters through deep ravines and down lofty hills, it empties  “ them into the sea within the very precincts of the city. But what ranks Malaga  “ far above any other country in the world is its figs called Ar-rayt, from Rayah,'”  “ which was the ancient name of the city; I was told that they may be procured  ‘in Baghdad, where they are considered as the greatest delicacy, and as to the  ‘* quantity annually exported by sea both in Moslem and Christian vessels, it is  “so enormous that I shall not venture upon a computation, for fear of falling short",100,book_1,chapter_2
"    CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 49    “of the real number. During my residence in that city I once travelled along  “the sea coast from Sohayl to Tish,’ a distance of three days’ march, and I  “declare I saw nothing else on the road but fig trees, whose branches, loaded  “with fruit, almost touched the ground, so that the little urchins of the villages  “plucked them without the least trouble, besides the great numbers that were  “ scattered on the ground. Those of Tish are reckoned to be the best; it was  “of one of these figs that a Berber said, when he was asked how he liked it,  “thou askest me how I like it, and it has all melted down my throat,’ and, by  “ Allah, the Berber was right, for I never tasted better figs in my life, and  “ besides they are a blessing which God has refused to his country (Africa).   “ Another of the peculiarities of Malaga is the fabric of allowed and forbidden  “liquors, that called ‘Malaga wine’ having become proverbial. An anecdote  “is told of a Khalif, who, being on his death-bed, and on the point of breathing  “his last, was induced (as is the general custom) to ask the favours of God  “before departing from this life. They say that the Khalif, raising his hand,  ‘exclaimed, ‘O Lord! among the many delightful things which thy paradise  “ contains I ask thee for Malaga wine and Seville oil.’   “ Malaga is also famous for its manufactures of silks of all colours and patterns,  “some of which are so rich that a suit made out of them will cost many  “ thousands ; such are the brocades with beautiful drawings, and the names of  “ Khalifs, Amirs, and other wealthy people, woven into them.'*   “ All the coast of Malaga may be compared to a port, so full is it at all times  “ of vessels belonging either to the Moslems or to the Christians.”   Thus far Ash-shakandi; what follows is borrowed from other writers.   Malaga figs are famous all over the world for their sweetness and flavour ;  they are exported as far as India, China, and other remote countries, and are  universally acknowledged to be superior to any growing in other lands. The  poet Abi-l-hejaj Ytisef, son of the Sheikh Al-balawi,'® quoted by Ibnu Sa’id  and other writers, says, speaking of them—   “‘ Malaga indeed bestows life with its figs; but it also causes death by  “ them.  “ During my illness my physician forbade me to eat them ; how little does  “he care for my life!”  Another poet, the Im4m and preacher Abt ’Abdi-l-wahh4b, from Malaga, has said,  “ Hems has no figs equal to those of Malaga, but its oils deserve particular  “ mention.” 1%  Hems is here intended for Seville, a city which was called so owing to a party    of Syrians from Hems (Emesa) having settled in it soon after the conquest.

The compiler of the travels of Ibnu Battittah, who quotes the preceding verses,  attributes the first to the preacher Abi Mohammed ’Abdu-l-wahhab, a native of  Malaga ; the second he gives as the composition of the Kadi Abu ’Abdillah Ibn  *Abdi-l-malik, but God only knows.   The said Ibnu Battittah, or rather the editor of his travels, describes this city  in the following terms: ‘“‘ Malaga,” he says, “is one of the principal cities of  “ Andalus; it has an excellent territory, and abounds in fruits of all sorts; I  “ saw once eight ratl'” of grapes sold in its market for one small dirhem; the  “* celebrated pomegranate named Al-murst, and another kind called Al-yacétt (the  ‘* ruby-coloured), grow on its soil; figs and almonds form a considerable staple  “ of trade, and are exported in great quantities to distant countries in the East  “and West, as also its golden pottery, which is quite wonderful. It has a  “large mosque, jdémi’, very much renowned for its sanctity, with a very fine  “open court, all planted with beautiful orange trees.”   To the west of Malaga lies an extensive district which comprises many towns  and villages, and is known by the name of Sohayl,'°* owing to a certain mountain  there, which is said to be the only spot in Andalus from whence the star Sohayl  (Canopus) is visible. To the east, on the sea shore, is the city of Belesh (Velez),  which very much resembles Malaga in the abundance and good quality of its  fruits ; farther on, on the coast, is Nerjah (Nerja),""""° which Ibnu Sa’id describes as  avery large town, almost resembling a city in size, surrounded by orchards and  gardens, and with a river so pleasant that it tempts the traveller to halt on its  banks. Another fine town depending upon Malaga is that of Al-hamah '  (Alhama), where there are springs of hot water close to the banks of the river.  But let us pass to the description of Almeria.   Al-meriyah (Almeria) is situate at the bottom of a deep valley formed by two  mountains, on one of which stands the famous castle of Kheyran, so well known  by its strength. This castle was built during the Khalifate of ’Abdu-r-rahmén  An-nassir, but was afterwards considerably improved and enlarged by Kheyrdn ""!?  the Sclavonian, a freedman of Al-mansir Ibn Abi ’A’mir, who, having usurped  the royal power, appointed his friends and adherents to the government of the  principal cities, and gave to this Kheyrdn that of Almeria, where, during the  civil war which followed the death of Al-mansiir, he declared himself independent.  The castle was named after him. On the other mountain is built one of the  suburbs, which, together with the city, is enclosed within very strong walls.  Almeria, on the whole, is a very strong place, for besides its fortifications, and  the high towers that surround it on every side, the city is as it were enclosed  within a natural barrier formed by immense primitive rocks, as sharp and naked  as if they had been passed through a sieve.",102,book_1,chapter_2
"    CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 51    All authors agree in saying that the inhabitants of Almeria were at one time  the wealthiest people in all Andalus, and those who carried on the most extensive  trade, owing to which the population is said to have been very considerable, and  the number of public baths and inns to have gmounted to no less than one  thousand, without counting those of its western suburb, called Rabadhu-l-haus  (the suburb of the cistern), which was also amply provided with inns, markets,  public baths, and manufactures of all kinds.   The river, which is the same as at Berja,'! also contributes no little to the  ornament of the city and its environs, for out of the one hundred and twenty  miles which make up the length of its course, the last forty, before reaching the  sea, are through orchards, gardens, and groves, where the singing birds delight  with their harmony the ears of the traveller.   We find in a certain author that one of the gates of Almeria was called  Bébu-l-’okdb (the gate of the eagle), owing toa figure of this bird which stood  on the top of it from times of old, and was beautiful to behold. This, however,  was not the only ancient relic to be found in the city, for it abounded in old  remains of buildings, and all along the coast might be seen wonderful palaces  and other stupendous structures of the ancient kings of the country.

But we cannot leave the description of this city without copying the words  of Ash-shakandi, for although by following this method we may now and then  be guilty of repetition, yet it is evident that our information is considerably  increased by comparing the accounts of different writers. ‘‘ Almeria,” says  Ash-shakandi, ‘is an opulent and magnificent city, whose fame has spread far  “and wide. God has endowed its inhabitants with various gifts, such as a  “temperate climate, and abundance of fruits; they are handsome, well made,  ‘“‘ good natured, very hospitable, very much attached to their friends, and are  ‘“‘ above all things very refined in their manners, and very elegant in their dress.  ‘“Tts coast is the finest in all the Mediterranean, as well as the safest and the  ‘* most frequented.   “In Almeria are found agates of different shades, which the nobles and other  ‘* wealthy people of Morocco put in their bardrid,’"" as also the polished marbles  “called Al-malhikt (Royal). Its river, called Wddi Bejénah,' is one of the  ‘* pleasantest streams in the world, both its banks being planted with orchards,  “‘ gardens, and trees, so that it looks like a half-smiling mouth in the midst  “‘ of two rosy cheeks covered with whiskers ; and certainly the poet was right  “who, describing the territory washed by this river, said,   ‘It is a land where if thou walk the stones are pearls, the dust is musk,  ‘ and the gardens paradises.’ '**   ‘“ Almeria was at one time under the sway of the famous Kd4id Ibn Maymin,'™™  ‘* who made himself so conspicuous by the great naval victories he gained over the  ‘* Christians, and who, scouring the seas in all directions, stopped the navigation  ‘‘ of the infidels, ruined their trade, made an incursion into Romaniah (Italy),  ‘‘ attacked its ports, and filled the hearts of the inhabitants with terror and  ‘consternation. Such was the terror of his name that, quoting the words of  ‘a poet,   ‘If the enemy was awake, he dreaded him,—if asleep, his sharp-edged sword  ‘ played upon his throat.’ 15   “ Almeria was the greatest mart in Andalus; Christians of all nations came  “to its port to buy and sell, and they had factories'* established in it. From  “thence the Christian merchants who came to its port travelled to other parts  “and markets (in the interior of the country), where they loaded their vessels",104,book_1,chapter_2
"    CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 53    “with such goods as they wanted, owing to which, and to its being a very  “ opulent and large city, filled with passengers and merchants, the produce of  “the tithe imposed upon the goods and, paid by the Christian merchants  “amounted to very considerable sums, and exceeded that collected in any  “other sea-port.   “Costly silken robes of the brightest colours are manufactured in Almeria.”  Thus far Ash-shakandi.   Some of the districts surrounding Almeria deserve mention. One of them is  that of Berjah (Berja), where lead is to be found in great abundance. Its capital,  Berja, is situate on a very pretty river called Wédi-’Adhra'” (the river of Adra),  whose banks are covered with trees and flowers. A poet has said very happily,   “When one comes to Berja on the road to Almeria there is no remedy  “ but to stop there and desist from the journey,   “ For indeed its houses and gardens are so many paradises, while the roads  ‘* leading to them are so many hells.” 18   Hisn-Shinsh’™ is a fine town distant one day’s march from Almeria. Its territory  abounds in mulberry trees, by means of which a prodigious quantity of silk-worms  are reared. The river of Tabernash (Tabernas) passes close to this town.   “ Jayyén” ° (Jaen), says Ash-shakandi in his risdleh, ‘is the citadel of Andalus ; Jaen.  “ for no city can be compared with it for abundance of grain, number of valiant  “soldiers, nor for the strength and solidity of its fortifications. Indeed during  “the last civil war and its disastrous campaigns the infidels had more than one  “ opportunity of showing their inability to compete with the Moslems, since as  “many times as they appeared before the walls of that city they were severely  “ repulsed, obliged to raise the siege, and to fly further than the Pleiades,'*' and  “to make themselves as scarce in the surrounding districts as the eggs of the  “ pelican are among the rocks.'*?   “Jaen is not destitute of ulemas and poets. It is the birth-place of many  “ illustrious individuals in all professions, and the sciences are cultivated in it  “ with as great an ardour and enthusiasm as in any part of Andalus. It is generally  “ known by the name of Jayyenu-l-hartr '* (Jaen of the silk), owing to the extensive  “cultivation of mulberry trees for the rearing of silk worms within Jaen and in  “ the environs. ;   “Tt may also be said in praise of Jaen that it extends its jurisdiction over  “ districts like that of Ubedha (Ubeda), where the vines are in such abundance  “that their fruit cannot be sold on account of its excessive plenty, and like  “that of Bayésah (Baeza), which is famous for its saffron which is exported in  “ great quantities by land and water.",105,book_1,chapter_2

IsHBiLtaH (Seville) was one of the finest cities of Andalus. We have stated Seville.  elsewhere (following the words of Ibn An-naththém) that it was founded by  Ishbin, king of the Romans. However, the building of this city is by others  attributed to another king of the Romans whose name was Julius, and who was  the first to take the title or appellation of Kaysar (Cxsar). Which of the two was  its real founder we are unable to determine. They say that when-Cesar came to  Andalus, and saw the spot which is now occupied by Seville, he was very much  struck with the beauty, extent, and apparent fertility of the country all around  him; that he was also very much pleased with the luxuriance and fine vegetation  of the mountainous district (now) called Asharaf (Axarafe), and therefore deter-  mined upon building a city in that spot. Having chosen a convenient situation  on the banks of the Wddi-l-’adhem (Guadalquivir),! he began the building of his  city, which he surrounded with strong stone walls, and in the certre of which he  erected two citadels of wonderful structure, which he named Al-akhdwin (the two  ‘sisters).2 Kaysar, moreover, fixed his residence in his new city, which became thus _  the capital of his kingdom, and was known ever after by the name of Juliah-  Romtyah,> which its founder gave to it, being a compound of his own name  (Julius) and that of his native country (Romah).   Seville, as we have already remarked, became also the capital of Andalus during  the Gothic domination, for the kings of this race used to divide their court between  four principal cities, viz. Seville, Cordova, Carmona, and Toledo; and to reside in  one of these four cities, according to the different seasons of the year.   One of the authors who has described Seville expresses himself in the following  terms :—‘ Seville is built on the banks of the Guadalquivir, also known by the  “name of Wddi Kortubah (the river of Cordova). A very handsome bridge of  “ boats, fastened together by means of iron chains, serves as a communication for",107,book_1,chapter_3
"    oor    56 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book 1.    ** the people living on the two banks of the river.‘ The city itself is fine and well  ‘* built ; the squares are large, and the market-places commodious and abundantly  “* provided with every necessary,.as also with articles of trade of the most expensive  ‘* kind, which afford great gain to the merchants. The people of Seville are said  ‘* to be wealthy ; their principal traffic consists in their oils, which they ship to  ‘« distant parts of the East and West. The olive tree grows very luxuriantly in all  ‘* the districts dependent on the city, but above all, in that called Axarafe,® which  “ is an extensive tract of land measuring about forty miles in length, and nearly  “as much in width, formed of gentle hills of a reddish earth, and where there are  “* forests of olive and fig trees planted so thickly as to afford the passengers who  “ travel through them a complete shelter in the hottest summer day. The Axarafe  “ contains besides a very large population scattered in farm houses, or living in  “towns and villages, which have also their market-places, their baths,—fine  ‘* buildings, and other conveniences and comforts only to be met with in cities  ‘* of the first order.”   The author of the Minhdju-l-fakar (open way to reflection) says that Seville  was one of the handsomest cities in the world, and its inhabitants famous for their  indolent habits, and their love of pleasure, which in them was almost proverbial.  They led a most luxurious and dissipated life, which, the author observes, “‘ was  “ chiefly owing to the delightful river that flows through their territory, and which  ‘* has not its equal in the world. It is navigable for large vessels, and is always  ‘ filled with pleasure-boats kept by the inhabitants, and by fishing or trading  “ vessels : in the opinion of some it surpasses in beauty the Euphrates, the Tigris,  “ and the Nile. Its banks are covered with fruit trees, forming a sort of canopy  “ over the river, so that one may sail in it sheltered from the rays of the sun, and  “listening to the charming melody of the singing birds. The journey along its  _ banks is equally pleasant, and one may travel the distance of ten parasangs-  “« (thirty miles) through clusters of buildings and farm houses, high towers and  “ strong castles, forming a continued city. The tide is perceptible in the river of  “ Seville at a distance of seventy-two miles from the sea. It also abounds in fish,  “ of which the daily consumption is almost incredible. The amount of taxes paid  “« by the city of Seville only, during the Khalifate of Al-hakem Ibn Hisham, is stated  “ at one hundred and thirty-five thousand dinars.”   Seville and its territory was also known by the name of Hems (Emesa), as we  have said elsewhere ; for when the lands of Andalus were divided among the Arab  settlers it fell to the lot of the people of Emesa in Syria, whose banner imme-  diately follows that of the people of Damascus in the processions at Medina.   Various are the works of art and splendid buildings described by the authors",108,book_1,chapter_3

III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 57    who have written about Seville ; but the most amazing of all is unquestionably the  tower attached to the great mosque, which was built during the reign of Ya’kib  Al-manstir. As a piece of architecture it is unparalleled in the world. Ibnu Sa’id  mentions also several spots in the vicinity of Seville to which the inhabitants used  to resort for the sake of recreation and indulgence ; one was Tarayanah (Triana) ,°  one of the suburbs attached to the city, the other Kabtdi,’ an island on the  Guadalquivir.   Another of the peculiarities of Seville is that figs and oil will keep for a consider-  able length of time without being spoilt ; the sugar cane grows in its territory ; and  the worm called kermes,® which dyes of a colour superior to the lac of India, is  also found in great abundance on the oak trees. But, indeed, were we to enumerate  all the excellences of its soil, we should protract this work to an interminable  length. However, as Seville is one of the cities described by Ash-shakandi in his  risdleh, and this with his usual accuracy and eloquence, we shall here quote his  words :—‘‘ Seville,” says that learned and most accomplished writer, ‘‘is to be  “ praised for many things: mildness of temperature, purity of air, fine buildings,  “ good streets, picturesque environs, and abundance of provisions and commodities  “of all sorts. This latter requisite indeed gave rise to that saying, so common  “among the people of Andalus—‘ If thou seekest for birds’ milk, by Allah thou  “shalt find it in Seville.’ Nor can I pass in silence its beautiful river, the  “Guadalquivir, in which the ebb is felt at a distance of seventy-two miles, and  “which the poet Ibnu Saffar describes in that very ingenious distich—   ‘ The breeze falls playfully on the river, and, lifting up the skirts of its robe,  ‘ agitates the surface of its waters; the stream, resisting the outrage, hastens  ‘ down to revenge it.  ‘The ring-dove laughs on its banks from the excess of his love, and the  ‘ whole scene is covered with the veil of tranquillity and peace.’ ®  _ “But this is neither the time nor the place to explain the phenomenon of   ‘the tide. Both banks of the Guadalquivir are covered with pleasure-gardens,  “orchards, vines, and yew trees,’® in such profusion that I doubt whether there is  “any river in the world to compete with it in this respect; and let this not be  “ taken as an exaggeration, for I once questioned a very intelligent man, who had  “ travelled through Egypt, about the Nile, and he told me that that famous river  “had neither the verdure, nor the orchards, gardens and pleasure-grounds, which  “the Guadalquivir has on its banks. I also asked a traveller who had resided in  “ Baghdad, and he gave me a similar answer about the Tigris: in fact, the  ‘‘ Guadalquivir can only be compared to a paradise, for not only are the districts  “‘ watered by it the most.delightful regions that can be imagined, but the inhabitants   VOL. 1.

The compiler of the travels of Ibnu Battiéttah, who quotes the preceding verses,  attributes the first to the preacher Abi Mohammed ’Abdu-l-wahhab, a native of  Malaga ; the second he gives as the composition of the Kadi Abi ’Abdillah Ibn  *Abdi-l-malik, but God only knows.   The said Ibnu Battittah, or rather the editor of his travels, describes this city  in the following terms: ‘“ Malaga,” he says, ‘is one of the principal cities of  “ Andalus; it has an excellent territory, and abounds in fruits of all sorts; I  “saw once eight ratl'’ of grapes sold in its market for one small dirhem; the  “celebrated pomegranate named Al-murst, and another kind called Al-yacétt (the  “‘ ruby-coloured), grow on its soil; figs and almonds form a considerable staple  “of trade, and are exported in great quantities to distant countries in the East  “and West, as also its golden pottery, which is quite wonderful. It has a  “large mosque, jdémi’, very much renowned for its sanctity, with a very fine  * open court, all planted with beautiful orange trees.”   To the west of Malaga lies an extensive district which comprises many towns  and villages, and is known by the name of Sohayl,'® owing to a certain mountain  there, which is said to be the only spot in Andalus from whence the star Sohayl  (Canopus) is visible. To the east, on the sea shore, is the city of Belesh'® (Velez),  which very much resembles Malaga in the abundance and good quality of its  fruits ; farther on, on the coast, is Nerjah (Nerja),''!° which Ibnu Sa’id describes as  avery large town, almost resembling a city in size, surrounded by orchards and  gardens, and with a river so pleasant that it tempts the traveller to halt on its  banks. Another fine town depending upon Malaga is that of Al-hamah '  (Alhama), where there are springs of hot water close to the banks of the river.  But let us pass to the description of Almeria.   Al-meriyah (Almeria) is situate at the bottom of a deep valley formed by two  mountains, on one of which stands the famous castle of Kheyran, so well known  by its strength. This castle was built during the Khalifate of ’Abdu-r-rahman  An-nassir, but was afterwards considerably improved and enlarged by Kheyran '!?  the Sclavonian, a freedman of Al-mansir Ibn Abi ’A’mir, who, having usurped  the royal power, appointed his friends and adherents to the government of the  principal cities, and gave to this Kheyrdn that of Almeria, where, during the  civil war which followed the death of Al-manstr, he declared himself independent.  The castle was named after him. On the other mountain is built one of the  suburbs, which, together with the city, is enclosed within very strong walls.  Almeria, on the whole, is a very strong place, for besides its fortifications, and  the high towers that surround it on every side, the city is as it were enclosed  within a natural barrier formed by immense primitive rocks, as sharp and naked  as if they had been passed through a sieve.",110,book_1,chapter_3
"    cHaP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 51    All authors agree in saying that the inhabitants of Almeria were at one time  the wealthiest people in all Andalus, and those who carried on the most extensive  trade, owing to which the population is said to have been very considerable, and  the number of public baths and inns to have amounted to no less than one  thousand, without counting those of its western suburb, called Rabadhu-l-haus  (the suburb of the cistern), which was also amply provided with inns, markets,  public baths, and manufactures of all kinds.   The river, which is the same as at Berja,° also contributes no little to the  ornament of the city and its environs, for out of the one hundred and twenty  miles which make up the length of its course, the last forty, before reaching the  sea, are through orchards, gardens, and groves, where the singing birds delight  with their harmony the ears of the traveller.   We find in a certain author that one of the gates of Almeria was called  Badbu-l-’okdb (the gate of the eagle), owing to a figure of this bird which stood  on the top of it from times of old, and was beautiful to behold. This, however,  was not the only ancient relic to be found in the city, for it abounded in old  remains of buildings, and all along the coast might be seen wonderful palaces  and other stupendous structures of the ancient kings of the country.

It is true that there have been at times in  ‘* Seville governors and Sultans, who, being firmly attached to religion, and the  “ strict observance of its ordinances, have done every thing in their power to check  “ the evil; but all their attempts have been vain, and they have never succeeded  ‘< in eradicating it entirely. The Sevillians are generally believed to be the most  “ frivolous of men, and the most witty and jocose ; they are very much inclined to  “« jesting, but sometimes their satirical propensity leads them to break out into the  ‘* grossest injuries and calumny ; this is indeed so inveterate an evil among them  ‘« that it has become like a gnawing worm, and has contaminated all the classes of  ‘‘ society ; and the, corruption has gone.so far that whoever follows not their  ‘‘ example, and indulges not in all these excesses,—whoever is not a calumniator  ‘* and a slanderer of his neighbours, is sure to be hated by them most cordially.  “ Respecting the Asharaf (Axarafe) of Seville much has been said by various  “‘ authors ; it is thus described by a poet, in a composition which he addressed to  “ the Sultan Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbéd,—  ‘ Seville is a young bride ; her husband is ’Abbdd ;  © Her diadem Asharaf; her necklace the river.’ ""  “‘ This district has already been described by me: I shall only add here that it  ‘* surpasses in beauty and fertility every other spot on the face of the earth; that  “ the oil of its olives is exported as far as Alexandria; that its hamlets and villages  “‘are much superior to those of other countries in the extent and commodi-  ‘‘ ousness, and the fine designs and ornament, of their houses, which, from the  “‘ continual white-washing, look like so many stars in a sky of olive trees. An  ‘* Andalusian, who had visited both Cairo and Baghdad, being once asked whether  “ he thought either of those cities superior to Seville, is said to have answered,  “« after expatiating long in praise of Seville and its Axarafe,—  ‘ Axarafe is a forest without wild beasts; its river a Nile without  ‘ crocodiles.’ '? .  ““T have heard also of the mountains called Jebelu-r-rahmah, (the mountain of  ‘* mercy),'? which are in the neighbourhood of Seville, and where fig trees of the  “* species called Al-mitt{'* (the Gothic), and Ash-sha’rt'® (the hairy), grow in great  “‘ abundance ; and I have been told by people who have travelled into almost every  ‘« quarter of the globe that these two kinds of figs grew nowhere in such perfection  “as at Seville.  ‘* Musical instruments of all sorts may at any time be procured in Seville, where",112,book_1,chapter_3

Many of  “these instruments may, it is true, be found in other cities of Andalus, as also  “ players on them, but nowhere in such numbers as in Seville, where they are manu-  “ factured in great quantities, and then exported to Africa, no instruments being  “ fabricated there but those peculiar to the country, such as the dif,” the akwdl,  “the bard, the Abi Karin, the dabdabah of the blacks, and the hamékt of the  “ Berbers.   “As to their means of conveyance by land and water,'® their cookery, their  “fresh and dried fruits, their vegetables and other productions of their soil, it  “would take us too long to describe them.   “ T have also heard of the magnificence and good design of its buildings; most  “of which, not to say all, are abundantly provided with running waters, and  “‘ spacious courts planted with fruit trees, such as the orange, the lemon, the lime,  “and the citron tree. The sciences and the arts are cultivated with more or less  “ardour, with more or less success; the number of their authors is indeed too  “ considerable to be stated, and their writings too well known to need description ;  “ the list of its poets '® is so long, that were they to divide among themselves the  “whole of the opposite land (Africa) they would hardly be contained in it; they  “ have been at all times amply remunerated by Sulténs and wealthy citizens.”   Such are the words of Ash-shakandi in his risdleh. Let us now pass to the  description of cities dependent upon Seville. .   Al-hijari says that Sherish (Xerez) is the daughter of Seville, and its river  the son of the Guadalquivir; he adds that Xerez is a very fine city, with a large  population, and extensive markets, and that it very much resembles the city of  Sa’d in Upper Egypt. Its inhabitants he describes as people of great imagination  and talent, very elegant in their dress, and in the interior of their houses; re-  markable for their good manners and courtesy, and so sensitive and tender-  hearted that it is not. an uncommon thing among them to see people of either  sex die from the excess of their love.   Xerez is famous for the confection of the mojabénah,” which are a sort of  cake kneaded together with cheese, and fried in good oil. Their celebrity may  be ascribed to the superior quality of the cheese with which they are made. It  is a common saying among the Andalusians, ‘‘ Whoever has resided in Xerez, and  “ not tasted its mojabénah, ought to consider himself altogether unhappy.”    Xerez.",113,book_1,chapter_3
"    Gibraltar.    Tarifa.    Beja.    60 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    Talikah (Italica), a city now in ruins, was formerly the capital of a flourishing  district. There was once found a marble statue of a woman with a boy,”' so admirably  executed that both looked as if they were alive; such perfection human eyes never  beheld, nor was it ever heard of in history; and if we are to believe the accounts  of those who saw it in one of the public baths of the city, where it was afterwards  placed, some Sevillians had been so much struck with its beauty as to become  deeply enamoured of it. A poet, a native of this city, who has alluded to it in a  beautiful distich, says that in his time it was in the baths called Ash-shatarah.”   Another of the districts which acknowledge the jurisdiction of Seville is that of  Jebal-Tarik (Gibraltar), which stands as a lasting testimonial of the conquest of  Andalus by the Moslems. This mountain was called after Tarik, freedman of  Misa Ibn Nosseyr, who was the first Moslem who landed on it; it is also called  Jebalu-l-fatah (the mountain of the entrance or victory). The sea surrounds the  mountain of Gibraltar on almost every side, so as to make it look like a watch-  tower erected in the midst of the sea, and facing Algesiras. A certain Granadian  poet alludes to Gibraltar in the following distich :   ‘‘The mountain of Tarik is like a beacon spreading its rays over the seas,  “ and rising far above the neighbouring mountains :   ‘One would say that its face almost reaches the sky, and that its eyes are  “‘ watching the stars in the celestial tracts.” *   And this is by no means exaggerated, for when travellers approach it, coming  from Ceuta, they see it at a distance shining as bright as a lamp. ‘TI sailed once,”  says Abt-l-hasin Ibn Misa Ibn Sa’id, “ with my father from Ceuta to Gibraltar,  “and had an opportunity of verifying the truth of this assertion. When we came  “‘ near the coast my father told me to look in the direction of Gibraltar ; I did so,  “ and saw the whole mountain shining as if it were on fire.”   Jezirah-Tarif (the island of Tarif) is another dependency of Seville. Tarif, after  whom the island was named, was a Berber and a freedman of Misa. They say that  by his master’s command he invaded Andalus before Térik, and landed at Tarifa  with four hundred men. This happened in the year ninety-one of the Hijra  (a. D. 709-10), but of this more will be said, if God be pleased, in the course of  this work. Tarifa is not, properly speaking, an island, but was so called on account  of one that stands before it in the sea ; the same might be said of Jeziratu-l-khadhra  (Algesiras).   Beja™ is the capital of an extensive district, which, during the dynasty of the  Beni ’Abbad, formed part of the kingdom of Seville. It was famous for its tan-yards  and manufactures of cotton goods. The territory abounds in silver mines, and it has  besides the glory of being the birth-place of Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbad.",114,book_1,chapter_3

But owing to the  seditious character of its inhabitants, who were continually revolting either against  their governors or against the Sultans of Cordova, the city was destroyed during  the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, and never afterwards restored.

On the top of this arch is a tower rising to a",115,book_1,chapter_3

At the  summit of the tower, and in one of the stones of which it is built, is a brazen  sword fixed into it, with this wonderful peculiarity, that whoever seizes the handle  and draws it may extract about three spans of it, but no human efforts have yet  succeeded in drawing it out further; when the handle is let go the sword goes with  great violence into the stone, as if it went into a scabbard.*!   Close to the district of Lisbon is that of Oksonébah (Ossonoba), the capital of  which bears the same name, and is a very fine city, to which many towns, villages,  and castles are subject. Further down towards the coast is the city of Shib  (Silves), which was once the capital of an independent state formed by the Wizir  Abt Bekr Mohammed Ibn ’Omar, known by the surname of Dhi-l-wizdrateyn.  But when the Beni Lamtumnah subdued the greatest part of Andalus, this and  other western districts were joined by them to the government of Seville. Silves  is seven days’ march from Cordova; it has the honour of being the birth-place of  Dhi-l-wizdrateyn Ibn ’Omar,*? (may God show him mercy !) and of the Kaid Abi  Merwén ’Abdu-l-mélik Ibn Bedrén, by others called Ibn Badrin, a literary man of  great repute, and who is known as the author, among other works, ofa commentary  on that famous ode of Ibn ’Abdin* which begins thus :   “« Succeeding generations shall be afflicted at the recollection of his  “ virtues.” 3*   This commentary is too well known to néed a fuller description ; we have found  it in most of the great cities in the East, where it is held in great estimation.  The author, Ibn Badrin, was himself a very good poet.   Silves is likewise the birth-place of the famous grammarian Abii Mohammed  *Abdullah, son of As-sid Al-Bathlidsi.*   The whole of western Andalus was at one time under the dominion of the Beni  *Abbéd, kings of Seville, the most powerful Sultans of the time. The great  revenues they derived from their states enabled them to keep considerable  armies, and to surround their court with learned men and poets, who, encouraged  by their liberality, cultivated the sciences with the greatest ardour, and sung  their praises in eloquent and elaborate compositions. Liblah (Niebla), Jebdrah  (Ebora), Shant-Mariah (Santa Maria), Mertilah (Mertola), Jeztrah Shaltish (the  island of Saltes), Shintarah (Cintra), are among the cities of the West which  once acknowledged the supremacy of the Beni ’Abbaid. The last named city  (Cintra) presents, according to Ibn Alisa’, a very curious phenomenon, which  is, that wheat and barley are generally ripe forty days after having been sown ;  the country produces also a very large kind of melons,** measuring three spans",116,book_1,chapter_3

Speaking of this fruit, Abi ’Abdillah Al-yakdri,7 an author  on whose writings great reliance is placed, states that he was once sitting with  Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbad, king of Seville, when a peasant from Cintra entered  the room, and presented the Sultan with four of those melons, which not only  measured five spans in circumference each, but weighed so much that the man  could hardly carry them in a basket on his head. The Sult4én was very much  surprised to see so fine a fruit, and began to question the peasant, who answered  that those melons did not always grow to so great a size, but that they could  easily be obtained of those dimensions by cutting off all the branches of the plants  but ten, and then supporting the stem by means of props of wood.",117,book_1,chapter_3
"    Saragossa.    64 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book I.    CHAPTER IV.    Eastern district—Saragossa—Valencia—Murcia—Cartagena—Albarracin.    Tue eastern district of Andalus contains also many cities of the first order, such  as Saragossa, Valencia, Murcia, Cartagena, Santa Maria, and others.   Sarakostah (Saragossa) was, according to some authors, built by the first Cesar,  the emperor of Rome, in whose reign begins the era called safar,' which preceded  the nativity of Christ, and by which the Christians compute their years. Sarakostah  means, in the language of the Christians, ‘‘the palace of the Lord,” ? and was so  called on account of the said Cesar having fixed his residence in it while he stayed  in Andalus ; others attribute its foundation to Alexander, but God only knows.   It is generally acknowledged that there was no city in Andalus to which more  cities, towns, hamlets, and castles, were subject, than Saragossa, nor which abounded  more in fruits of all kinds, nor which was more plentifully supplied with provisions  of all sorts, nor which counted at one time a larger number of inhabitants. It. was  surrounded by orchards and gardens for a space of eight miles; and the Andalusian  authors often compared it to the cities of Chaldza for the number of its trees, and  the abundance of its waters. It is by them described as a city of great importance,  extending its jurisdiction over several large provinces and wealthy districts, some of  which, teeming with an industrious and active population, covered a space of forty  miles.   Among the productions of its territory is counted salt, which, according to some  historians, is to be found near the capital, white, pure, and transparent, and such as  cannot be procured any where else in Andalus. We find also recorded by more  than one historian and collector of traditional stories that a very curious pheno-  menon has been observed in the neighbourhood of Saragossa. No scorpion, they  say, will enter the territory of Saragossa of its own accord, and if taken there by  any one, the moment it touches the ground it will lose all its power of action, and  remain motionless: the same phenomenon has been remarked in the East with",118,book_1,chapter_4
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 65    respect to other reptiles, and has been explained by philosophers and naturalists  as the effect of the talismanic influence which some countries are known to  exercise over certain animals ; at least such is the solution given to this curious  circumstance by all the Eastern authors who have treated the subject. One  thing, however, is certain, namely, that all Western writers agree in saying that  no scorpion or snake*® ever entered the territory of Saragossa without dying  immediately, and that the experiment was repeatedly tried of bringing them  from distant lands, but no sooner were they within the precincts of the city than  they died suddenly on the spot. To this wonderful quality of the soil about  Saragossa we may add another very striking peculiarity, which is recorded by  almost every author who has. undertaken the description of that city. They say  that no provision or article of food, however long it may be kept, will ever  mildew or be spoiled ; wheat will kéep for a hundred years, and grapes suspended  to the ceiling for six ; figs, peaches, cherries, apples, and plums, are preserved  in a dry state for several years, while it is not uncommon to see beans and  garbanzos which have been gathered thirty years; wood never rots, and no  article of dress, whether of wool, silk, or cotton, is ever moth-eaten.   We have likewise read somewhere that when Miisa Ibn Nosseyr came to  Saragossa, and tasted the waters of the Jelk,‘ he found them so sweet and  good that he swore he had never drunk any thing better since he came into’  Andalus ; and that having inquired about the name of the well, when he heard  it called Jelk he threw a glance all around him and compared the country to the  ghautah (meadow) of Damascus.   The city of Saragossa became, towards the middle of the fifth century, the  seat of a powerful and extensive empire, founded by Suleyman Ibn Hiid,° one  of the generals who, during the calamitous times of the civil war, proclaimed  the sovereignty of the extinct house of Umeyyah, and declared themselves inde-  pendent in their governments. Several authors who have written the history of  the Beni Hid dynasty describe most minutely a famous palace called Déru-s-sorrir  (the abode of pleasures), built by Al-muktadir Ibn Htid, one of the Sultans of that  family, and in which was a golden hall of exquisite design and admirable work-  manship, decorated in the most magnificent manner. This palace is alluded to  in some verses by the Wizir Dhi-l-wizd4rateyn Ibn ’Abdi-shelb.

"    Valencia.    66 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book I.    Molina, Birtanieh, Barweskah (Bribiesca), and others, are among the districts  over which Saragossa extends its jurisdiction.   Among the great kingdoms of the east of Andalus is that of Valencia, which,  after the overthrow of the Beni Umeyyah dynasty, made one of the independent  states into which the inheritance of the Khalifs was broken up. Valencia, the  capital, is one of the finest cities in Andalus ; it is described by Ibnu Sa’id as a  place of great recreation and entertainment, owing to the purity of the air, the  fertility of the land, which makes its environs look as green and luxuriant as a  garden, and the amiable and cordial disposition of its inhabitants, who are always  disposed to pleasure and mirth. The same author (Ibnu Sa’id) says that Valencia  was known under the name of Medinatu-t-tarab (the city of mirth), and that he  once heard his father say that Merwan Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz,’? who had  been king of that city and had retired to Morocco after the loss of his kingdom,  used to say, in praise of Valencia,   “I may compare Valencia to a beautiful maiden dressed in a green robe  “* of delicate texture ; if I approach her she conceals under her green garments  ‘“‘ her white and transparent bosom.” .   The said author (Ibnu Sa’id) says that the territory of Valencia produces very  fine saffron, as also certain pears called Al-arrozah,® not larger than a grape,  but very delicate in taste, and which have so delightful a smell that one may  tell directly by going into a house if there be any of that fruit in it. He asserts  also, on the authority of various writers, that the atmosphere at Valencia is clearer  and more transparent than in any other part of Andalus, and adds that adjoining  to the city are several pleasant gardens and public walks for the use of the  inhabitants, such as the Risséfah,® and the Munyatu-bn Abt ’A’mir..° The Rissdfah,  especially, is described by him as a most delightful and charming spot, full of trees,  orchards, and brooks, and from which a commanding view of the country may be  obtained ; no other spot in Andalus had that name but the gardens of Cordova  and those of Valencia.   Abi-l-hasan Ibn Harik has said, in his reply to Ibn ’Iy4sh,   “Valencia is a spot of great beauty, and its fame has filled both East  “and West. .   “If they tell thee that when water is wanting it is afflicted by famine and  “* plague, and the whole city becomes the abode of misery and desolation,—  ' “ Tell them that, notwithstanding all that, Valencia is a paradise whose  “ lovely spots are at all times free from war and famine.”   Valencia is also in the number of the cities described by Ash-shakandi in his  risdleh ; we shall therefore transcribe his words. ‘‘ Valencia,” he says, ‘‘ is known",120,book_1,chapter_4

The garden called Ar-risséfeh is one of  ‘the pleasantest spots in the world. Near it is a large lake of limpid and  “transparent water,’ which, they say, reflects the rays of the sun in such a  “manner that the light in Valencia is increased by it: this, indeed, is a fact to  “which all authors who have written upon Valencia bear ample testimony.  “ Among the manufactures of this city that of the nes{j, which is exported to  “all parts of the West, deserves particular mention.   “Valencia is not wanting in sons who have distinguished themselves in arms,  ‘“‘and in the sciences. It has given birth to distinguished theologians, eloquent  “‘ poets, and, above all, to many valiant warriors, who have withstood with courage  “the attacks of the infidels, and won the crown of martyrdom in bloody fields of  “ battle.   “The Valencians are very honest,—they are people of very good morals, and  “strongly attached to religion, which they observe most scrupulously in all its  “ practices ; they are also constant in their affections, social, and very hospitable  “to strangers.”   The illustrious poet Abi Ja’far Ibn Mos’adeh Al-gharnétti has said, in allusion  to Valencia,   “ Valencia is a terrestrial paradise; such it is considered to be by its  “ inhabitants ; there is only one thing to make it disagreeable, and that is  “the musquitoes.”   Another poet has said, alluding to these insects,   “There is one thing in Valencia which annoys me most, and puts me out  “ of humour—   “Which is, that the fleas are continually dancing to the music of the  “ musquitoes.””   We shall close our account of Valencia with the following verses of an excellent  poet, Ibnu-z-zakkék,""? a native of that city :   “‘ When I think of Valencia every other city vanishes from before my eyes.   “The more I think of it, the more I am struck with its incomparable  “* beauties.   “God has given it for a dress its green meadow sprinkled with flowers, of  “ which the sea and the river form the skirts.”   Among the districts surrounding Valencia is that of Shdtibeh'* (Xatiba), a city  whose beauty and fertility have become proverbial, and where writing-paper of  excellent quality is manufactured.

Another is that  of Jeztrah Shukar™* (Alcira), which is also very extensive and well populated ;  then comes Deniah'® (Denia), on the sea shore, an ancient city ; Almansaf  (Almansa), the birth-place of the austere and devout faquih Abi ’Abdillah Al-  manséfi, who is buried at Ceuta, where his tomb is visited, and held in great  veneration; Bartdnah (Partana), a town famous for the battle fought in its  neighbourhood between the Christians and Moslems, in which the former were  completely defeated. To this battle the poet Abii Ishék Ibn Ma’éli At-tarsisi '¢  alludes, in those verses which say—   ‘“‘ The Christians were clad in bright armour, but ye were arrayed in silken   “‘ robes of various colours.   “‘ Partana is the spot where your valour and their cowardice became   “once more manifest.”   Mateytah (Matet) is another town dependent on Valencia; a great many theo-  logians and learned authors derive their patronymic from it. Ondah (Cala-onda),  which has a mountain in the neighbourhood with iron mines. It is important not  to confound this city (Ondah) with another whose name is spelt with a ra, Ronda,  and which belongs to the central division, and has also a castle called Ondah.""”   The other great province of this eastern division is that of Tudmir, which was  also called Misr (Egypt), on account of the similitude it bears to that country, for,  like Egypt, the territory round Tudmir is at certain fixed periods of the year  inundated and fertilized by a river called Wddiu-l-abiadh'® (Guadalaviar). As  soon as the waters withdraw the land is sown, and the crops are gathered, as in  Egypt, before the next inundation. The capital of this province was formerly the  city of Tudmir, but in progress of time it was joined to Murcia, and both cities then  formed one under the latter name. We find that Murcia was also called Al-bostén  (the garden), owing to the great fertility and fine vegetation of the valley in which  it stands. A considerable river (the Segura), after watering the greatest part of  its territory, empties itself into the sea south of Murcia.   “ Murcia,” says Ash-shakandi, “is the court of eastern Andalus ; its inhabitants  “ are famous for strength of body, as also for their obstinacy and disobedience to  ‘their rulers. Its river is the brother of the Guadalquivir, since they both spring  ‘* from the same source in the mountains of Shekvirah (Segura).'!® Its banks toa  ‘* great extent are covered with orchards and gardens, and planted with fine trees ;  “and the pendant boughs, the music of the water-wheels on its banks, the  “charming melody of the singing birds, the sweet perfumes exhaled by the  * flowers, are indeed beauties which baffle all description. Murcia is perhaps the",122,book_1,chapter_4
"    cHaP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 69    “city of Andalus where fruits of all sorts, and odoriferous plants and shrubs,  “ abound most, owing to which, as well as to its mild temperature, to the beautiful  “ landscape around the city, and to the great fertility of the earth, the inhabitants  “are perhaps of all the world the people who enjoy most comforts and luxuries,  “and who show most disposition to gaiety. We can only do justice to Murcia  “ by comparing it to a house from which a young and handsome bride should set  “out (to her husband’s dwelling), arrayed in all her ornaments and finery.   ‘“* As in Malaga and Almeria, there are in Murcia several manufactures of silken  “cloth called al-washiu-thalathdt.” It is likewise famous for the fabric of the  “carpets called tantilf, which are exported to all countries of the East and West ;  “as also a sort of mats, of the brightest colours,’ with which the Murcians cover  “the walls of their houses. Besides the above-mentioned objects, there are in  “Murcia fabrics of several articles of trade which it would take us too long to  ‘“ enumerate.   “Murcia has given birth to many learned theologians, eminent poets, and  “valiant captains.”   The preceding are the words of Ash-shakandi in his risdleh (epistle). We shall   “now borrow from other writers the account of the districts, cities, and towns,  comprised within the limits of the province of Tudmir.   The first in importance after Murcia is Kartajénah (Cartagena), which all authors Cartagena.  agree in representing as a very ancient city, surrounded by a fertile territory, where  whatever is sown grows with such rapidity that it is not uncommon to see in some  of its districts the corn springing up after one day’s rain. It is also said that  Cartagena was in ancient times one of the wonders of the world, owing to its  magnificent buildings, and other stupendous structures, showing the wealth and  power of its former inhabitants. Ruins of these great buildings are to be seen  to this day, with columns, arches, inscriptions, idols, and figures of men and  beasts, in such profusion that they dazzle the eyes of the beholders: the most  important of these gigantic constructions is, following the words of a geographer,  the Ad-dawdmis,” which consists of twenty-four piles of free-stone, all equal in  size, and over which are twenty-four arches, measuring one hundred and thirty  paces from pier to pier, and sixty in width, the elevation being upwards of two  hundred cubits: over these arches, and at a giddy height, the water flows through  perforated stones from one pillar to another, the whole of the structure bemg  raised by dint of mathematical science, and finished with the greatest skill.”   Such is the description which a famous geographer has given of Cartagena, but  in our opinion he is mistaken, for the Cartagena here alluded to is in Africa, and  not in Andalus.

The city of Lércah (Lorca) is another dependency of Murcia; its territory  abounds in mines of lapis-lazuli. Hisn Milah (Mula), Aurtweélah (Orihuela), Lecant  (Alicante), are among the districts which acknowledged Murcia as their capital  during the fifth and sixth centuries of the Hijra, when it formed a powerful state,  sometimes attached to the kingdom of Valencia, and sometimes to that of Almeria,  until it was finally subdued by the Almoravides.*   We have still to mention an extensive territory lying half-way between Valencia  and Saragossa, and which, after the overthrow of the Beni Umeyyah, was erected by  its governor into an independent state, and continued to be such during all the  time of the civil war. It is the district of As-sahlah,* which others call Al-kartdém,  and the capital of which is Shant-Mariah (Santa Maria).

ANpDaLus is surrounded by islands, or countries called islands by the Arabs.  Among the latter is Jeztratu-Kddis (Cadiz), which belongs to the jurisdiction of  Seville, although Ibnu Sa’id places it in the territory of Sherish (Xerez) ; but, well  considered, it comes to the same thing, for Xerez and its district belong also to  Seville.   Cadiz is filled with- the remains of buildings, temples, aqueducts, and other Cadiz.  wonderful constructions of the ancient kings of Andalus. ‘‘ The most remarkable of  “ these monuments,” says Ibnu Ghalib, in his work entitled ‘ Contentment of the  ‘ soul in the contemplation of ancient remains found in Andalus,’ ‘is. undoubtedly the  “tower and idol at Cadiz, which has not its equal in the world, if we except  “another of the same shape and description which stands on a high promontory in  “ Galicia. It is notorious that so long as the idol on the tower at Cadiz stood,  ‘it prevented the winds from blowing across the straits into the Ocean, so that no  “ large vessels could sail from the Mediterranean into the Ocean, or vice versa ;  “but, on the contrary, when it was pulled down in the first years of the reign of  “the Beni ’Abd-al-mimen, the spell was broken, and vessels of all descriptions  ‘began to furrow the sea with impunity.”   This idol, in the opinion of some writers, held some keys in his right hand, but  the contrary has been proved by the author of the Ja’raflyah, as we shall have  further occasion to show. It is also stated, that according to an ancient tradition  the belief prevailed all over Andalus that underneath the idol an immense treasure  lay concealed from times of old: that the tradition existed no doubt can be enter-  tained, since various writers, who saw this idol, agree in saying that when ’Ali  Tbn Misa,’ nephew of the K4id Abi ’Abdillah, who held the charge of Admiral  of the Sea, revolted, and declared himself independent at Cadiz, he caused the",125,book_1,chapter_4

These islands may be seen a great distance off at sea, and in clear summer days,  when the atmosphere is quite pure and free from vapours or mist, they are dis-  covered rising far above the horizon. According to the geographer Ibnu-l-wardi,  there is in each of these islands a tower, one hundred cubits high, on the top of  which is an idol of brass, pointing with his hand towards the sea, as if he meant  “there is no passage beyond those islands.” Ibnu-l-wardi? adds that he could  not remember the name of the king who erected those towers; but we find that  Idrisi attributes them to Iskhander dhi-l-karneyn.   In this sea (Ocean), and further towards the north, are the islands called  As-sa’dddt* (the fortunate), in which there are many cities and towns, and from  whence the Majts, a nation of Christians, came. The nearest of these islands is  that of Birtanniyah (Britain), which is placed in the midst of the Ocean, and.  has no mountains or rivers. The inhabitants drink rain-water, and cultivate  the land.   The island of Shaltis,® which is at the lower end of Andalus, is populated, and  has a city which bears its name. The seas in the neighbourhood abound in fish,  which is salted and sent to Seville, where the consumption is very great.   Shaltis belongs to the district of Liblah (Niebla), which is contiguous to that of  Ondba.   These are the islands of the Ocean; those of the Mediterranean are Algesiras,  Tarifa, Mallorca, Menorca, and Iviza, which we shall presently describe.   Algesiras and Tarifa we have already described elsewhere : they are not, properly  speaking, islands, but are so called owing to their topographical situation. The  same may be said of Shaltis. Further into the sea towards the east are three  islands, called Mayérkah (Mallorca), Menérkah (Menorca), and Yébisah (Iviza) ;  the two former are at a distance of fifty miles one from the other. That of Mallorca,  which is the largest in size, may be traversed in one day from one end to another.  The capital is a fine and populous city, and has a canal in which water flows all the  year round ; but we shall describe this island in the words of Ash-shakandi.   “ The island of Mallorca,” says that elegant writer, ‘‘ is one of the most fertile  ‘“and best cultivated countries that God ever made ; it is also the most abundant  “in provisions of all kinds; for were it by some accident to be deprived of an  ‘‘ intercourse with other lands, it would still produce every article necessary for  “the maintenance or the comfort of its inhabitants. It possesses, besides, many",126,book_1,chapter_5
"    CHAP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 73    ‘‘ other advantages, which we pass in silence for the sake of brevity ; suffice it  ‘* to say that it has a magnificent capital, well populated towns, extensive districts,  “* good lands, and more water than it requires for the irrigation of its fields; and,  “ lastly, that it has given birth to many eminent ulemas, and illustrious warriors  “‘who have valiantly defended their country from the attacks of the Christians  “‘ who surround it on every side—   “* Like a pack of hungry wolves, intent upon their prey.”   We think it proper to add here some verses which the poet Ibnu-l-labbénah °  wrote in honour of the capital of this island.   “It is the city to which the ring-dove has lent the prismatic colours of his  ** collar, and the peacock his beautiful variegated plumage.”   The preceding verses are part of a kasstdah which the said Ibnu-l-labbénah  addressed to the king who reigned at that time over the island, and who, it  appears, did much good to the country, and built more than Iskhander himself  ever did.   Next to Mallorca, towards the east, is the island of Menorca, which the author Menorca.  of the Ja’raftyah describes as very small but very fertile, and abounding in grain  and fruits of all sorts, especially grapes. He also says that meat in this island  is particularly good and well-flavoured, and better than any where else; so much  so, that beef, when roasted, will melt as if it were grease, and turn into oil. Sheep  abound in the island, but they are of a very small breed.   West of Menorca and Mallorca is another island smaller than either, called tviza.  Yébisah? (Iviza). It may be about thirty parasangs in length, and nearly as much  in breadth ; it supplies great part of Africa proper® with wood and salt. The island  is well peopled, and the inhabitants are very industrious ; the land produces all  sorts of grain and fruits, but sheep do not thrive; they have goats, and feed  upon their flesh. Raisins, almonds, and figs are among the articles which the  inhabitants grow and export to the neighbouring island of Mallorca. Olive  trees do not grow in the island; indeed the inhabitants do not know them,  and they receive their oil from Andalus.   Besides the above-mentioned islands, there are in this sea (the Mediterranean)  many more, such as Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Malta, but, as they never belonged  to Andalus, although in the possession of Moslems, we shall abstain from the  description of them for brevity’s sake; for, indeed, were we to relate all the  remarkable things contained in these islands, the wonders of the two seas that  surround Andalus, we should neglect the principal object of this our work ;  in fact, we might as well consecrate a whole volume to the description of  them.

"    74 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    We shall now say a few words about those cities in Andalus which fell early  into the hands of the Christians, and where Islamism was rooted up by the  obdurate infidels who attribute partners to God. Alas! at the moment we  write this the whole of that delightful and highly-gifted country, where the  unfurled banners of Islamism waved triumphantly for so many ages, where the  sweeping tide of Isl4m incessantly rolled its mighty waves over the shores of  polytheism, and where the unity of the Almighty God and the mission of his  holy Prophet were unanimously and daily proclaimed from the tops of countless  minarets, is now in the possession of the cruel enemies of God; the heroes who  so long withstood the attacks of both Franks and Goths are no more ; the virtuous  ulemas who instructed the people in the duties of religion, and who opposed their  breasts to the impetuous torrents of idolatry, are either scattered over the world,  or enjoying in paradise the recompense due to their virtues; the temples once  consecrated to Divinity are now places of scandal and impiety, and not one  Moslem remains in the vast precincts of Andalus to praise the true God, and to  bless by his presence the spots that were once the abode of piety and science.  God is great! God is great! There is no strength or power but in God!    The country of | Barshelénah® (Barcelona), on the eastern coast of Andalus, is situate in a sort    the Infidels.    of valley formed by the Jebalu-I-bort (the Pyrenees), which separate Andalus  from the country of the Franks. Barcelona is close to the sea, and has a harbour,  but it is a bad one, and vessels cannot go into it except with a pilot. Barcelona  is a middle-sized city, being neither large nor small; it was several times taken  by the Christians, and retaken from them, during the first centuries after the  conquest, till at last it was ultimately subdued by the infidels’® in the year 383  of the Hijra (a. p. 993-4), and has since remained in their hands, constituting  one of their greatest kingdoms.   On the opposite side of Andalus, that is to the west, inclining a little towards  the north, is the country of Jalikiyah (Galicia), the capital of which is the city  of Shant-Yakoh (Santiago). The author of the geographical work entitled Kitdbu-  l’ajdyib""' (the book of wonders) says that there was in this city a very large  church, held in great veneration by the Christians, who considered and worshipped  it as the Moslems do Jerusalem. ‘‘ Christians,” he adds, ‘“‘ from Constantinople,  ‘“« France, and other infidel countries, came every year to this city, and visited  “its church, not because of its being the seat of a patriarch, but because they  “pretend that the church was built by one of the Apostles of Jesus, son of  ‘“* Mariam, whose name was Yakoh, others say Yacéb; the church which he built  “* was called Shant-Yakoh, that is, the church of Yago, for Shant, in the language  “of the Christians, means a temple, a place of worship, and is an equivalent",128,book_1,chapter_5
"    cHapP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 75    “of our word mesjid (mosque). Every Christian who comes to this city, and  “ visits its temple, is held in great respect by his countrymen, his authority  “increases, and he calls himself hAdj{ (pilgrim). The church is built in, the  “midst of an island formed by an arm of the sea, and has only one door.”   The same author says that there is in Galicia a lake called Al-buheyratu-  l-meytat ? (the dead lake), and that that name has its origin in a very wonderful  peculiarity of its waters, for no human being, animal, fish, or bird, will live in  it, or, if taken thither from other parts of the country, it will die immediately,  with the exception of the peacock, which is known to live, and feed, and lay  its eggs in it. Tbnu Jezz4r, who speaks also of this lake, places it in the heart  of Galicia.   Some other cities, like Liyén (Leon), Samérah (Zamora), Banbilénah (Pamplona), Barbarous ma:  are occasionally mentioned by geographers, but we shall not stop to describe them ; on Andalus.  let whoever wishes to acquire more information on the subject consult the works  of Abi ’Obeyd Al-bekri, Idrisi, and other writers, who have not only described  the cities that were in the hands of the Christians, but given the most ample  and circumstantial account of the manners, customs, and habits of their inhabitants.  However, as it is important that the reader should know who were the nations  of infidels with whom the Andalusian Moslems had to contend for such a length  of time, we shall here transcribe the words of the Kétib Ibrdhim Ibnu-l-kdsim  Al-karawi, known by the surname of Ar-raktk-beladi-l-andalus'* (the slave of  Andalus), who, treating of the barbarous nations who live on the borders of  Andalus, expresses himself in the following terms. ‘‘ The Andalusians are a  “brave and warlike people, and great need have they of these qualities, for they  “are in continual war with the infidel nations that surround them on every side.  “To the west and north they have a nation called Jalalcah (Galicians), whose  “ territories extend from the shores of the Western Ocean all along the Pyrenees.  “The Galicians are brave, strong, handsome, and well made; in general the  ‘ slaves of this nation are very much prized, and one will scarcely meet in Andalus  “with a handsome, well made, and active slave who is not from this country.. As  “no mountains or natural barriers of any kind separate this country from the  “Moslem territories, the people of both nations are in a state of continual war  “on the frontiers.   “To the east the Moslems have another powerful enemy to contend with ; that  ‘is the Franks, a people still more formidable than the Galicians, on account  “of the deadly wars in which they are continually engaged among themselves,  “their great numbers, the extent and fertility of their territory, and their great  “resources.

The Franks are stronger and braver than the Galicians,  “‘ —they are likewise more numerous, and can send larger armies into the field.  “They make war on a certain nation bordering on their territory, and from  ‘‘ whom they dissent in manners and religion; these are the Sclavonians, whose  “land the Franks invade, and, making captives of them, bring them to be sold  “to Andalus, where they are to be found in great numbers. The Franks are in  “the habit of making eunuchs of them, and taking them to castles and other  “places of safety in their territory, or to points of the Moslem frontier, where  ‘the Andalusian merchants come to buy them, to sell them afterwards in other  “‘ countries. However, some of the Moslems who live in those parts (near to  “ the frontiers) have already learnt that art from the Franks, and now exercise it  “‘ quite as well as they do.” *    ee ay a eres",130,book_1,chapter_5

Ruins and ancient remains—The Aqueduct of Tarragona—that of Cadiz—Roman causeways—lIdol of  Cadiz—The pit of Cabra—Iron pot of Kal’atu-Auraéd—Ancient tradition concerning the conquest  of Andalus—Extraordinary olive tree—Water-clocks of Toledo.    Asv ’Osgyp AL-BEKRI says that Andalus contains ruins of buildings erected by  the Greeks, and talismans constructed by their philosophers: he includes in the  number of these the tower of Cadiz, that of Galicia, the amphitheatre of Murbiter  (Murviedro), the water-works of Tarragona, the bridge of the sword, and many other  stupendous buildings scattered all over the country ; and which that author asserts  are for the most part attributed to one of the ancient kings of Andalus, whose name  was Herkiles (Hercules).   Some of these structures are fully described by Ibnu Ghdlib in the historical work Aqueduct at  entitled ‘‘ Contentment of the soul in the contemplation of the ancient remains found Temagone  in Andalus,” as for instance the aqueduct of Tarragona, which he says conveyed the  water from the sea to the city by a gentle level, and in the most admirable order,  and served to put in motion all the mill-stones in the town, the whole being one of  the most solid, magnificent, and best contrived buildings that ever were erected.’   Another wonderful aqueduct was that of Cadiz, which conveyed fresh water Aqueduct  from a spring in the district of the idols? to the island of Cadiz, crossing an arm  of the Ocean. It consisted of a long line of arches, and the way it was done  was this: whenever they came to high ground, or to a mountain, they cut a passage  through it ; when the ground was lower they built a bridge over arches ; if they met  with a porous soil they laid on a bed of gravel for the passage of the water; when  the building reached the sea shore the water was made to pass under ground, and  in this way it reached Cadiz. That part of the aqueduct nearest to the sea Ibnu  Sa’id tells us was still visible at the time he wrote.®   Another of the vestiges of the ancient kings of Andalus were the causeways Roman cause-  which traversed it in all its length. ‘‘ We read,” says Ibnu Ghilib, “in some of the",131,book_1,chapter_5
"    Idol of Cadiz.    78 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    ‘* histories of Rome that when Julius, known by the surname of Heshar (Cesar),  “ began to reign, he ordered the earth to be measured, and roads to be constructed.  “* According to his injunctions causeways were made from Rome to the east, west,  “north, and south of the earth, until they reached half the circumference of the  “‘ globe. One of these causeways led to Andalus, and ended to the east of Cordova,  “near the gate of ’Abdi-l-jabbar. Another, beginning at the gate of Al-kantarah  ‘* (the bridge), south of that city, led to Shakandah, Estijah (Ezija), Karménah  “ (Carmona), Seville, and the sea.* Both these roads were by the orders of  “« Julius provided with mile-stones, on which his own name, that of the city to  “which the road led, and the distance from Rome, were engraved ; they say also  ‘that he ordered that the mile-stones should be furnished with a roof in some  ‘‘ parts of the road, intending them as halting-places for travellers, who might  “shelter themselves from the rays of the sun in summer, and from cold and  “rain in winter ; but that these buildings being in the course of time converted  “into places of corruption and iniquity, and into so many haunts frequented by  “robbers and vagabonds, owing to their situation in the midst of uninhabited  “ districts, and far from towns, the work was discontinued, and the mile-stones  “left in the state in which they are at present.”   The author of the Kitdbu-l-ja’raftyah® has furnished us with details concerning  the tower of Cadiz. We shall quote his own words. ‘In this city,” he says,  (meaning Cadiz) ‘‘ there formerly stood a square tower, upwards of one hundred  “ cubits high, and built of large blocks of stone, admirably placed one on the  “top of another, and fastened together by hooks of brass. On the top of the  “ tower was a square pedestal of white marble, measuring four spans,® and on it a  “ statue representing a human being, so admirably executed in form, proportions,  “and face, that it looked more like a living man than an inanimate block. His  “ face was turned towards the Western Sea; he had his back to the north;?  “‘ the left arm extended, and the fingers closed, with the exception of the fore-  “* finger, which he held in a horizontal position, pointing towards the mouth of  “‘ that sea which issues out of the Ocean, and lies between Tangiers and Tarifa,  “being known by the name of Bahru-z-zokék (the Straits of Gibraltar). His  “right arm was close to the body, as if holding his garments tightly, and in  “the right hand he bore a stick, with which he pointed towards the sea. Some  “authors pretend that what he held were keys, but it is a mis-statement; I  “‘ saw the idol often, and could never discover any thing else but the above-  “ mentioned stick, which he held in his right hand in a vertical position, and  “‘ somewhat raised from the ground; besides, I am assured by the testimony of  “ trustworthy people, who were present or assisted at the pulling down of this",132,book_1,chapter_6
"    CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 79    “idol, that it was a short stick, of about twelve spans in length, having at the  “end some teeth like a curry-comb. Who was the builder of this tower, with  “the idol on the top, does not sufficiently appear. Mes’idi, in his ‘ Golden  “ Meadows,’ ® attributes its construction to Al-jabbdr,® the same who built the  “ seven idols in the country of Zinj, which are one in sight of the other: but  “the most probable opinion seems to be that it was built by some of the ancient  “ kings of Andalus to serve as a guide to navigators, from the fact of the idol  “ having his left arm extended towards the Bahru-z-zok4k (straits), and pointing  “to the mouth, as if he was showing the way. There were not wanting people  “who thought this idol to be made of pure gold; for whenever the rising or  “ setting sun fell on the statue it sent forth rays of light, and shone in the  “ brightest hues, like the collar of a ring-dove, blue being the colour which  “ prevailed. Thus placed on the top of the tower the idol was like a signal for  “ the Moslem navigators to go in and out of the Ocean, and whoever wanted to  “ sail from any port in the Mediterranean to places in Al-maghreb, such as Lisbon,  ‘and others, had only to approach the tower, and then put up the sails, and  “make for the port whither they wished to go, whether Salé, Anfa, or any  “ other in the western coast of Africa. When in after times this idol was pulled  “ down, it ceased of course to be a signal for navigators: its demolition happened  “thus. In the year 540 (a. D. 1145-6), at the beginning of the second civil war,  “ *Ali Tbn Isa Ibn Maymin,""” who was Admiral of the Fleet, revolted at Cadiz, and  “ declared himself independent. Having heard the inhabitants say that the idol on  “« the top of the tower was made of pure gold, his cupidity was raised, and he gave  “ orders for its immediate removal. The statue was accordingly brought down by  “ dint of great exertions, and when on the ground was found to be made of brass,  “ covered only with a thin coat of gold, which, when removed, produced twelve  “ thousand gold dinars. It is a general opinion among Andalusian and African  “Moslems that this idol exercised a sort of spell over the sea, but that the charm  “ ceased the moment it was thrown down. They account for it in the following  “‘manner. There used once to be in the Ocean some large vessels which the  “ Andalusians call kardkir,'? provided with a square sail in front, and another  “behind; they were manned by a nation called Majis, people of great strength,  “ determination, arfd much practice in navigation, and who at their landing on the  “coasts destroyed every thing with fire and sword, and committed unheard-of  “ ravages and cruelties, so that at their appearance the inhabitants fled with their  “ valuables to the mountains, and the whole coast was depopulated. The in-  ‘“ vasions of these barbarians were periodical—they took place every six or seven  “ years ; the number of their vessels was never less than forty, it sometimes",133,book_1,chapter_6

The  ‘tower that I have described was known to them, and, following the direction  ‘‘ pointed at by the idol, they were enabled to make at all times for the mouth  ‘‘ of the straits, and enter the Mediterranean, ravage the coasts of Andalus, and  “the islands close to it, sometimes carrying their depredations as far as the coasts  ‘‘ of Syria. But when the idol was destroyed by the command of ’Ali Ibn Maymin,  ‘“‘as I have already stated, no more was heard of these people, nor were their  ‘* kardkir (vessels) seen in these seas, with the exception of two that were wrecked  “ on the coast, one at Mersu-l-Majis (the port of the Majis),* and the other close  “ to the promontory of Al-aghar.”   Among the wonders of Andalus one is the pit of Kabrah (Cabra), which, in the  opinion of Ar-razi, who mentions it, is one of the gates of the winds. It is to be  seen at some distance from Cabra,'* and whatever efforts have been made to find  the bottom of it have proved ineffectual.   Tbnu Sa’id also mentions a mountain in the neighbourhood of Kal’atu-Aurdd '®  where, says he, is a rock with a wide gap, and within it an iron pot hanging by a  chain. Whoever goes to the spot will see it, his hands will touch it, but all his  attempts to take it out will be fruitless; for no sooner will his hands come in  contact with it than the pot will sink in the cavity of the rock and disappear ;  however, if the person desists from his undertaking it will return to its former  position. This is related by Ibnu Sa’id on the authority of Ibnu Bashkiwal, who,  among some ancient traditions, and other wonderful stories, concerning Andalus,  mentions the following :   “ Tt has been related to us on the authority of a traditionist, who had it from  “ Seyf, that ‘Othman Ibn ’Affan said ‘ that the conquest of Constantiniyeh (Con-  “ stantinople) would be made from Andalus.’ Perhaps he meant Rome instead of  “ Constantinople, but God is all-knowing.”   Such are the words of Ibnu Bashkiwél; but this point requires elucidation.  The tradition to which that illustrious writer alludes stands thus. ’Othmén is said  to have sent an army from Cairwdn to the conquest of Andalus, and to have written  to the generals who were to command the expedition : ‘‘ Know ye how the conquest  “ of Constantinople shall be made, passing first through Andalus; so, if ye quickly  ““ subdue those regions whither ye are bound, ye shall participate of the favours  “of God.” Such is the tradition; but let the responsibility of it lie on its  preservers, for as to us, we wish to be considered entirely pure and free from  it; for although it be true that it has been adopted and repeated by Ibnu Bash-  kiwél, by Ibnu Sa’id, and other respectable writers, yet we cannot give credit to  it, for it is not only improbable, but entirely devoid of foundation. For at what",134,book_1,chapter_6
"    CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 81    time, we ask, did ’Othm4n send troops from Africa to conquer Andalus; when  it is evident, nay, it rests on incontrovertible proofs, that the Arabs never invaded  Andalus until the times of Al-walid, and that Cairwdn, the city from whence  the expedition is said to have departed, was not built until twelve '? years after  the death of that Khalif? However, let not these objections of ours be taken  as uttered in contempt of the authors of the tradition: we merely state them  as a proof of our ardent wish to warn our readers against error, and to assist  them in the investigation of truth.   Another of the wonders of Andalus we would pass over were it not that all  the historians of that country mention it. It is an olive tree, which is said to  blossom and produce fruit on a certain day of the solar year. But this is rather  a proof of the difficult task an historian takes upon himself, and how easily  authors as trustworthy and learned ‘as Ibnu Sa’id may be led into error by the  adoption of facts which they have not ascertained, or by transcribing the accounts  of over-credulous writers. This phenomenon, which Ibnu Sa’id relates on the  authority of people who are said to have witnessed it, is nothing more than  the effects of light on an olive tree of the common species, as the author of  the Ja’raftyah tells us. We shall quote his words: ‘“ In this mountain (meaning  “that of Sholayr, in the neighbourhood of Granada,) is the famous olive tree  “of which people talk wonders. I happened once to pass by it early in the  “morning of the day of Pentecost, when all the inhabitants of those districts  “collect round it. Isaw nothing on it to deserve attention ; both its appearance  “and its fruit were the same as those of similar trees at that season of the year,  “only that, in proportion as the day advanced, the leaves looked of a bright  “green; at noon they looked white, as if the tree was covered with blossom,  “and later in the day, a little before sunset, they partook of a reddish hue.  “ With the exception of this circumstance, which I believe to be common to  “every tree of the same species, I saw nothing wonderful either in the fruit,  “the branches, or the leaves of the tree.”    ol    Extraordinary  Li    ve tree.    Several authors, and amongst them the last-mentioned writer, describe most Water-clocks    minutely two water-clocks which Abi-l-kasim Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman, known by  the surname of Az-zark4l,'® built in Toledo, when he heard of the famous talisman  which is in the city of Arin in India, and which Mes’idi describes as marking  the time with a hand from sunset to sunrise. These clocks consisted of two  basins, which filled with water or emptied according to the increasing or waning  of the moon.

At the  moment when the new moon appeared on the horizon water began to flow into  the basins by means of subterranean pipes, so that there would be at day-break  the fourth of a seventh part, and at the end of the day half,a seventh part, of  the water required to fill the basins. In this proportion the water would  continue to flow until seven days and as many nights of the month were  elapsed, when both basins would be half filled; the same process during the  following seven days and nights would make the two basins quite full, at the  same time that the moon was at its full. However, on the fifteenth night  of the month, when the moon began to wane, the basins would also begin to  lose every day and night half a seventh part of their water, until by the twenty-  first of the month they would be half empty, and when the moon reached her  twenty-ninth night not a drop of water would remain in them; it being worthy  of remark that, should any one go to any of the basins when they were not  filled, and pour water into them with a view to quicken its filling, the basins  would immediately absorb the additional water, and retain no more than the  just quantity ; and, on the contrary, were any one to try, when they were nearly  filled, to extract any or the whole of their water, the moment he raised his  hands from the work the basins would pour out sufficient water to fill the  vacuum in an instant. These clocks were undoubtedly a greater work of science  than the Indian talisman, for this latter is placed in a country under the equinoctial  line, where the days and nights are of the same length, while in Andalus, which  is in the temperate zone, it does not happen thus. They remained for a long  time in Toledo, until that city was taken by the Christians, (may God send  confusion amongst them!) when the tyrant Al-fonsh™® (Alfonso) felt a great  curiosity to know how they were regulated, and caused one of them to be  excavated, which being done the interior machinery was damaged, and the  water ceased to flow into the basins. This happened in the year five hundred  and twenty-eight of the Hijra (a. p. 1133-4).27 Others say that the cause  of their being spoilt was Honeyn the Jew, he who conveyed all the baths  of Andalus to Toledo in one day in the said year of five hundred and twenty-  eight, and who predicted to Alfonso™* that his son would conquer Cordova,  as it happened. This accursed Jew, being anxious to discover the motion of  the clocks, said once to Alfonso, ‘‘O king! were I to look at them in  “the inside, and see how they are made, not only could I restore them to  * their ancient state, but even construct two others still more wonderful, and  “‘which would fill during the day and empty at night.” Alfonso granted",136,book_1,chapter_6

We have also read that the said Sultan and the Africans who formed his court  were very much struck with the beauty of the prospect, the fertility of the land, the  abundance of provisions, the mildness of the temperature, the magnificence of its  buildings, and other advantages which make Andalus superior to any other  country in the world, and that their admiration gave rise to many witty ex-  pressions and curious anecdotes in which the African histories abound ; but  unluckily the work in which we have read these and other particulars is not in our  possession, as we have left it with the remainder of our library in the Al-maghreb  (West), so we must content ourselves with quoting that which we know by heart,  and fill up the deficiency with such works as we have been able to procure in  this country.

This, united to the habits of the Andalusians,  “who, instead of living together, as the Egyptians do, grouped in towns and  “ villages, prefer dwelling in cottages and rural establishments in the midst of  “the fields, by the side of brooks, and on the declivities of mountains, gives  “altogether to the country an aspect of comfort and prosperity which the tra-  “ veller will look for in vain elsewhere; their houses too, which they are  “ continually white-washing inside and out, look exceedingly well by the side of  “the green trees, and, to use the words of the famous Wizir and poet Ibnu-l-  “ himarah* in his description of Andalus—   ‘ Its hamlets brightening among the trees look like so many pearls set in   ‘a bed of emeralds.’   “ And he was right, for if thou goest to Egypt after having staid any length of  “time in Andalus, thou wilt be surprised to see the wretched appearance of the  “ Egyptian villages, placed as they are at great distances one from another, with  “ their narrow, badly constructed, ill-shaped houses, looking gloomy and dismal to  “the eye. In Andalus, on the contrary, the traveller will find many districts  “ where large cities and populous towns almost touch each other, without counting  “the numberless villages, hamlets, farms, castles, and towers which lie between.  “So, for instance, going out of Seville, the first day’s march will take him to  “ Sherish (Xerez), a very handsome city, placed in the midst of a fertile territory,  “and surrounded by villages ; close to Xerez is Algesiras, and then comes Malaga,  “one of the finest ports in the Mediterranean ; and let not the reader suppose that  “this excessive population is only to be met with in that particular district, for  “the description is applicable, as well, to any other province of Andalus, this  “ being the reason why historians and geographers who have described this country  “mention so many large cities and wealthy towns. Most of these are strongly  “ fortified, and surrounded with walls, as a protection against the incursions of the  “enemy ; some, even, will be found so strong by nature, or so well fortified by  “art, as to have been besieged by the Christians during twenty years without  “ falling into their hands. This, indeed, is not so much owing to the strength of  “ their fortifications as to the undaunted courage of their defenders,—their aptitude  “ for all military exercises, to which they are trained from their infancy, and their  “ early and continual acquaintance with the perils and horrors of war, owing to  “the proximity of the enemy with whom they are in perpetual hostility.

May He permit  in his infinite wisdom that the words of Islém resound again in Andalus, and that  its present inhabitants be annihilated and destroyed !   But to return to Ibnu Sa’id’s account. ‘I shall conclude,” says that most  elegant of writers, “ by stating one thing in praise of Andalus which will establish  “its fame much better than any. thing else I can say. When I quitted it I  “travelled along the northern coast of Africa, and visited its great cities, such  “as Marékash (Morocco), Fez, and Ceuta; I afterwards went to Africa proper,  “‘ and the neighbouring districts of the Maghrebu-l-ausatt (middle West), and saw  ‘« Tehdmah, Bejdyeh, and Tiinis ; from thence I proceeded to Egypt, and resided  ‘‘in Alexandria, Cairo, and Fostat; I then went to Syria, and entered Damascus,  ‘* Aleppo, and other intervening cities. Well, I must confess that in the course  “‘ of my rambles I saw no country whatever which could be compared to Andalus  ‘‘ either in beauty, fertility, abundance of water, or luxuriance of trees, with the  “ exception of the environs of Fez in the Maghrebu-l-aksd (remote West), and the  “‘ country round Damascus in Syria. Neither did I see in the East or West any city  ‘‘ which could compete with those of Andalus in the size and solidity of its buildings, |  “for nowhere could I find such magnificent edifices and public works as I saw in  ‘‘ almost every city of Andalus, unless it be some of the works lately raised at  “* Morocco by the Sultans of the dynasty of the Beni ’Abdu-l-mimen, and perhaps  “one or two at Tiinis, where all the houses are built of stone as in Alexandria,  ‘Cowing to the great quantity of ancient stones (dug out from the ruins), only  “that the streets of Tunis are not so well levelled or so broad as those of  “that city. Great buildings may also be found in Alexandria; Aleppo may",140,book_1,chapter_7

To this account of the population of Andalus by Ibnu Sa’id we think it proper  to add what an anonymous writer says on the subject.   ‘* Andalus contains eighty cities of the first order, and upwards of three hundred  ‘of moderate size; as to its towns, villages, hamlets, castles, and towers, their  “number is so considerable that God only can count them. It is stated that the  “towns and villages on the banks of the Guadalquivir only amounted to no less  “ than twelve thousand ; * and Andalus is generally believed to be the only country  “in the world where a traveller meets with three, four, or even more cities in the  “* course of a day’s ride; finding besides at every two parasangs springs of limpid  “ water, and villages with markets and shops well provided with bread, fruit, meat,  “ fish, cheese, and all sorts of provisions.”    The before-mentioned author (Ibnu Sa’id) says in another part of his work that Productions of    Andalus far outstrips every other country in the world in the fertility of the land,  which yields abundant crops of all kinds ; in the delicacy of its fruits, the riches of  its mines, the wonderful productions of nature, and the number of its manufactures.  We shall now proceed to bestow on each of these topics such information as  scattered in the authors that we have consulted.   Andalus has been compared by many authors to a terrestrial paradise ; some even  go so far as to advance that God, having forbidden the Christians the entrance into  the celestial paradise, had given them instead one in this world ; for indeed by what  other name can we designate the countries which the Christians inhabit from the  gulf of Constantinople down to the ocean of Andalus; since they are well known  to be a perpetual paradise, wherein the acorn, the filbert, the nut, the chesnut, and  other fruits of the northern climate, grow at the same time with the banana, the  sugar cane, and others which are the productions of warmer countries alone?  Andalus is the country which has been most favoured by God, and in point  of fruits and other produce of the land even the most fertile regions of India  cannot compete with it. The sugar cane grows in great luxuriance all along its  southern coast, and in more temperate® regions the banana and other delicious  fruits. In general, except dates, which do not thrive, all the fruits of other  climates may be found in abundance, as well as many which are either scarce, or  not produced at all, in other countries, such as the two species of figs called Al-iitt{  and Ash-sha’rl, which grow in the neighbourhood of Seville, as we have stated  elsewhere, and which Ibnu Sa’id says he never saw any where out of Andalus,",141,book_1,chapter_7
"    88 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK I.    nor ever tasted after his departure from that country. The same might be said of  the Malaga fig, or the raisins of Almufiecar, or those called al-’aselt (sweet as  honey), the peaches, the apricots, the pomegranate called Safart,’ the walnuts,  almonds, and several other fruits which grow in great perfection, and which we  shall not stop to enumerate and describe for fear of making this our work too  long.   Another of the productions for which Andalus is famous is its aromatic woods  and roots ; in this respect indeed it has often been compared to India, that privileged  country of drugs and perfumes, which it resembles in some of its productions, as for  instance the mahleb,® that sweetest of all perfumes and choicest of drugs, which is  only to be met with in India and in Andalus, and which, according to Ar-rézi, is  found in great abundance in the western districts. Ibnu Ghalib, quoting the words  of Al-mes’tdi in his Golden Meadows, says that in Andalus are found five-and-  twenty different perfumes or odoriferous substances, such as spikenard, clove,  gillyflower, sandal wood, cinnamon, Kassdbu-dh-dhartrah,? mahleb, and others, and  that out of the five substances which are considered to be the principal ingredients  of perfumes, viz. musk, camphor, aloe wood, saffron, and amber, the two last  are found in great quantities in Andalus. Ar-rézi also, after describing some of  the properties attributed to the mahleb, says that in the district of Dalayah (Dalia),  which falls within the jurisdiction of the Alpuxarras, grows a root called At-tdélaj,!°  which yields not to the Indian aloes in fragrancy ; and which, he adds, grows in  the crevices of rocks, and was collected for the use of Kheyrdn, the Sclavonian king  of Almeria, who liked its smell exceedingly. Kost"" (costum) and spikenard  grow also in great abundance, and the gentian, which is exported to all parts of  the world, is held in great estimation for the sweetness of its smell, and commands  a very high price. Myrrh is found in great quantities in the neighbourhood of  Calatayud ; and various authors speak of a plant with which the mountains near  Ossonoba are covered, and which when burnt sends forth a smell similar to that  of the aloe wood. This account is confirmed by Ibnu Sa’id, who says that there  are in Andalus several mountains covered with odoriferous plants and shrubs, where  if a fire be lighted the air becomes impregnated with a fragrant smell very much  resembling that of burnt aloe wood, and that in the mountain of Sholayr, in that  part which is nearest to Granada, grow many of the plants that are peculiar to India.   Respecting amber, it is found in great abundance all along the western coast of  Andalus,'* especially at Shidhiinah (Sidonia), where it is particularly fine, and  very much prized, owing to its good quality and its resistance when exposed to  the fire. It is known in the East by the name of Al-gharbt (western), and according  to Al-mes’tidi one drachm of it sold in his time for several drachms of that",142,book_1,chapter_7
"    CHAP. VII.] | DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 89    produced in other countries. But let us hear what Al-mes’tidi himself says in his  Golden Meadows. ‘‘ The seas that wash the shores of Andalus, and especially the  ‘“ Mediterranean, abound in amber, which is exported fo Egypt and to other  “countries. That which they use at Cordova comes from a place on the western  “coast called Shantareyn (Santarem), as also from Shidénah (Sidonia). One  “ ounce of this amber is sold in Andalus for three gold mithcals—in Egypt it may be  “procured for twenty gold dinars, although inferior in quality: the ounce used in  “ Andalus is equal in weight to that of Baghdid. As to the pieces of amber which  “ are now and then picked up on the coasts of Egypt, it is probable that they come  “ from the Mediterranean, and are impelled there by the waves. Andalus abounds  “in mines of silver and quicksilver, which have not their equal any where in the  “world, either in the countries subject to the Moslems, or in those which the  “infidels occupy. It produces also ginger root, saffron, and several other aromatic  “ roots, as well as five kinds of musk; aloes and camphor may also be pro-  “cured, although they do not grow in the country, being imported in great  “ quantities from India.”   The preceding has been transcribed from Al-mes’tidi’s work ;“ for although he  adds nothing new to what we have already stated, yet his account is not altogether  devoid of interest. About the formation of amber very little is known; some  authors, like Ibnu Sa’id, believing it to be the saliva and excrements of marine  monsters, while others, like Ibnu-l-hijéri, say that it is a plant growing at the  bottom of the sea.   Mines of gold, silver, and other metals, abound in Andalus; according to the Mines.  author of the Ja’raftyah there are three places from which, during the occupation of  that country by the Moslems, gold was extracted in great quantities ; one was the  river Daroh (Darro), the other a spot on the western coast close to Lisbon and at  the mouth of the Tajoh (Tagus), and a third in the river of Lerida, that which falls  into the Ebro.'® According to Ibnu Sa’id mines of all the seven known metals ®  were to be found in the north and north-west of Andalus, in those countries which  were in the hands of the infidels. ‘ The richest gold mine in all Andalus,” says  that author, ‘‘ is in the neighbourhood of the city of Santiago, the capital of  “Galicia. Silver is also very common ; it may be procured near Tudmir, and in  “the mountains of Al-hamah,!7 near Bejénah, and in the neighbourhood of  “ Kartash,!® a town belonging to the district of Cordova. At Ossonoba’® are  “ mines of tin, a metal very much resembling silver; it is also found in great  “abundance in the country of the Franks and at Liyén (Leon). The Pyrenees  ‘are likewise full of that metal as well as of quicksilver.”   Mines of red and yellow ochre were also very abundant, and in a village close   VOL. 1. N",143,book_1,chapter_7

Tutty was also met with in the mountains near Cordova,  but inferior in quality to that of Paterna. In the neighbourhood of Tortosa were  mines of collyrium, as good as that of Isfahén, and of which large quantities were  annually exported ; quicksilver abounded in the territory of ‘Cordova, lead near  Almeria, copper in the north, as also a kind of metal called as-sofar,"" which very.  much resembles gold ; as to those of alum” and iron, they were so numerous that  it would be a difficult task to mention them all. The foregoing account of the  mineral riches of Andalus has been for the most part extracted from the works of  Ar-razi.   Other writers assert that the primitive inhabitants of Andalus called every one  of the seven known metals after the name of that planet which was known to  exercise an influence over it,—for instance, they called lead, Saturn ; tin, Jupiter ;  iron, Vulcan; gold, the Sun; copper, Venus; ‘silver, the Moon; and quicksilver,  Mercury.   A great variety of precious stones was likewise found in Andalus, according  to the accounts of different writers: for instance, not far from a place called  Hadhratu-l-warikah,® in the jurisdiction of Cordova, as likewise in the mountain  of Shaheyrén,* to the east of Beyra (Vera), are mines of beryl.% Rubies  may be found near the castle of Montemayér,% in the province of Malaga,  only they are very small, which makes them very difficult to be worked. The  golden marcasite, which has not its equal in the world, is extracted from the  mountains of Ubeda,” and is exported to all distant countries on account of  its beauty, as also another stone called Al-ma’tisisd,®* and talc, which are found  in great quantities. Pearls may be fished in the seas adjoining to Barcelona,  but when they are large they are wanting in transparency and colour; as to  the smaller kind, they are found in such abundance all along the coast of the  Mediterranean, that at Vera, a sea-port in the jurisdiction of Almeria, eighty  arrobes® weight are often collected in less than a month’s time.   In the district of Bejénah, not far from a deep valley called Kariatu Ndsherah,®°  there are quarries of a stone resembling the ruby, of various hues, and which stands  the fire. The magnetes (load-stone), which is well known to possess the property  of attracting iron, is found in great abundance in the district of Tudmir, and  close to Lisbon there is a mountain so impregnated with the stone called  An-najddt*! that the whole place looks at night as if it were illuminated with  lanterns.

We cannot pass in silence the spring of Liblah (Niebla), which pours out  glass* of the best quality ; nor a mountain in the neighbourhood of Toledo called  Jebalu-t-tafal, where tafal,* surpassing in quality any other in the East or West,  grows in prodigious quantity.   Andalus is equally rich in marbles, and stones for building. Ar-rdzi says that Marbies.  the mountains of Cordova abound in marbles of all sorts and colours, such as the  purest white without any spot, and that having the colour of wine; the green is  also to be found in the Alpuxarras in large blocks, from which columns are cut;  and in the neighbourhood of Vega, a town depending on Granada, are several  quarries of the most exquisite marbles, such as the spotted, the red, the yellow,’ and  others. Almeria is famous for some small pebbles °’ (agates) which are found in  its territory, and which are exported to distant countries, owing to their similarity  to pearls, which they strongly resemble in brightness and transparency. In short,  Andalus is, in the opinion of historians and geographers, the country which abounds  most in marbles and jaspers, white, black, red, and of all colours.   If from the productions of nature, or the fruits of the soil, we pass to the animal Animals.  kingdom, we shall find that Andalus contains a larger number of the animals useful  to man, while it has fewer wild beasts, than any other country in the world; as a  proof of what we advance we shall quote the words of Al-hijari in his Al-mashab.  “ Andalus,” says that author, ‘‘ abounds in antelopes, deer, zebras, oxen, and other  “quadrupeds common to other countries; but there are neither elephants nor  “ giraffes, lions, tigers, nor other beasts of warmer countries ; instead of these we  “have an animal peculiar to our country which we call al-hib** (lupus), somewhat  “larger than a jackal,®® but equally cruel and ferocious, and which, when insti-  “gated by hunger, attacks and devours men. The mules are strong and sure-  “footed, and the horses powerful and swift, and equally fit for sport and for battle,  “enduring fatigue and weight most admirably, since in time of war they will not  “ only carry a cavalier armed cap-a-pié with all his provisions, but be themselves  ‘ caparisoned and barbed in steel.”   Birds of all sorts, whether small or of prey, are found in such quantities, that  were we to stop to enumerate them we should protract this our narrative to an undue  length ; the same might be said of the fishes, and other monsters of the sea, especially  of the Ocean, where many are to be found so prodigiously large that we are afraid  even to guess at their dimensions lest we should still remain far from the truth.",145,book_1,chapter_7
"    92 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN . [Book I.    Tbnu Sa’id tells us that he once saw one of these monsters, while on a sea voyage,  and that it was so large that the crew of the vessel were trembling lest it should by  a sudden jerk overturn the vessel. ‘We looked at it in amazement,” says Ibnu  Sa’id, ‘‘and were filled with horror and consternation, for a long time unable  “to utter a word, and expecting every moment to be drowned, for whenever  “the monster breathed it raised large columns of water to a height really sur-  “* prising.”   We find likewise in those authors who have written on the natural history of  Andalus that frequent allusion is made to an amphibious quadruped, whose skin is  used as a garment, and whose scrotum is reckoned to be a specific in several  diseases. As the name of this animal is differently written, and there are besides  many extraordinary circumstances attached to it, we shall transcribe here the words  of the different writers who have mentioned it.   Tbnu-l-hijari, in the Al-mashab.—‘‘ The Andalusians make jackets of the skin  “of a certain amphibious quadruped called al-wabrah* (seal), whose skin is very  “‘ much prized ; they are found in great abundance on the shores of the Ocean, and  ‘in that part of Andalus which faces the island of Britannia. Thence they are  “ brought to Saragossa, where the skins are dressed, and then made into jackets.”   Tbnu Ghalib, mentioning these jackets, which he observes were also manufactured  at Cordova, says ‘‘ the skins here alluded to and called samir*! are very much used  “ in Cordova for jackets, but am unable to say to what animal they belong, whether  ‘to some quadruped peculiar to that country, or to the wabrah (seal) ; in case of  “ their being those of the latter animal, it is a well-known amphibious quadruped,  ““ very strong and muscular.”   But the best account is that given by Hamid Ibn Samjiin*? the physician, in his  work on the simples employed as remedies in medicine. It reads thus: “‘ the seal is  “‘a quadruped whose scrotum is used as a remedy in several diseases ; they abound  “in the Mediterranean, where they generally live in the water, although they often  “‘ come on shore, and are pursued by huntsmen, who catch them, and after cutting  “« off their scrotum, let them go. I have heard the people who practise this trade say  “ that if one of these quadrupeds happens to fall a second time into their hands,  ‘* he fails not to throw himself on his back, to show his pursuers that he no longer  ‘« has the object of their wishes, upon which the men let him go unhurt.” *   Another author says that the remedy to which we allude is also called jendu-bd-  dastar, from the animal’s name, which is likewise jendu-bddastar ;“ that it is con-  sidered a great specific in all diseases originating from cold temperaments, on  account of its being held by the physicians and naturalists as hot and dry in  the fourth degree. Some say that in size this quadruped is like a hare, 6thers",146,book_1,chapter_7
"    CHAP. VII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 93    that he is somewhat smaller, and that his flesh has a better taste ; others again make  him much larger,—but God only knows ; one thing is certain, that the skins of the  wabrah (seal), or some other quadruped resembling it, were used as an article  of dress, and much worn by Christians as well as Moslems.   But it is quite time that we should say a few words about the different manufac- Manufactures.  tures that existed in Andalus, which are generally acknowledged to have reached the  utmost degree of perfection, so much so that when an Andalusian begins upon this  subject there is no end to his praises of his native land: we shall here slightly  mention a few; as, for instance, its manufactures of sashes,** which were famous  all over the world for brilliancy of colours and fineness of texture ; its silver and  gold tissues manufactured at Almeria, Malaga, and Murcia, with such perfection  that when taken to Eastern countries the people were amazed and bewildered  at the sight of them. Of the manufactures established at Almeria we have  already spoken elsewhere, when we gave the description of that city; we shall  only add here, by way of supplement, that all the stuffs woven by its industrious  inhabitants were at all times in great demand in the East and West, and that a  very considerable trade was carried on in this, as well as in other products of their  industry, both with Moslems and Christians. At Tentala, a town depending on  Murcia, there were manufactures of carpets called Tental{,“© which, when exported  to the East, brought a very high price. Both Granada and Baza were famous for  the manufacture of certain warm stuffs for winter called Al-mulabbad,”—they were  generally of woollen, stamped,*® and dyed of the most beautiful and delicate colours.  Murcia was likewise famous for the manufacture of coats of mail, breast-plates, and  all sorts of steel armour, inlaid with gold; saddles and horse-harness richly set in  gold; all kinds of instruments of brass and iron, as knives, scissors, and other  trinkets, inlaid with gold, such as are used in weddings to present to the bride; and,  above all, weapons and other warlike instruments, which were so highly finished  and wrought in such perfection as to dazzle with their brightness the eyes of the  beholder.*® All these articles, Tbnu Sa’id informs us, were exported to Africa and  other more distant countries, where they were held in great estimation. Murcia  was likewise renowned for the fabrication of glass and pottery, of both which  materials they made large vases of the most exquisite and elegant shapes; they  manufactured also glazed pottery, and another kind which was washed over with  gold. The manufactures of Malaga have already been described by us under the  head of that city ; it was famous above all things for its glass and pottery, and for  many articles of clothing.   We find also that there were in Andalus several manufactures of al-mafssass,°°  which is known in the East by the name of al-foseyfasd (mosaic), as well as of a sort",147,book_1,chapter_7
"    94 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK 1.    of tile called az-zulaj*! (azulejo), which they used in paving the floors of their  houses. The azulejos were made of all sorts of gay colours, and very much re-  sembled the al-mafssass; they were exported in great quantities to the East, and  used instead of marble flags to make mosaic floors, to pave fountains, and other  similar ornaments.   As to weapons and military stores of all kinds, such as shields, swords, spears,  helmets, breast-plates, bows, arrows, saddles, bits, bridles, and all kinds of horse-  trappings, the manufactures of Andalus exceeded those of any other country in the  world ; and according to Ibnu Sa’id (from whom the preceding narrative is abridged)  that part of the country which was in the hands of the infidels was likewise famous  for the manufacture of arms, so highly polished as to dazzle the eyes; amongst  which he makes particular mention of certain sharp-edged, well-tempered swords,  called al-bordheliat, from Bordhil (Bourdeaux), a city placed at the north-eastern  extremity of Andalus. The same author speaks in the highest terms of the swords  manufactured at Seville, and which, he says, were not inferior to those of India.  Seville is likewise represented by him as a city of great trade, and where several  manufactures of rich clothing and costly articles existed. . The town of Xativa, near  Valencia, was well known for its paper manufactures, of which a large quantity was  annually exported to Maghreb, and to other parts of Africa. But we shall not  dwell any longer on this topic, inasmuch as we have already given some details,  under the head of those cities and districts where the objects were manufactured,  and we may again occasionally allude to them in the course of this our narrative.",148,book_1,chapter_7

Havine thus far sketched some of the peculiarities of Andalus, we shall now Government.  proceed to say a few words on its government and institutions, as well as on the  customs and manners of its inhabitants. Our narrative will be mostly borrowed  from Tbnu Sa’id, an author who has treated the question at large in his Kitdbu-l-  mugh’rab, in a chapter entitled ‘‘ Shining stars in the just and impartial descrip-  tion of the eastern and western governments.”! These are that author’s words :  “ Andalus, which was conquered in the year 92 of the Hijra, continued for many  “years to be a dependency of the Eastern Khalifate, until it was snatched away  “from their hands by one of the surviving members of the family of Umeyyah,  “ who, crossing over from Barbary, subdued the country, and formed therein an  ""independent kingdom, which he transmitted to his posterity. During three  “centuries and a half, Andalus, governed by the princes of this dynasty, reached the  “utmost degree of power and prosperity, until civil war breaking out among its  “ inhabitants, the Moslems, weakened by internal discord, became every where the  “ prey of the artful Christians, and the territory of Islim was considerably reduced,  “so much so that at the present moment the worshippers of the crucified hold  “the greatest part of Andalus in their hands, and their country is divided into  “ various powerful kingdoms, whose rulers assist each other whenever the Moslems  “attack their territories. This brings to my recollection the words of an eastern  ‘‘ geographer who visited Andalus in the fourth century of the Hijra,? and during  “the prosperous times of the Cordovan Khalifate, I mean Ibnu Haukal An-  “nassibi,> who, describing Andalus, speaks in very unfavourable terms of its  “inhabitants. As his words require refutation I shall transcribe here the whole  ‘of the passage. ‘ Andalus,’ he says, ‘is an extensive island, a little less than a  “month’s march in length, and twenty and odd days in width. It abounds in",149,book_1,chapter_8
"    96 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    “    rivers and springs, is covered with trees and plants of every description, and is  “ amply provided with every article which adds to the comforts of life; slaves are  “« very fine, and may be procured for a small price on account of their abundance ;  “ owing, too, to the fertility of the land, which yields all sorts of grain, vegetables,  “and fruit, as well as to the number and goodness of its pastures in which innu-  merable flocks of cattle graze, food is exceedingly abundant and cheap, and the  inhabitants are thereby plunged into indolence and sloth, letting mechanics and  men of the lowest ranks of society overpower them and conduct their affairs.  Owing to this it is really astonishing how the Island of Andalus still remains in  the hands of the Moslems, being, as they are, people of vicious habits and low  inclinations, narrow-minded, and entirely devoid of fortitude, courage, and the  military accomplishments necessary to meet face to face the formidable nations of  Christians who surround them on every side, and by whom they are continually  “ assailed.’ *   “Such are the words of Ibnu Haukal; but, if truth be told, I am at a loss  to guess to whom they are applied. To my countrymen they certainly are  not ; or, if so, it is a horrible calumny, for if any people on the earth are famous  “ for their courage, their noble qualities, and good habits, it is the Moslems of  Andalus ; and indeed their readiness to fight the common enemy, their con-  stancy in upholding the holy tenets of, their religion, and their endurance of  the hardships and privations of war, have become almost proverbial. So, as  far as this goes, Ibnu Haukal is decidedly in error, for as the proverb says,  ‘the tongue of stammering is at times more eloquent than the tongue of  eloquence.’* As to the other imputation, namely, their being devoid of all  sense, wisdom, and talent, either in the field or in administration, would to  God that the author’s judgment were correct, for then the ambition of the  chiefs would not have been raised, and the Moslems would not have turned  against each other’s breasts and dipped in each other’s blood those very  ‘“* weapons which God Almighty put into their hands for the destruction and  “ annihilation of the infidel Christian. But, as it is, we ask—were those Sultans  and Khalifs wanting in prudence and talents who governed this country for  upwards of five hundred years, and who administered its affairs in the midst  of foreign war and civil discord? Were those fearless warriors deficient in  courage and military science who withstood on the frontiers of the Moslem  empire the frightful shock of the innumerable infidel nations who dwell within  and out of Andalus, whose extensive territories cover a surface of three months’  march, and all of whom ran to arms at a moment’s notice to defend the religion  “‘ of the crucified? And if it be true that at the moment I write the Moslems",150,book_1,chapter_8
"    CHAP. VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. , 97    “have been visited by the wrath of heaven, and that the Almighty has sent down  “defeat and shame to their arms, are we to wonder at it at a time when the  “Christians, proud of their success, have carried their arms as far as Syria  “and Mesopotamia, have invaded the districts contiguous to the country which  “is the meeting-place of the Moslems, and the cupola of Islam, committed all  “sorts of ravages and depredations, conquered the city of Haleb (Aleppo) and  “its environs, and done other deeds which are sufficiently declared in the  “histories of the time? No, it is by no means to be wondered at, especially  “when proper attention is paid to the manner in which the Andalusian Moslems  ‘have come to their present state of weakness and degradation. The process  “is this: the Christians will rush down from their mountains, or across the  “plain, and make an incursion into the Moslem territory ; there they will  “ pounce upon a castle and seize it; they will ravage the neighbouring country,  “take the inhabitants captive, and then retire to their country with all the  “plunder they have collected, leaving, nevertheless, strong garrisons in the  “castles and towers captured by them. In the meanwhile the Moslem king  “in whose dominions the inroad has been made, instead of attending to his  “own interests and stopping the disease by applying cauterization, will be  “waging war against his neighbours of the Moslems; and these, instead of  “defending the common cause, the cause of religion and truth,—instead of  “assisting their brother, will confederate and ally to deprive him of whatever  “dominions still remain in his hands. So, from a trifling evil at first, it will  “grow into an irreparable calamity, and the Christians will advance farther  “and farther until they subdue the whole of that country exposed to their  “inroads, where, once established and fortified, they will direct their attacks  “to another part of the Moslem territories, and carry on the same war of havoc  “and destruction. Nothing of this, however, existed at the time when Ibnu  “Haukal visited Andalus; for although we are told by Ibnu Hayydn and  “other writers that the Christians began as early as the reign of ’Abdu-r-  “rahmén III. to grow powerful, and to annoy the Moslems on the frontiers,’  “vet it is evident that until the breaking out of the civil wars, which raged  “with uncommon violence throughout Andalus, the encroachments of the  “barbarians on the extensive and unprotected frontiers of the Moslem empire  “were but of little consequence.   “ But to return to our subject. During the first years after the conquest the  “government of Andalus was vested in the hands of military commanders  “appointed by the Viceroys of Africa, who were themselves named by the  “ Khalifs of Damascus. These governors united in their hands the command   VOL. 1. 0",151,book_1,chapter_8

It was not until the arrival of the Beni Umeyyah in Andalus  “that the fabric of Islim may be said to have rested on a solid foundation.  “When ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Mu’awiyeh had conquered the country, when every  ‘‘ rebel had submitted to him, when all his opponents had sworn allegiance to  “him, and his authority had been universally acknowledged, then his importance  “increased, his ambition spread wider, and both he and his successors displayed  “the greatest magnificence in their court, and about their persons and retinue,  “‘as likewise in the number of officers and great functionaries of the state. At  “first they contented themselves with the title of Beni-I-khaldyif (sons of  “the Khalifs),® but in process of time, when the limits of their empire had  “‘ been considerably extended by their conquests on the opposite land of Africa,  “they took the appellation of Khalifs and Omard-l-mimenin (Princes of the  “ believers). It is generally known that the strength and solidity of their  ‘“‘ empire consisted principally in the policy pursued by these princes, the mag-  “ nificence and splendour with which they surrounded their court, the reverential  “ awe with which they inspired their subjects, the inexorable rigour with which they  “« chastised every aggression on their rights, the impartiality of their judgments,  “ their ‘anxious solicitude in the observance of the civil law, their regard and  “attention to the learned, whose opinions they respected and followed, calling  ‘them to their sittings and admitting them to their councils, and many other  ‘ brilliant qualities; in proof of which frequent anecdotes occur in the works.  ‘of Ibnu Hayydn and other writers; as, for instance, that whenever a judge  “ summoned the Khalif, his son, or any of his most beloved favourites, to appear  “in his presence as a witness in a judicial case, whoever was the individual  “ summoned would attend in person—if the Khalif, out of respect for the law  “—and if a subject, for fear of incurring his master’s displeasure.   “ But when this salutary awe and impartial justice had vanished, the decay  “of their empire began, and it was followed by a complete ruin. I have already  “‘ observed that the princes of that dynasty were formerly styled Omard-bnd-l-  “ kholafé (Amirs, sons of the Khalifs),° but that in latter times they assumed  “the title of Omard-l-mimenin (Princes of the believers). This continued until  “the disastrous times of the civil war, when the surviving members of the  “ royal family hated each other, and when those who had neither the nobility  “nor the qualities required to honour the Khalifate pretended to it and wished",152,book_1,chapter_8

These petty sovereigns, of whom  “some read the khotbah™ for the Khalifs of the house of Merwan—in whose  “hands no power whatsoever remained—while others proclaimed the Abbasside  “ Sultans, and acknowledged their Imam, all began to exercise the powers and  “to use the appendages of royalty, assuming even the titles and names of  “former Khalifs, and imitating in every thing the bearing and splendour of  “the most powerful sovereigns,—a thing which they were enabled to accomplish  “from the great resources of the countries over which they ruled,—for although  ‘“ Andalus was divided into sundry petty kingdoms, yet such was the fertility  “of the land, and the amount of taxes collected from it, that the chief of a  “limited state could at times display at his court a greater magnificence than  “the ruler of extensive dominions. However, the greatest among them did  “not hesitate to assume, as I have already observed, the names and titles of  “the most famous Eastern Khalifs ; for instance, Ibnu Rashik Al-kairwani'? says  “that ’Abbéd Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abbdd took the surname of Al-mu’atadhed,  “and imitated in all things the mode of life and bearing of the Abbasside Khalif  “ Al-mu’atadhed-billah ; * his son, Mohammed Ibn ’Abbad, was styled Al-  “mu’atamed; both reigned in Seville, to which kingdom they in process of  “time added Cordova and other extensive territories in the southern and western  “ parts of Andalus, as will hereafter be shown.   “As long as the dynasty. of Umeyyah occupied the throne of Cordova, the  “successors of ’Abdu-r-rahman contrived to inspire their subjects with love of  “their persons, mixed with reverential awe; this they accomplished by sur-  “rounding their courts with splendour, by displaying the greatest magnificence  “ whenever they appeared in public, and by employing other means which I have  “ already hinted at, and deem it not necessary to repeat: they continued thus until  “the times of the civil war, when, having lost the affections of the people, their  “ subjects began to look with an evil eye at their prodigal expense, and the extra-  “vagant pomp with which they surrounded their persons. Then came the Beni  “ Hamid,’ the descendants of Idris, of the progeny of ’Ali Ibn Abi Talib, who,  “ having snatched the Khalifate from the hands of the Beni Merwan, ruled for some  “ time over the greatest part of Andalus. These princes showed also great osten-  “ tation, and, assuming the same titles that the Abbasside Khalifs had borne, they  “ followed their steps in every thing concerning the arrangement of their courts  “and persons ; for instance, whenever a munshid'® wanted to extemporize some",153,book_1,chapter_8

So when Ibnu Mokéné Al-lishboni  “ (from Lisbon), the poet, appeared in presence of the Hajib of Idris Ibn Yahya  ‘* Al-hamidi, who was proclaimed Khalif at Malaga,’® to recite that kassidah of his  “‘ which is so well known and rhymes in min, when he came to that part which  “runs thus—  ‘ The countenance of Idris, son of Yahya, son of ’Ali, son of Hamid, prince  ‘of the believers, is like a rising sun; it, dazzles the eyes of those who look  ‘at it—  ‘ Let us see it, let us seize the rays of yonder light, for it is the light of the  ‘ master of the worlds ’—'7  “the Sultan himself drew the curtain which concealed him, and said to the  “ poet—‘ Look, then,’ and showed great affability to Ibn Mokénd, and rewarded  “him very handsomely.  ‘* But when, through the civil war, the country was broken up into sundry petty  “* sovereignties, the new monarchs followed quite a different line of politics ; for,  ‘‘ wishing to become popular, they treated their subjects with greater familiarity,  “and had a more frequent intercourse with all classes of society; they often  ‘ reviewed their troops, and visited their provinces ; they invited to their presence  “‘ the doctors and poets, and wished to be held from the beginning of their reign as  ‘the patrons of science and literature: but even this contributed to the depression  “* of the royal authority, which thus became every day less dreaded ; besides, the  “arms of the Moslems being employed during the long civil wars against one  “another, the inhabitants of the different provinces began to look on each other  “‘ with an evil eye ; the ties by which they were united became loose, and a number  “* of independent states were formed, the government of which passed from father to  ‘son, in the same manner as the empire of Cordova had been transmitted to  “‘ the sons and heirs of the Khalifs. Thus separated from each other, the Moslems  “‘ began to consider themselves as members of different nations, and it became  ‘“‘ every day more difficult for them to unite in the common cause; and owing  “ to their divisions, and to their mutual enmity, as well as to the sordid interest and  “ extravagant ambition of some of their kings, the Christians were enabled to attack  “ them in detail, and subdue them one after the other. However, by the arrival of  “the Beni ’Abdu-l-miimen all those little states were again blended into one, and  “ the whole of Andalus acknowledged their sway, and continued for many years to",154,book_1,chapter_8

VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 101    ‘‘be ruled by their successors, until, civil war breaking out again, Ibn Hid,  “surnamed Al-mutawdkel,!® revolted, and finding the people of Andalus ill-dis-  “ posed against the Almohades, and anxious to shake off their yoke, he easily made  “himself master of the country. Ibn Hid, however, followed the policy of his  “ predecessors (the kings of the small states); he even surpassed them in folly and  “ ignorance of the rules of good government, for he used to walk about the streets  “and markets, conversing and laughing with the lowest people, asking them  “ questions, and doing acts unsuitable to his high station, and which no subject  “ever saw a Sultan do before, so much so that it was said, not without foun-  “ dation, that he looked more like a performer of legerdemain than a king. Fools,  “and the ignorant vulgar seemed, it is true, to gaze with astonishment and   “pleasure at this familiarity, but as the poet has said—  ‘ These are things to make the fools laugh, but the consequences of which   ‘ prudent people are taught to fear.’ 9   “‘ These symptoms went on increasing until populous cities and extensive dis-  “tricts became the prey of the Christians, and whole kingdoms were snatched  “from the hands of the Moslems. Another very aggravating circumstance added  “its weight to the general calamity, namely, the facility with which the power  “changed hands. Whoever has read attentively what we have just said® about  “the mode of attaining and using the royal power in Andalus, must be convinced  “ that-nothing was so easy, especially in latter times, as to arrive at it. The process  “is this: whenever a knight is known to surpass his countrymen in courage,  “ generosity, or any of those qualities which make a man dear to the vulgar, the  “people cling to him, follow his party, and soon after proclaim him their king,  “without paying the least regard to his ascendancy, or stopping to consider  “whether he is of royal blood or not. The new king then transmits the state as  “an inheritance to his son or nearest relative, and thus a new dynasty is formed. I  “may, in proof of this, quote a case which has just taken place among us: a  “certain captain” made himself famous by his exploits, and the victories he won  “over the enemy, as likewise by his generous and liberal disposition towards  “the citizens and the army; all of a sudden his friends and partisans resolved  “to raise him to the throne, and regardless of their own safety, as well as that  ‘‘of their families, friends, and clients residing at court, and whose lives were  “by their imprudence put in great jeopardy, they rose in a castle, and pro-  “claimed him king ; and they never ceased toiling, calling people to their ranks,  “and fighting their opponents, until their object was accomplished, and their  “ friend solidly established on his throne.

He was a good soldier, and had been very successful in some ex-  “* peditions against the Christians, whose territories he was continually invading,  “ sallying out at the head of his followers from a castle called Hisn-Arjénah  ‘* (Arjona),”” where he generally resided. Being a shrewd man, and versed in all  “the stratagems of war, he seldom went out on an expedition without returning  ‘* victorious, and laden with plunder, owing to which he amassed great riches, and  “ the number of his partisans and followers was considerably increased. At last,  ‘ being prompted by ambition to aspire to the royal power, he at first caused his  “troops to proclaim him king; then sallying out of his stronghold he got  ‘* possession of Cordova, marched against Seville, took it, and killed its king  ‘* Al-baji.% After this he subdued Jaen, the strongest and most important city  ** in all Andalus, owing to its walls and the position it occupies, conquered likewise  ‘“‘ Malaga, Granada, and their districts, and assumed the title of Amfru-l-moslemin  “* (Prince of the Moslems) ; and at the moment I write he is obeyed all over Andalus,   “ and every one looks to him for advice and protection.” *   The preceding has been transcribed from Ibnu Sa’id’s work, where the subject i is  treated at length: we shall now extract from him and from Ibnu Khaldiin some  particulars concerning the charges or public offices which composed the government  of the different dynasties in Andalus.   The charge of Wizir during the times of the Beni Umeyyah was common to  several functionaries, to whose deliberation and inspection the chief of the state  submitted the affairs of the government. The historian, Ibnu Khaldiin, who in his :  book of the subject and attribute has defined the functions of these and other officers  of the court of the Khalifs, says that the title of Wizir, under the Sultans of  Cordova, was given to certain functionaries in whose hands rested the management  of public affairs, and each of whom had under his care one branch of the admi«  nistration ; for instance, the financial department, the foreign relations, the ad-  ministration of justice and redress of injuries, and, lastly, the care of the frontiers  and the provision and equipment of the troops stationed on them, would each  constitute a separate and independent office under the special care of a Wizir.  These functionaries enjoyed besides the right of sitting in the audience-room with  the Khalif, and it was from among them that he chose his Nayib, called in the East",156,book_1,chapter_8
"    CHAP. VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 103    chief, or grand, Wizir, but who in Andalus was designated by the name of Hajib.  These dignities were moreover conferred on certain noble families, until at last  they became almost like an inheritance ;* so that notwithstanding the governors  and generals, who shared among themselves the dominions of the Khalifs, soon  began to assume the signs of royalty, they still considered the titles of Wizir and  Héjib as a very honourable distinction, and styled themselves Hdjibs of the Beni  Umeyyah, as if they were merely governing their states in their name. Some  even thought that no title could be more honourable, for we see them continually  designated under that appellation either by poets singing their praises, or by  historians relating their actions.   The appellation of Wizir was therefore given to all those who sat in council  with, or were admitted into the privacy of, the sovereign; so that the Wizir,  who to the right of sitting in council united the duties of the administration (in any  particular branch), was distinguished by the title of Dhz-l-wizdrateyn, that is, the  holder of the two offices; and he had therefore to unite to the general accomplish-  ments in literature which were required from the other functionaries a profound  knowledge of the science of government.   The office of Katib or secretary was of two kinds: the most important was called Kitin.  Kitdbatu-r-rasdyil (the office of the correspondence), the chief of which had under  his care the direction of the correspondence of the Sultdn with his allies or enemies,  as likewise the drawing up of orders from the sovereign, and other documents for the  inspection of the subjects : this office was also the most important, and that which  required the greatest abilities in its holder, for he had to write (as it were) in the eyes  and hearts of the people. The second was called Kitdbatu-dh-dhimdm (office of pro-  tection), and corresponded exactly to that of the Kdtibu-l-jihbadheh™ in the East :  the person intrusted with this office had, as its name sufficiently indicates, to attend  to the protection and security of the Christians and Jews ; and it may be said without  exaggeration, that so long as this office subsisted in Andalus and in the Maghreb  no Christian or Jew ever needed the protection and assistance of the great and  powerful. Both these functionaries were called Katibs, a title in which they  gloried, and which they considered as the most honourable which they could  receive; so that whoever wanted to honour or praise them never failed while  addressing them, either verbally or in writing, to call them Katibs ; besides, the  Andalusians showed always the greatest respect for all individuals entitled to that  denomination, and never by any means forgot to do so when they addressed one  of them ; for had any one by mistake or otherwise omitted this, or suppressed any  other of their honorific titles, neither the rank, riches, nor high station of the",157,book_1,chapter_8

No public office whatever equalled that of the Sdhibu-l-ashghdl, or collector of  taxes, in authority and importance, and the person who was at the head of it was  considered more powerful and influential than a Wizir; he had more followers, and  could count a greater number of friends; the emoluments attached to his place  were also more considerable, all necks bowed before him, all hands were stretched  out to him, and he kept the provinces in awe by means of his overseers and in-  formers. Yet with all this, and though this was a most desirable appointment—  one which gave so much influence and importance to its holder, and in which  considerable riches might be amassed in a very short time—it was a dangerous one,  and full of hazards and cares. But this does not belong to our subject, as it  depends upon the changes of fortune, and the character of the Sultan.   The charge of Kadi was always reputed in Andalus as the most honourable of all,  not only on account of his spiritual jurisdiction, all religious affairs being exclusively  intrusted to his care, but also owing to the great independence and power which  that office gave to its holders ; for, as we have observed elsewhere, if a Kaédi sum-  moned the Khalif to his presence, the latter would immediately obey the summons,  —at least such appear to have been the prerogatives annexed to that office during  the reign of the Beni Umeyyah, and such of the sovereigns of the petty dynasties as  followed their system of government. The title of Kadi ought in strictness to be  applied to those only who exercised the functions of judges in a city or large town ;  if the place was small he was called Hékim. The Kédi-l-kodé (or chief Kédf) was  also called Kddiu-l-jamd@’h.   The office of the Sdhibu-sh-shartah ® was the same as it is in our days, and its  functions nearly similar to those now attached to that post in Africa. The vulgar  called him Sdhibu-l-medinah (city magistrate), and Sdhibu-l-leyl (night magistrate).  The functions of this office were at one time of a most formidable description, for  if he were at all in favour with the Sultén, and had his confidence, he could sentence  to death any one he pleased, and have the sentence executed without any previous  leave from the sovereign. However, this appears to have been but of rare oc-  currence ; neither was the appointment much used, being only to be met with in  great capitals, and at the court of the Sultan. Abi Zeyd Ibn Khaldin treats at  length of the functions of this officer,°' which seem to have consisted in the detection  and punishment of crimes against morality—such as adultery, the drinking of in-  toxicating liquors, and so forth. Other civil offences fell also under his jurisdiction.  In former times, however, this office could not exist without the express consent",158,book_1,chapter_8
"    CHAP. VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 105    of the Kadi, by whose sufferance only it continued, and whose authority was much  more respected, at the same time that it stood on more legal grounds.   The office of the Mohtesib®? was generally conferred in Andalus on men of Mohtesib.  probity, experience, and learning, and who belonged to the class of the Kadis.  The duties of this officer consisted in riding, early in the morning, through the  market, followed by his guards, one of whom carried a pair of scales in his hand,  to weigh the bread ; for in Andalus the weight and price of bread was at all times  fixed by the authorities ; so, for instance, a loaf of a certain weight would sell for  the fourth of a dirhem, and another of half its size for the eighth of a dirhem.  These measures, moreover, produced so good an effect, that whoever wanted  provisions for his daily consumption might send to market a little boy or a  simple girl, with directions to buy whatever he wanted, and yet be perfectly  satisfied that no imposition was practised upon him, and that every article had  its proper weight. The sale of meat was likewise subjected to the same rule,  it being enjoined to every butcher to have over his stall a label, with an inscription  marking the price fixed by the authorities of the town. So neither bakers nor  butchers dared to sell their articles for a higher price, nor cheat in the weight ; for  were the Mohtesib to entertain the least suspicion about one of them, he would  soon put him to the test by sending a boy or girl to buy some bread or meat from  him, and if, when weighed, it was found to be in the least deficient, he would  punish the infractor, and fine him heavily ; this for the first time, for if he were to  be found in fault again, the magistrate would sentence him to be publicly flogged,  and exposed in the market-place for the salutary warning of all the rest of the  dealers, after which he would banish him the city. The office of the Mohtesib was  further made to extend to all articles of sale, and those who filled it had to learn  certain practices or rules before being fit to obtain it; in the same manner as a  Faquih would among us study the decisions of the law before he would be con-  sidered fit to fill the situation of a Kédi.*   As to the night-watch, whom we call in the West Tawdfu-I-leyl, and who in the Ad-dirabin, or  East are called As‘hab-arbd’,* they were generally designated in Andalus under the neues  name of Ad-ddrabin (gate-keepers), on account of certain interior gates which most  of the cities in that country had, and which it was the duty of those guards to shut  every evening after the prayer of ’atemah, thereby preventing any communication  between the various quarters of the city during the night. Every one of these  gates had its watchman, who, besides being well armed, was provided with a dark  lantern, and had with him a dog to warn him by his bark if any noise was heard.  “ All these precautions,” adds Ibnu Sa’id, ‘are indispensable in the large cities  “of Andalus, owing to the great number of thieves and vagabonds who either   VOL. 1.

It is therefore a thing of frequent occurrence  ‘in Andalus to hear people say,—‘ Last night robbers broke into the house of such  “a one, or such a one was found murdered in his bed.’”’ It is true, observes our  author, that crimes of this kind are not equally common all over Andalus, and  are generally confined to large cities, and, even there, they are more or less frequent  according to the severity or indifference shown by the authorities; but in general  it must be owned that although the greatest rigour has been at times employed  against robbers, so much as to inflict capital punishment for stealing a bunch of  grapes out of a vineyard, and that the sword of justice has dropped with their  blood, Andalus has never been quite free from that scourge. A very entertaining  anecdote is told of a famous highwayman, called Al-bdziyu-l-ash’ab (the Grey-hawk),  who lived in the time of Al-mu’atamed, King of Seville. He was renowned for his °  dexterity and courage, and soon became the scourge of the country; for at the  head of a small band of chosen followers he began to scour the fields, surprising  the inhabitants in their farms and villages, and depriving them of their valuables.  Long did he baffle the search of justice, and escape from every troop sent for his  apprehension ; but, at last, he fell one day into the hands of the king’s officers, and  the event being reported to Al-mu’atamed, he was sentenced to be crucified by the  side of a much-frequented path, in the midst of the very district which had been the  principal theatre of his depredations. The sentence having been duly carried into  execution, the poor man was hanging miserably stretched on the cross, when, behold !  his wife and daughters came up, and began to sob and wail around him, exclaiming,  in the midst of their tears, “Our doom is signed, and our deaths are certain ; who  “« shall provide for us when thou art no more?” They were thus lamenting over  their misfortune when a peasant happened to pass by, riding on a mule, and having  before him something like a large bundle of clothes or goods.—‘‘ Friend,” said the  robber on the cross to the passenger, “take pity on me, and, since thou seest me  ‘in this condition, grant me a last favour, which will prove beneficial to thee too.”  “ And what is it, pray?” said the peasant. ‘Go to yonder well,” replied the  robber, ‘‘ and thou shalt find at the bottom one hundred dindrs in a purse, which,  “as I was closely pursued by the constables, I threw therein ; if thou succeed in  “‘ getting them out, half shall be thy reward; the remaining half thou must  “ give to my wife and daughters here, that they may support themselves for a",160,book_1,chapter_8

Go, hasten to the spot, and do not be afraid ; my wife will  “« assist thee in thy descent by holding a rope, and my daughters will take care  “‘ of thy mule.” The peasant consented, upon the offered conditions, and bent his  steps towards the well; there he tied a rope round his waist, ‘and, assisted by the  woman, began to let himself down, but no sooner had he reached the bottom than  the robber’s wife cut the rope, and the poor wretch was left in the water struggling  and screaming, while his deceiver, as may easily be imagined, hastened to the spot  where his mule was, seized on whatever property he carried, and quickly dis-  appeared with her daughters. The poor man, in the meanwhile, finding the depth of  the well, and that he had not the means of getting out, began to cry out as loud as  he could, in hopes of calling the attention of some passenger ; and the hollow of the  well rang with his cries of ‘‘help! help!” It was summer time, and the weather  very hot, so that many travellers approached the well to draw water for themselves  and their beasts; but the moment one of them came near to it, and heard the voice  of the poor peasant inside, he ran away from it in great fright and consternation,  not knowing what caused the pitiful lamentations and wailings that issued from the  water. For many a long hour did the unhappy man remain in this miserable  plight, until some of the passengers having acquainted each other with the circum-  stance, they came to the resolution of returning to the spot, and ascertaining the  cause of the strange noises they had heard. Hastening back to the well, they  soon discovered the peasant lying at the bottom of it, who, by means of a rope  thrown him, was speedily extricated from the dangerous situation in which he lay.  Being asked how he had come by his misfortune, he told them that he had been  deceived, and pointing to the highwayman on the cross, ‘‘ Yonder knave,”’ said he,  “* was the cause of it, in order to give his wife and daughters an opportunity to  “ plunder me.” However, the adventure soon became known in Seville, whither the  peasant directed his course, and being reported to A]-mu’atamed, he was surprised  to hear of the robber’s cunning and impudence; and wishing to see him, and  interrogate him on the subject, he commanded that Grey-hawk should be made  to appear in his presence. Agreeably to his orders, the robber was let down from  the cross, and brought before the King, who addressed him thus: ‘‘ Tell me, O  “ Grey-hawk ! how couldst thou be guilty of such a crime as that now imputed to  “thee, and that too, being, as it were, under the clutch of death?” ‘“O King!”  replied the robber, “ if thou knewest how strongly nature impels me to the  ‘* perpetration of such acts, and how great is the pleasure I enjoy while I commit  “them, Ihave no doubt but that thou wouldst relinquish the royal power, and  “‘ embrace my profession.” Al-mu’atamed could not help smiling when he heard  this; he then said, after some time, ‘‘ O Grey-hawk! were I to set thee at liberty,",161,book_1,chapter_8

These appear to have been the principal offices during the reign of the Beni  Umeyyah and those of the petty sovereigns who usurped the power after them;  there are still some civil as well as military appointments which we have  passed in silence for brevity’s sake, such as the Wali, or governor of a  province, the Kdyidu-l-asdtil (admiral of the fleet*), and others. In general,  the Sulténs of the house of Merwdn were distinguished for their care in  naming to these offices the individuals most fit for their several duties, as  also for having vied with each other in distinguishing and honouring the  learned, raising them in rank or command, and admitting them to their  privacy and favour: they were never known to appoint an undeserving Wizir  nor a Kadi, nor to grant a seat in their council-room but to those who  had given ample proofs of sagacity and learning. They always showed the  greatest respect for the opinions of the learned, as is well known in the case  of Al-hakem, who, persuaded by some strict theologians who were averse to  wine, commanded that all the vines in his dominions should be rooted up,  although, on the suggestion of some of his favourites, who represented to him  that he could not prevent wine being made in other countries, and intro-  duced into Andalus, he relaxed in severity, and the order was never carried  into execution.*® They never appointed any to the charge of Mufti, or to the  examination of witnesses, but men of great learning and experience, and well  read in the Koran, and in the decisions of the law. They were also to be rich,  or at least to be possessed of a decent income, lest their poverty should induce  them to covet the property of others, and sell justice to the pleaders. Ash-  shakandi, from whom the foregoing details are borrowed, relates an anecdote  which we shall transcribe here, as illustrative of what we have advanced. ‘“ Al-  “‘hakem, surnamed Ar-rabadht*’ (he of the suburb), wishing once to appoint  “one of the most distinguished theologians of Cordova to the special charge of  “« receiving the declarations of witnesses, consulted with Yahya Ibn Yahya,** ’Abdu-  ‘* |-mdlik,®® and other doctors, upon the propriety of his nomination, and asked  “‘ them to give him their opinion on the person of his choice.

The counsellors then left the room, and  “ Al-hakem remained thoughtful, until his son ’Abdu-r-rahmdén, who succeeded  “him in the empire, happening to come in, and seeing sorrow and anger on his  “countenance, inquired the cause of it. ‘ What ails thee, O father! who has  “displeased thee ?? ‘ Hast thou not seen,’ said Al-hakem, ‘ those whom I  “extolled and raised above all others, and whom I have distinguished so far as  “to consult them on matters which neither concerned them, nor affected them  “in the least, wishing us to turn our faces from our intention, and shutting  “upon us the gates of intercession ?’—and then he told his son what had  “occurred. ‘O, father!’ replied ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, ‘thou art the dispenser of  “ justice, and thy uprightness exceeds that of any other Sultan on the earth ;  “in appointing and distinguishing the men of whom thou now complainest,  “thy object was, no doubt, not to raise and extol them, but to honour science  “through their means; so I see no remedy for it unless thou removest them  “from their situations, and take away their dignities and honours to confer  ‘them on ignorant people.’ ‘ Certainly not,’ said Al-hakem, ‘that I will  “never do.’ ‘ Well, then,’ continued his son, ‘ be just with them, and since  “science and virtue have no other language, leave them im their offices, that  “they may enjoy the pleasures of this world, and afterwards participate in the  “blessings of the other.’ ‘Thou art right, son!’ interrupted Al-hakem. ‘ As  “to the objection raised by them,’ continued ’Abdu-r-rahman, ‘ respecting  “the scantiness of his means, and his liability to be corrupted, the remedy rests  ‘in thy hands, and thou mayest stop their mouths by a single act of thy wonted  “ generosity.’ ‘ And what is that?’ replied Al-hakem. ‘ Give to thy protégé,’  “ answered ’Abdu-r-rahmén, ‘ from thy treasury, a sufficient sum to enable him to  “ fill his station with honour ; this will remove all the scruples of thy advisers,  “and will, besides being an action in which none of thy predecessors surpassed  “thee, raise thee highly in the estimation of thy subjects.’ ‘ Well said,’ ex-  “claimed Al-hakem, his countenance suddenly brightening with joy and satis-",163,book_1,chapter_8

And this was certainly a noble and generous  “ action, the merits of which cannot be concealed, nor its memory be obliterated  “by time. Thus provided with means sufficient to resist the temptations of  “bribery, and having sufficient piety and virtue to avoid the committing of  “acts offensive to God, and the requisite learning to guide him through the  “‘maze of legal decisions, and to inspire him with equitable sentences in all  “ trials and judgments, the new functionary fulfilled his duties in the most steady  “and upright manner, and his legal decisions became so many oracles among  “those of his profession.”   In the first years of the conquest the Moslems of Andalus were subject to  the payment of those legal taxes designated in the Sunnah, and which every  Moslem is bound to contribute. This, joined to certain customs paid by the  Jews and Christians, was more than sufficient to meet the expenses of the court  and carry on the government, but in latter times the splendour assumed by  the Sulténs of the family of Merw4n, their prodigality towards the learned, and  the numerous armies they were obliged to keep constantly on foot, made it  necessary for them to impose new tributes on their Moslem subjects, although  every exaction of the kind is expressly forbidden by the text of the law. The  amount of taxes thus collected in the time of the Sultans of the house of Umeyyah  has been differently estimated by various writers. The geographer Ibnu Haukal  says that under ’Abdu-r-rahmdén I. they amounted only to 300,000 dinars, a  sum which was collected from the principal cities according to their trade and  the wealth of their inhabitants, each contributing a fixed quota towards the making  up of the total sum. The contributions thus levied were divided into three equal  portions : one-third was spent in the maintenance of the army ; another went to  pay the salaries of civil officers and judges, and to defray all the expenses of  the administration ; while the remainder was deposited in the coffers of the Khalif",164,book_1,chapter_8
"    CHAP. VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. . 111    to meet cases of emergency, sudden invasions of the enemy, and so forth. But,  in our opinion, this statement is not correct; Ibnu Haukal can only speak of  the legal tax called zakah,** and not of all the other contributions, or else they  were enormously increased under the reign of his successors, for we are told that  under ’Abdu-r-rahmdén al-ausatt*® the sums levied amounted to one million of  dinars every year, and that under his father’s administration they were computed  at seven hundred thousand, which makes more than double the sum stated by  that geographer. Moreover, the revenues of Andalus must have increased in a  still greater proportion under his grandson ’Abdu-r-rahman III., since, in the  words of Ibn Khallekén, Ibnu Bashkiwél, and other historians, they are said to  have amounted to five millions four hundred and eighty thousand din4rs,“ without  including in that sum either the duties raised on all articles of sale, or the con-,  tribution called al-mostkhaldss,““ which amounted to seven hundred and sixty-five  thousand dinars. But of this more will be said when we come to the reign of  *Abdu-r-rahman An-nassir.",165,book_1,chapter_8

Ir now behoves us to say something on the manners and customs of the inhabitants  of Andalus ; their piety, their aptitude for the sciences, their courage, their gene-  rosity, their wit, and a thousand eminent qualities by which they have become  famous among the nations. We shall begin with their attachment to the internal  dogmas as well as the exterior practices of religion. This may be said, in a certain  measure, to have been more or less strong according to time and circumstances,  and to have been determined by the religious habits and the conduct of the head of  the state himself. However, it must be owned that, with a few exceptions, the  precepts of religion were always held in the greatest awe and veneration, and all  innovations or heretical practices abhorred and looked upon with contempt.  Indeed, the disapprobation of the people in matters of this kind was so strong,  that we are told by the historians of the time that it would have been a dangerous  thing for any theologian, whatever might have been his birth or authority, to show  the least deviation from the true spirit of religion; and that had a favourite or a  relation of the Khalif been guilty of any heretical practice, and had the Sultan  countenanced him in it, or not shown in some way his censure, the mob would  have soon penetrated into his strong palace, and, in spite of his body-guard, seized  on their victim, torn him to pieces, or expelled him from the city. This was of  frequent occurrence during the reign of the Beni Umeyyah, as also the pelting  of judges and governors whenever the inhabitants thought that proper justice  was not given to them in their trials, or that they were despotically treated by  their rulers.

There are various opinions  entertained as to the reasons which induced the Sultan to make that innovation;  the most current being that several Andalusian doctors happening to go to Medina,  and having become acquainted with the Im4m Malik, then residing in that city,  and having heard from his own mouth the exposition of his sublime doctrines,  were deeply impressed with their truth, and on their return to Andalus began to  spread and preach them every where, expatiating in praise of their master, boasting  of his virtues, his influence, his wide-spread fame, and the high estimation in  which he was held by all classes of the people. This having reached the ears of  Al-hakem, he held several conferences with them, and the result was that, being  convinced of the purity and advantages of their doctrines, he issued immediate  orders for the establishment of the sect of Mélik Ibn Ans throughout his do-  minions. : ;   Others assert that the Imam Malik having once interrogated an Andalusian  doctor, whom he happened to meet at Medina, as to the habits and mode of  life of the sovereigns of the house of Merwdn, was very much surprised and  gratified to hear that Al-hakem led a most exemplary and irreproachable life,  offering a contrast to the conduct of the ’Abbasside Khalifs, and especially of Abi  Ja’far Al-mansir, who, as is well known and may be read in the history of the  time, was then persecuting the descendants and partisans of ’Ali, casting them into  prison, and subjecting them to all manner of ill treatment, for which reason  Malik never failed to censure his proceedings: hearing, therefore, of the praise-  worthy conduct of Al-hakem Ibn Hishdém, he is said to have exclaimed in rapture,  ‘God grant that he may be one of ours,” or words to that purport.? This wish  having been communicated to the Sultén by the doctor in whose presence it was  expressed, they say that Al-hakem, who was already informed of the great repu-  tation which his virtues and sanctity had gained him, decided immediately upon  adopting the sect of Mélik and forsaking that of Al-auzé’ei. Among the Anda-  lusian doctors who contributed most efficaciously to bring about this change, either  by their words or by their writings, are counted ’Abdu-l-mdlik Ibn Habib, Yahya  Tbn Yahya Al-leythi, and Zey4d Al-lakhmi; but of this more will be said  hereafter.®   We find that in Andalus, as in the East, faquirs might be found in great   VOL.

There, as in the East, they were well acquainted with all  the arts and tricks of their profession, and knew how to give the face the appearance  of extreme hunger, in order to beg in the streets and market-places ; indeed their  filthiness and impudence seem to have been beyond description. However, we are  inclined to believe that they never were so numerous as in the East, nor did they  obtain in Andalus the same success which they had there, for Ibnu Sa’id tells us  that it was a general rule among his countrymen not to encourage idleness by  bestowing alms on people capable of gaining their livelihood by labour, and that if  an Andalusian happened to meet a strong and healthy man under such a disguise, he  would, instead of giving him alms, abuse him, and, by denouncing him to the  magistrates, have him cast into prison ; this is the reason why beggars were at all  times scarce in Andalus,—those, however, always excepted, who, through some  corporeal defect, could not earn their living. However, the judgment that we  have passed on the faquirs of Andalus must be applied to the generality, not to all,  for there were among them men who, moved by sentiments of piety and devotion,  left the world and its vanities, and either retired to convents to pass the remainder  of their lives among brethren of the same community, or, putting on the darwdzah  and grasping the staff of the faquir, went through the country begging a scanty  pittance, and moving the faithful to compassion by their wretched and revolting  appearance. The following anecdote, which we extract from the celebrated work by  Ar-ré’ii, entitled ‘‘the book of luminous introduction to the knowledge of those  ‘ qualities which a faquir ought to have,’’® will convey some idea of their customs  and habits. ‘‘ It happened once,” says that author, ‘“ that the Sherif Abd-l-ma’Ali,  “son of Abi-l-k4sim Al-hiseyn, Kédi-l-kod4 of Granada,® and commentator of  “ the Al-khazrajlyeh, and the Makssirah’ of Hazem, a man not only illustrious by  “his birth,—for both his father and mother were descendants of Hasan, and  ‘* consequently of the family of the Prophet,—but by his virtues and eminent  “ qualities, renounced at once all his dignities and employments, and gave himself  “up entirely to devotion and abstinence. Being a man of profound learning and  “* great piety, of amiable disposition and courteous manners, he won the esteem of  “« every one of his fellow-citizens, and became the object towards which the fingers of  ‘the people of this world and of the world to come were universally pointing. He  “« had a brother whose name was Abi-l-’abbés Ahmed, K4di of a town in the eastern  “ districts of Andalus, but who was then residing in Granada; with him Abi-l-  “‘ ma’4li dwelt, but he would never eat any thing in his house because he was in  “the employment of the Sultan: he would, whenever he felt hungry, go to his  “« brother, and say to him, ‘ Brother, I am hungry, give me a dirhem that I may buy",168,book_2,chapter_1

In this way he lived for several years, persevering in his resolution,  “and depriving himself of every one of the comforts which the world bestows,  “ until one day he bent his steps towards a convent in the outskirts of Granada,  “called Zdwiyatu-l-mahrik (the convent of the burnt),® and addressing himself  “to its inmates, whose superior at the time was Abi Ja’far Ahmed Al-mahdiid, he  “* said to them, ‘ My friends! I had a lamp to light myself with, and I have lost it,  “so that I cannot see at all;’ and the superior replied to him, ‘O Sherif! I cannot  “answer thee, but the first man who happens to come here shall do it to thy  “* gatisfaction.” Few minutes had elapsed before one of the many holy men who  “‘ used to visit the convent made his appearance, and sat himself by the side of  “ Abi Ja’far, who addressed him thus,—' Brother, this Sherif has just now put a  “‘ question to our community, and I have told him that the first man who should  “enter here would answer it for him; so hear what he has got to say, and reply  “to him.’ Abi-l-ma’éli then repeated his words,—‘ I had a lamp to light myself  “with, and I have lost it, so that I cannot see at all:’ the stranger then said,  “* Well, that only shows a breach of discipline, thou must tell me more:’ then  “ Abé-l-ma’4li said, ‘I do not remember any fault I have committed, unless it be  “that when so and so incurred the displeasure of the Sultan, and concealed himself  “ for fear of the approaching chastisement, I passed one day by his house, and he  “ called me through the wicket of his door, and begged me to pray to God in his  “ behalf, and I said to him—repeat such and such a prayer,—meaning one which  “* contains all the illustrious names of the Almighty God, and which is well known  “to be an efficacious remedy against all calamities present and to come; a prayer  “ which is recorded by Al-biini in his Al-muntekhab,® and has repeatedly produced  “the most miraculous effects, and was communicated to me by my brother Ahmed  “ Ash-sherif, who had it from one of his disciples.’ When the faquir heard this,  “ he said, ‘ And when this took place hadst thou permission to admonish him ?’  “© No,’ answered Abii-l-ma’éli. ‘Well then,’ said the faquir, ‘it is of no use  “asking for thy lamp, thou shalt never recover it, and the light shall never be  “ restored to thee, for thou hast committed a breach of the rules which every  “faquir ought to observe.’ And so it happened; for some time after this  “ Abi-l-ma’4li returned to the world, and, putting an end to his austerity and  ‘ abstinence, accepted the office of Kdédi which was offered to him, and served  “ kings, ate at their tables, and accepted their presents.

"    Costume of  the Andalu-  sians.    116 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book 11.    - “ The inhabitants of Andalus,” says Ibnu Sa’fd, ‘dress somewhat differently  “ from their Moslem brethren of Asia. They have left off the turban, especially  ‘in the eastern provinces; in the western, however, it is still used by people  “of rank and wealth, or those holding situations under government.{ Thou wilt  “never see in Cordova or in Seville a K4di or a Faquih without his turban; in  ‘* Valencia, Murcia, and other provinces of the east of Spain, on the contrary, it is  ‘* quite common to see men of the highest rank walk about the streets with bare  ‘heads; as to the lower classes, they never use the turban. I recollect once  “seeing in Murcia one of the most distinguished and respected Ulemas of the city  “ appear before the Sultén who then reigned in those districts; he wore nothing  “on his head, and his white hair, shining bright among his black locks, had the  “* most ludicrous appearance. Military officers, soldiers, and men of the inferior  “classes, have likewise left it off, even in the western provinces. Ibn Hid,”  “formerly King of Saragossa, and who in our days reduced to obedience the  “greatest part of Andalus, never used a turban; I accompanied him in most  ‘of his military expeditions, and always saw him without it. I might say the  “same of Ibnu-l-ahmar, who is the present ruler of this country.   “* The cloak called taylasdn™ is used by all classes of the people, men of rank  ‘as well as plebeians, so that thou wilt never see an Andalusian go out into the  ‘ street without having his cloak on, the only difference being that Sheikhs and  “‘ other people of distinction throw their hood over their heads, whilst common  “ people never do so. Woollen caps are generally used as a substitute for turbans ;  ‘« the colours most worn are either red or green; yellow is reserved for the Jews,  “‘ who, on no occasion, are allowed to use any other. The hair is cut short, only  “ Kaédis and Ulemas wear it long; but instead of letting it hang over their  ‘shoulders, as is the fashion in the East, they wear it loose underneath the  “* left ear. ;   “Even the people who use turbans follow a fashion of their own, and seem  ‘entirely to disregard the multifarious shapes used by people of rank and dis-  “ tinction in other Moslem states ; so if an eastern Arab happens to come among  “ them, wearing a turban in the Syrian or Hejazi fashion,—and large high things  “they are, looking like towers,—they will show great astonishment, and appear  “much struck with the novelty; but instead of admiring its shape and structure,  * they will burst out laughing, and jest at the expense of the wearer, for in general  “the Andalusians are very slow in adopting the fashions of other nations, and  “‘ neither admire nor like any thing but their own. They are also the cleanest  “people on earth in what regards their person, dress, beds, and in the interior  “ of their houses ; indeed, they carry cleanliness to such an extreme that it is not",170,book_2,chapter_1

Sultans, military officers, and even the common soldiers, followed the fashions Hates  of the infidels; in time of war, especially, they wore a dress very similar to in time of war.  that of the Christians, their neighbours. They used likewise the same weapons,  and, like them, were clad in mail, over which they threw a short scarlet tunic,  in the Christian fashion. They fought on horseback with shield and spear,  but knew not how to use either the mace or the bow of the Arabs; instead of  which they adopted the cross-bow of the Franks, and used it in sieges, or in  marches, to defend the infantry from the attacks of cavalry, for without that  requisite they would certainly be defeated. However, we are informed by Ibnu-  l-khattib that under the Merinite Sulténs, who reigned at Granada, the Anda-  lusian troops were again clad and armed in the real Arabic fashion; instead  of the heavy steel helmet and thick breast-plate of their ancestors, they then  wore a slender head-piece, and a thin but well-tempered cuirass; instead of  the huge spear with a broad end in the Christian fashion, they took the long  and slender reed of the Arabs, and they substituted for the clumsy and ill-shaped  Christian saddle the more military-looking and more convenient horse furniture  of the inhabitants of Arabia.'?   The character of the Andalusian Arabs has been thus described by Ibnu Ghélib To eminent  in his Kitdb > forjati-l-anfus (the book of contentment of the soul), a work to’ anes  which we have more than once referred in the course of our narrative. ‘‘ The  “ Andalusians,” sseye<he; “ are Arabs by descent, in pride, in the haughtiness of  “their temper, the elevation of their minds, the goodness of their heart, and  “the purity of their intentions; they resemble them in their abhorrence of every  “thing that is cruel or oppressive, in their inability to endure subjection or  “contempt, and in the liberal expenditure of whatever they possess. They are  “Indians in their love of learning, as well as in their assiduous cultivation of  “ science, their firm adherence to its principles, and the scrupulous attention  “with which they transmit down to their posterity its invaluable secrets. They  “are like the people of Baghddd in cleanliness of person and beauty of form,  ‘Celegance of manners, in mildness of disposition, subtilty of mind, power of  “thought, extent of memory, and universality of talent. They are Turks in  “ their aptitude for war, their deep acquaintance with every one of its stratagems,   “and their skilful preparation of the weapons and machines used in it, as well  “as their extreme care and foresight in all matters concerning it.

Such is the treatise on agriculture  “by Ibn Bassdl,'S an Andalusian, which is in the hands of every farmer, and  “the merits of which have been sufficiently appreciated by all those who have  “* followed its valuable instructions. The Andalusians, moreover, are the most  “* patient of men, and the fittest to endure fatigue ; they are thereby well qualified  “for labour of every description ; they likewise show great inclination for war,  ‘* and have on all occasions proved to be active, brave, and intelligent soldiers}”’   Various authors have dwelt at large on the great similarity existing between  the Andalusian Moslems and the Greeks, but it is easily accounted for by the  circumstance that the Greeks for a long time inhabited Andalus, and the Moslems  became thereby the inheritors of all their knowledge in the sciences.   Tbnu Ghélib continues, ‘‘ We may enumerate among the eminent qualifications  ‘of the inhabitants of Andalus that of having been the inventors of the species  ** of verse called al-muwashahah, which has not only been approved of by Eastern  “ critics, but adopted and used by their poets, and made the theme of public  “ literary competitions. As to their poems in the common kinds of metre, and  “their works in prose, nobody who has read them will deny that they stand high  “in the scale of merit.   “The skill of their workmen in all kinds of handicraft has been sufficiently  “acknowledged by travellers from the East, and other Mohammedan countries,  ‘‘who have lived among them; many are the articles now manufactured in  “ Andalus which are in high repute, and form the staple of considerable trade  ‘with Moslems and Christians: Africa may be said to have derived its present  “wealth and importance, and its extent of commerce, from Andalusians settling  “in it.

Through their means the countries  “where they fixed their residence became at once prosperous and rich, and  “ the inhabitants saw their wealth increase rapidly, as well as their comforts and  “* enjoyments. ‘   “The inhabitants of cities being for the most part well educated people, and  “ being versed in all the branches of learning and polite literature, soon made  “themselves conspicuous and known at court, or in the chief towns where  “they settled. They filled posts of distinction in the state, and were appointed  “to the charges of Wizirs, Katibs, governors of provinces and districts, tax  “collectors, and other offices under government, so that there was no district  “in Africa wherein some of the principal authorities were not Andalusians.   ‘« But it was in the class of operatives and workmen in all sorts of handicrafts They teach the  “ that Africa derived the most advantage from the tides of emigration setting towards etic  “its shores. It is well known that before the arrival of the Andalusians many  “of the trades which are now in a flourishing state were hardly known in Africa,  “and that in activity and dexterity the emigrants ranked far above the native  “workmen. So, for instance, if they undertook the building of an edifice they  “ completed it in the shortest possible time, and finished every thing so beautifully,  “and with such a perfection of design, that they won the hearts and affections  “of their employers, and their reputation grew immense among the people ;  “these being notorious facts, which none but the ignorant or the ill-intentioned  “could deny.”   Such are Ibnu Ghdlib’s expressions, transcribed literally from Ibnu Sa’id’s work,  where they may be found, with other curious information on the subject. The latter  author himself, making as it were a comment on Ibnu Ghalib’s words, and recording  some of the good qualities which the Andalusians were known to possess, adds as  follows: ‘‘ God Almighty knows it is not my intention to flatter my countrymen,  “but mierely to state the truth, following those impartial writers who are neither  “ carried away by the love of their country, nor diverted from truth through envy  “or malevolence ; my motto shall be, ‘ the path of truth is the surest path to  “ follow.’'7_ Perhaps some of my readers, in perusing the account I have just",173,book_2,chapter_1

Yet it is a known fact that the capital of Al-maghreb was never so  “ flourishing as under the reign of the Beni ’Abdi-l-mimen, who took thither  ‘* workmen and operatives from all parts of their Andalusian dominions. This is  “‘ notorious, and needs no confirmation: the same might be said of the city of  “ Tunis, in Africa proper, to which in my times the prosperity and splendour of  ““ Morocco may be said to have migrated, owing to the present Sultan, Abi  “« Zakariyya Yahya Ibn Abi Mohammed Ibn Abi Hafs,’® having fixed his court  “in it. This prince has erected buildings, constructed palaces, and planted  “‘ gardens and vineyards in the Andalusian fashion: all his architects are natives  “« of this country, as likewise most of his masons, carpenters, bricklayers, painters,  ‘“‘ and gardeners. The plans were either designed by Andalusians or copied from  “ buildings in their country ; and although the Sultan himself is a very good judge  “in these matters, and has an exquisite taste, yet it is well knot that the  “‘ mosques, palaces, and gardens erected by him, and so much admired by the  *« Africans, are mere copies of similar buildings in our country. So, as far as   “ this goes, it is clearly demonstrated that Ibnu Ghdlib told the truth.”",174,book_2,chapter_1

Character of the Andalusians—Their hospitality—Their courage in battle—Their haughtiness of  temper—Devotion to their friends—Their justice—Forgiveness—Generosity.    Tue qualities of the Andalusians are as brilliant and manifest as the beauties of Character of  the country they inhabit are shining and conspicuous. The same author that sians.  we have mentioned elsewhere (Ibnu Ghalib) affirms, on the authority of Ptolemy,  that, owing to the influence exercised by the planet Venus, the people of Andalus  are endowed with a lively imagination, elegance of manners, exquisite taste in  food, clothing, and whatever concerns their persons, cleanliness, and love of  pleasure and music. Mercury imparts to them inclination to economy and’  orderly habits, ardour in the acquisition of learning, love of philosophy and the  natural sciences, justice and impartiality in their judgments.   Tbnu Ghalib goes on detailing the qualities which are assigned to the Andalusians  on account of the influence exercised over them by Vulcan, Saturn, and Jupiter ;  but in this the author was wrong, since it is well known that only the fourth  and fifth climates pass over Andalus, the sixth passing close to its northern shores,  and the seventh by the islands of the Majis. The Sun is the planet of the fourth  climate, Venus of the fifth, Mercury of the sixth, and the Moon of the seventh ;  as to the second and third, they are in no way connected with Andalus.   We shall now enumerate some of their brilliant qualities, which we shall illustrate  by examples, that they may be more deeply impressed on the minds of our readers.  The Andalusians were justly renowned for their hospitality towards strangers, and Hospitality.  their histories abound in acts which rank them far above the other Moslems in  the exercise of that virtue. It is said of the Khalif ’Abdu-r-rahmdn III. that  on the arrival of Zary4b, the musician,’ at Cordova, he not only rode forth himself  to receive and welcome him, but entertained him for several months in his own  palace, and made him considerable presents; an action which is praiseworthy  enough in an equal, but which in a superior, and a Sultan so powerful and   VOL, 1. 2 R",175,book_2,chapter_2

The geographer Al-bekri, in his description of Africa, mentions another instance  of remarkable hospitality on the part of the same Sultén. Having heard that  Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Abi ’Isa, Kéddt-l-jemd’h (or supreme judge) at Fez,  intended to cross over from Ceuta, the place of his residence, to Andalus, in  order to engage in some military expeditions against the Christians, he -ordered  that he should be written to in his name, pressing him to come, and apprising  him that he was not to lodge any where during his travels but in houses belonging  to the Sultén. Accordingly, between Algesiras, the place of his landing, and  Baldt Hamid,’ a place in the furthest frontier, where-the army was then encamping,  palaces were built by ’Abdu-r-rahmén’s orders, in which Mohammed was duly  received and lodged. The expenses of the erection of the palaces, thirty in number  (one for each day or station), being one thousand mithcals each.   “The Andalusians,” says Ibnu Sa’id, ‘‘ are both economical and orderly in  “ their habits; they are very careful of whatever property they possess, a circum-  ** stance which has induced some authors to stigmatize them as misers.   “Tn illustration of this I shall here relate an adventure which occurred to me  “‘ whilst in Andalus. I was once travelling with my father in one of the eastern  “ provinces when we were caught in a storm of rain and wind. It was then  “winter, and the cold was intense; the clouds poured down upon us more  “‘ water than the Nile itself has in its bed. Lightning crossed our sight, thunder  “ roared over our heads, we were wet through and perishing with cold, so that  “we determined upon directing our steps to a neighbouring village, and asking  ‘hospitality from the first inhabitant we should meet. It must be observed  “that both my father and I were at that time under the jealous vigilance* of  “the Sultén, and unprovided with sufficient means to take any other determi-  “nation. We therefore went to a house and knocked at the door; the owner,  ‘“‘a respectable old man, whom we had never seen before, soon opened it and  ‘admitted us into his house ; he received us with great kindness, and said soon  “ afterwards, ‘ If you have any money to give me I will buy charcoal and light  “a fire, that you may dry your clothes and warm yourselves; I will also go to  “market and get such provisions as you may want, and my people will dress  “them for you.’ We did what we were desired,—we gave him money to make  ‘‘ his purchases, and he soon came back and lighted a very good fire. While  ““we were warming ourselves at it, in came a young lad, apparently a son of  “our host, who, approaching the fire, began to warm himself, but no sooner",176,book_2,chapter_2
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 123    “did the father perceive it than he came up to his son, gave him a beating,  “and sent him away from it. ‘What dost thou beat this boy for?’ said my  “ father to our host. ‘I beat him,’ replied the old man, ‘that he may accustom  “himself from childhood to cold-and privation, and be thereby enabled: to earn  “his subsistence and provide for himself after I am dead.’ When it was time  “* to go to bed the old man said to the youth, ‘Give that thick cloak* of yours  “to this young man,’ pointing to me, ‘that he may add it to his covering and  ‘sleep more comfortably,’ and he did as desired. When I awoke in the morning  “I observed that the youth was also awake and holding in his hands one of  “the corners of his cloak. I afterwards communicated this observation to my  “father, who said to me, ‘Do not wonder at it, for this is a thing that happens  “every day, and it is in the character of the Andalusians to show the greatest  “ “ hospitality and benevolence towards their guests, at the same time that they   “use excessive precautions concerning their property. So, for instance, this man  “gave thee his cloak, in doing which he preferred thy comfort to his own, but,   “at the same time, seeing thee a stranger, and not knowing whether thou wert  “an honest man or a thief, prudence dictated to him not to go to sleep without  “ holding the cloak in his hand, lest thou shouldst run away with it in the  “ morning while he was asleep,—thus spoiling by his mean conduct all the merits  “of his generous action.’” The preceding anecdote is copied from Ibnu Sa’id  in his Al-mugh’rab.   The Andalusians have always been renowned for their intrepidity and courage, Courage.  and their history is full of acts of bravery and heroism scarcely to be equalled  by any other nation. It is related of the Amir Abt ’Abdillah Ibn Mardanish *  that whenever he’ came to close quarters with the infidels he used, regardless of  his life, to dash into the thickest of the mélee, where he performed such prodigies  of valour that his very enemies remained motionless with astonishment: on one  of these occasions, while he was charging the thick squadrons of the Christians,  and dispersing them like dust right and left, he was heard to exclaim—   “‘ When I plunge into the close ranks of the enemy, it matters not to me  ‘‘ whether I find my death in the midst of them or elsewhere.” ¢   On another occasion, having been attacked by superior forces, he required all  his courage and ability to extricate himself from his dangerous position. The  Christians closed on all sides upon him, but instead of losing courage he animated  his followers, and making a most desperate charge against the enemy, penetrated  into their ranks, unhorsed and killed their most valiant knights, and succeeded in‘  disengaging himself, after performing such feats of arms that he himself was  astonished. Then turning round to one of his favourite captains, an experienced",177,book_2,chapter_2
"    124 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK 11.    old warrior who had seen many a battle, and was well versed in all the chances of  war,—‘‘ What thinkest thou of all this?” said he. ‘‘ My opinion,” answered the  veteran, ‘‘ is, that had the Sultan witnessed the extraordinary feats of arms that  ‘thou hast just been performing, he would unquestionably have increased the  ‘* pension already allotted to thee from his treasury, and raised thee in honour and  ‘* command ; but on the other hand I doubt whether he would not have been angry  ‘* to see thee expose thy life in the manner thou hast done, for it becomes not the  “ general of an army to hazard his life more than is necessary, lest by so doing he  ‘should cause the destruction of his whole army.” ‘‘ Well, that may be so,”  replied Ibn Mardanish, ‘‘ but man dies not twice; and if I am killed, others may  ‘* save their lives by my death.” 7   Another famous warrior, whose name was the K4id Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Kadis,  is also much spoken of by the Andalusian historians. They say that he made  himself so conspicuous by his courage and his prowess against the enemy, as well as  by the forays he made into their territory, that his name was well known to the  meanest soldiers in the Christian camp, and that the single mention of it was  sufficient to cast terror into the heart of the stoutest knight. In confirmation  whereof an anecdote is told of a Christian warrior, who once approached a brook in  order to give his steed water ; when the animal pranced, reared, and would not  come near it. ‘‘ What ails thee?” said the soldier, addressing his horse, ‘ hast  thou seen Ibn Kadis in the water?”*® And this was no doubt a great distinction,  tending to prove the great estimation and awe in which the warrior was held by  the Christians, owing to the brilliant feats of arms he was seen to perform on  every occasion.   The same author from whom we have borrowed the preceding anecdote mentions  another very curious one, which he says he had from a trustworthy friend and eye-  witness. Ibn Kadts once left the frontiers of the Moslem dominions at the head  of a small but chosen band of resolute followers, in order to make a foray into  the enemy’s territory. However, he soon fell in with a considerable body of the  Christian troops, by which he was surrounded, and placed in imminent danger  of being made prisoner. But Ibn Kadtis being a brave and experienced warrior,  and knowing that he could rely on the courage and devotion of his handful of  men, instead of being frightened at the superior numbers of the enemy, rose in  his stirrups, said a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and, putting himself  at their head, plunged into the close ranks of the enemy, which he scattered and  dispersed right and left; thereby opening himself a passage, and disengaging his  small force without the loss of a single man. He then began to retire in good order  towards his camp, being closely followed by the Christians, but as he was retreating",178,book_2,chapter_2
"    CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 125    and fighting, one of his men who had remained considerably behind was unhorsed,  and his steed ran away. The soldier then implored the assistance of his captain,  who hastening back to him said—‘‘ Wait a moment, and defend thyself on foot  “till I get thee a horse ; ”—saying which, he rode to the nearest Christian horse-  man, threw him down at the very first onset, took his steed, and gave it to his  dismounted soldier, who was thereby enabled to join the main body. Many similar  feats of arms are recorded of this valiant captain. :   Hariz Ibn ’Okkéshah,® of the posterity of ""Okkéshah Ibn Mahiss, the com-  panion of the Prophet, is also counted among the bravest warriors that Andalus  ever produced. He was a man of colossal size and enormous strength, and few  were the warriors whom his arm reached in the heat of battle who ever escaped  with their lives. It once happened that Adfonsh’® (Alfonso), one of the infidel  kings of Andalus, at the head of considerable forces invaded the territories in which  Hariz commanded, and began, as was the custom in similar expeditions, to burn  the fields, to destroy the farm-houses, cut down the trees, and commit all sorts of  ravages. Wo sooner was Hariz acquainted with the invasion than he dispatched a  messenger to Alfonso, with a letter conceived in the following terms :—‘“‘ Desist  “from thy work of destruction, and spare misery and calamity to the creatures  “of the Almighty, for if it be decreed by Him that this country shall be thine,  “there is no need for thee to waste and destroy the land of thy future dominions ;  “ while, on the contrary, if it be written that thou shalt not conquer it, this country  “shall never be thine, even if thou hadst ten times the number of troops now  “under thy command.” On the receipt of this letter Alfonso ordered his host  to halt and abstain from further ravages ; he, moreover, feeling a great curiosity  to see a warrior of whom he had heard so much, sent him a messenger, requesting  him to come to his camp, and offering to give as hostages for the security of his  person a certain number of noblemen"" of his suite. Hariz consented, and the  necessary arrangements having been made, he set out for the camp of the Christian  monarch. On his arrival at Medinatu-I-baydhd,'* which is the same as Kal’at-Rabdh  (Calatrava), west of Toledo, Hariz rode through the streets of that city, and being  a very handsome man, of gigantic size, mounted on a powerful war-horse, and  completely cased in steel, the eyes of the people were fixed on him, for he was  really a beautiful sight to contemplate. The inhabitants of the places through  which he passed all came out to look at him, and gazed with astonishment at  the immense size of his body, the muscular strength of his limbs, the beauty and  polish of his armour and weapons, and his majestic and warlike demeanour ; they  moreover told each other tales of his martial exploits and invincible courage. On  his reaching the King’s tents, which were not far distant, all the principal noblemen",179,book_2,chapter_2
"    126 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK 11.    went out to meet him, welcomed and greeted him, and received him with the  greatest courtesy and distinction. When Hariz was about to dismount he planted  his spear in the earth so deeply and with so much force that the King, who was  present, felt fully convinced, by that act alone, of all the extent of his gallantry  and strength, while all the bystanders were seized with irrepressible fear, and  the countenances of his bravest knights appeared darkened with the terror which  they in vain tried to conceal. There happened to be near the camp a large  enclosure,* wherein the King and his knights exercised in manly sports; to this  spot Alfonso led Hariz, and invited him to take a part in the tournament for which  preparations had already been made, and which was on the point of beginning.  “No,” said Hariz, ‘the true knight never measures his sword but with those who  “* equal him in strength, and as I maintain that there is nobody among you capable  “ of drawing out this my spear which I have fixed in the ground, I shall not accept  “thy invitation; but if there be any one among you who believes he can do it,  “let him mount and try, and if he succeed I am ready to encounter him, one  “ or ten.” No sooner had Hariz uttered this challenge, than most of the knights  then present mounted their horses, and began to try their strength, but not one  amongst them succeeded in pulling out the spear fixed by Hariz; in vain did they  redouble their exertions and repeat the trial several times, the spear moved not an  inch from the spot where it had been planted by Hariz. Alfonso was not a little  astonished and grieved to see his knights so unsuccessful, but at last he was  compelled to say to Hariz, ‘‘ Thou art right, O warrior! let us see how thou dost  “‘it;” upon which, Hariz, leaping on his horse, galloped to the spot, and with  the slightest motion of his hand tore up his spear, the whole being done with the  greatest ease and elegance. All the bystanders remained dumb with admiration  when they saw the performance of Hariz, and the King himself bade him approach,  spoke to him graciously, and treated him with great regard and distinction.   This Hariz was likewise an excellent poet,.as may be gathered from the following  verses, which he wrote to the Kétib Abi-l-motref Ibnu-l-muthanna, secretary to  Tbnu Dhi-l-nin, King of Toledo. As Abv-l-motref was once travelling from  Cordova to Toledo, he happened to pass by the castle of Hariz,’* which stands on  the road between those two cities; Abi-l-motref lodged at a house outside the  walls, and soon after his arrival sent a message to Hariz, asking him for some  wine. The message was in verse, and thus conceived :   “O incomparable man! O phcenix of the age! O new moon among the  “ nobles !   “* Alas! wine is wanting, and has become as scarce as the ointment of the  “ balsam tree.” !®",180,book_2,chapter_2
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 127    And Hariz sent him down some, with the following answer, in the same metre  and rhyme :  “*O inestimable pearl ! O thou, the first among the illustrious men of past  ‘* times !  ‘« We have received thy verses resembling a garden refreshed by the gales  “* of eloquence,  “« And we send thee wine as sweet and well-flavoured as thy character and  “* disposition are mild.” *®  When Al-muktadir-billah Ibn Hiid, Sultd4n of Andalus, sallied from Saragossa to  the frontiers to oppose the son of Radmir, the great Christian king, who at the  head of considerable forces had invaded his territory, there happened to be in his  host a Moslem of the name of Sa’d4rah who performed a feat of arms well worthy  of record. Both armies, which were equally numerous and well appointed, met in  an extensive plain in the neighbourhood of Huesca; the battle was engaged with  great fury on both sides, and maintained with equal animosity during the whole  day, until towards evening the cavalry of the Moslems began to give way. When  Al-muktadir saw this, he ordered into his presence a borderer named Sa’ddrah, a  man of tried courage, and equally renowned for his exploits and his experience in  the affairs of war. ‘‘ What thinkest thou,” said Al-muktadir to Sa’ddrah, “ will  “ be the result of this day?” Sa’ddrah cast his experienced eye over the plain, and,  shaking his head, significantly answered, “To tell thee truth, O Prince! yonder  “signs bode no good ;” and pointing towards the dense iron-clad masses of the  Christian cavalry dispersing the light horsemen of Al-muktadir, he added, ‘‘ Unless  “yonder iron wall be broken by some unforeseen accident, the day will be against  “us.” “Thou art right,” replied Al-muktadir, “things look rather cloudy ;  “ but what dost thou propose to do?” Sa’ddérah meditated an instant, and said,  “ Among the white tents that cover the declivity of that hill I can easily perceive  “in the centre that of the son of Radmir towering above the rest ; if thou grant me  “ permission I will go there in disguise and kill the tyrant with my own hand.”  “ Well said,” replied Al-muktadir ; “ if thou succeed, the favours of thy master shall  “be lavished on thee; if thou fail, the rewards of the Almighty will be thy recom-  “pense.” Sa’dérah then goes to his tent, puts on a dress similar to those used  by Christian knights, arms himself with weapons like theirs, and, mounting his  steed, plunges into the thickest of the mélée. Being well acquainted with the  language and customs of the Christians, he had no difficulty, after opening himself  a passage through their thronged ranks, to penetrate into their camp. He then  goes to the King’s tent, and having entered it, he sees the son of Radmir sitting  upon a throne, completely cased in steel, so that the eyes were the only visible",181,book_2,chapter_2

He then watches for some time his opportunity, and, pouncing  upon the Christian, with a small dagger wounds him in the eye through one of the  apertures in the vizor, and kills him. He then leaves the tent, and begins to cry  out at the top of his voice, “‘ The King is killed! The King is killed!” '” and the  news spreading like fire through the enemy’s camp, panic and consternation seize  the Christian warriors ; they give way in every direction, and the victory remains in  the hands of the Moslems, who never ceased slaughtering until their arms were  tired, and their swords shivered from dealing blows.   The princes of the family of Hiid who reigned at Saragossa in the fifth century  of the Hijra being continually at war, not only with the Christians who surrounded  them on every side, but with their brethren among the Moslems during the long  and bloody civil wars which ravaged that country, had naturally numerous armies  in the best order and military discipline, and generals to command them, who, from  their indomitable courage and superior tactics, cast terror into the hearts of the  infidels. There were also warriors of tried courage, and unparalleled dexterity in  the handling of weapons, who in single combat with the Christian knights never  failed to gain the victory over their adversaries. We shall relate here an anecdote  which, like the preceding, we borrow from the writings of ’Ali Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman  Ibn Hudheyl, of Granada. ‘“ Al-musta’in Ibn Hiid, King of Saragossa, made upon  “a certain occasion a successful invasion into the enemy’s territory. As he was  “* returning to his capital laden with plunder, and driving before him his prisoners  “and cattle, he saw from a distance a strong body of Christian cavalry waiting  “in a favourable position, on the road by which he had to pass, to attack  “him. When Al-musta’in came closer to them, he ordered the captives and  “ cattle to his rear-guard, formed his men in line of battle, and patiently waited  “ till the Christians should make their attack. The two armies were thus in  “ deadly silence waiting for the signal to engage in battle, when a Christian knight  “ of gigantic stature, clad in bright steel, and mounted upon a powerful black  ‘horse, made his appearance in front of the ranks, and challenged the Moslem  “‘ warriors to single combat. Presently a Moslem comes out to him, but, after a  “« few blows dealt and parried on both sides, the servant of God is unhorsed and  ‘« killed by his antagonist, the worshipper of the crucified ; seeing which, the infidels  “gave a shout of joy, and the faithful were afflicted and silent. Elated with-  “* success, the Christian knight rode his horse in front of the ranks, and exclaimed,  ““«Come on if ye dare, and if one be not sufficient, come three to one, I will fight  “ you all.’ These words filled the hearts of the Moslems with rage, but none came  ‘* out to fight with the Christian, who, proud of his victory, was cantering his horse  “ in front of the two armies, while the air resounded with the deafening shouts of his",182,book_2,chapter_2
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 129    “companions. In this extremity, Al-musta’in, whose heart was deeply afflicted to  “* see the shame falling upon his men, rode up to a captain of his, a man inured to  “battle from his childhood, and who had the reputation of being as brave as he  “« was dexterous in the wielding of arms. His name was Abi-l-walid Ibn Kayjin:  “ to him Al-musta’in went in his distress, and told him thus,—‘ O Abi-l-walid! hast  “ thou seen the arrogance of that Christian dog, and the insults he is heaping upon  “the Moslems?’ ‘I have,’ replied Al-walid, ‘but if my master grant me per-  “ mission to go out against him, I shall soon bring down his pride.’ ‘Thou hast  ‘it,’ said Al-musta’in, ‘and by Allah! if thou bring me his head, my gratitude for  “ the service will know no bounds.’ Having previously announced to the Chris-  “ tian that a Moslem champion would immediately appear, Abi-l-walid retired for  “a moment into his tent ; he put on a cotton shirt, and mounting on a milk-white  “ steed of his, which in swiftness far outstripped the winds, he rode out without  “ any other weapons than a scimitar by his side, and a long whip with a noose and  “an iron ball at the end in his right hand. When the Christian knight saw his  “ antagonist so whimsically arrayed,—‘ What,’ said he, struck with amazement,  “‘*when a Christian challenges the Moslems is there not in the whole army any  “ warrior to be sent against him but this groom with his whip?’ upon which he  “burst out laughing, and gave other evident signs of the contempt in which he  “held Abd-l-walid. However, they rushed furiously against one another; the  “ Christian, rising on his stirrups, aimed a dreadful blow at the head of Abi-l-  “‘ walid ; he avoided it by suddenly wheeling round his docile steed, and, turning  “as quick as lightning upon his adversary, struck him with his whip, entangled  “his neck in the noose, and, dragging him from his saddle, stretched him upon  “the ground. He then dismounted, and, drawing his scimitar, dispatched the  “ adventurous knight, whose gory head he threw at the feet of Al-musta’in.”   We need not expatiate any longer on the courage, the endurance, the discipline,  and other military virtues, of the Andalusian soldiers: suffice it to say, that so great  were their ardour in the pursuit, and their intrepidity in battle, that they became  almost proverbial in the East, where, according to Ibnu Sa’id, an Andalusian warrior  was synonymous with a brave man. It is true that, exposed as their country was  for so many centuries to the furious attacks of innumerable Christian nations,  dwelling within and out of its limits, the Moslems of Andalus found ample  opportunities to display and nurture in that vast field of battle their warlike  inclinations, to evince their ardent zeal for the propagation of Islam, and to show  at all times their eagerness to share in the rewards promised by God to the warriors  who fall in battle with the infidels.

And when at  last they bowed down their necks before the irresistible laws of fate, is there any  one who can blame them for it? No! the impenetrable decrees of the Almighty  must needs be executed on his creatures. God is great! God is great! There is  no God but him, the merciful, the compassionate !   No nation on earth is so ‘proud as the Andalusians, nor more unwilling to bear  tyranny, oppression, or contempt: indeed their disobedience to their rulers, and  their want of respect and submission to their superiors, have become almost pro-  verbial. In illustration of what we advance we shall quote a few anecdotes. It is  related of Shajé’, a freedman of Al-musta’in Ibn Hid, king of Saragossa, that he  once went upon an embassy from his master to Alfonso, the Christian king.  Having arrived at Medinah Sélim (Medina Celi), where the infidel was then  holding his court, he was soon afterwards introduced to the presence of the  Christian monarch, whom he found sitting on a throne of great elevation raised  on the very tomb of Al-mansir, and having his wife by his side leaning on him.  After hearing his message, Alfonso said to him, ‘‘ O Shaj4’! I am the king of the  “Moslems, and the conqueror of their country: dost thou not see me sitting on  “the very tomb of the bravest and most powerful among their kings?’ When  Shaja’ heard these expressions so injurious to his countrymen, he could not restrain  his passion, and he said very spiritedly, ‘If he whose remains lie under that  ‘“‘ marble were alive, and thou sitting so close to him, thou wouldst not say with  ‘impunity things offensive to him, neither wouldst thou occupy long the place  ** thou now art in.” ‘ Alfonso caught the allusion,” says Shaja’, “‘ and flew into a  “‘ most violent passion ; he rose from his seat, intending no doubt to strike me,  ‘but his wife interfered and said to him, ‘ This man is right; why should not  ‘* honour and glory reside in his countrymen as they do in thee ?’”   Another act is recorded of the Hafedh of Andalus, the Imém of the learned, the  chief of authors, the pearl of the poets, and the phcenix of his age, Abi Mohammed  ’Abdullah Ibn Ibrahim As-sanhdji Al-hijéri,!® the author of the Al-mas‘hab (chatterer).

Having alighted at the gate, he  knocked and asked for admission, but the sentry, who saw him arrayed in the  Beydawi dress, not knowing who he was, refused to let him in. After some  parley held with the guards at the gate, which was all of no avail, Abii Mohammed  addressed one of them and said, ‘‘ If thou do not let me go in, at least acquaint the  “ governor with my presence, and inquire whether it is his pleasure to see me.”  “ What !”” said the soldier, bursting out laughing, ‘thou see the governor! dost  “thou think that our Lord has nothing else to do but to admit thee to his  “ presence ?””? Abii Mohammed then retired a little apart, and, taking a reed-pen  and an ink-stand which he always wore suspended at his girdle, he wrote on a  piece of paper the following verses :  “ The illustrious governor of this castle never dismisses from his door the  « people of rank and merit.  “« There is now standing on the threshold a man from Silves, with an ode  “ which begins thus—  “««T have been possessed with an idea to sing thy praises, and to record thy  “ beneficent actions.’  “ Tf, after this, my Lord thinks that he ought to deprive himself of the sight of  “ one of his countrymen, and of the pleasure of listening to an ode of this description,  “he may, for he knows best what to do, and it is not for me to upbraid him.” He  then ordered one of his pages to take his letter to the governor, and waited outside  for the result. When the Kéid ’Abdu-l-mélik had perused the contents of the letter,  he wondered at it, and said immediately, ‘‘A man from Silves, with an ode be-  “ginning thus,—who can it be? unless it be the Wizir ’Ammér who has risen  “ from the dead, I know of nobody else answering the description,—let him come  “in.” Abt Mohammed was then introduced into the presence of the governor,  who was sitting with some friends; he entered the room, but instead of bowing  to the K4id, or addressing the company, he stood motionless at the door ; seeing  which, the people who were present took him for a rude and ill-bred man; they  tumed their backs upon him, and affected the greatest coolness and indifference : at  last, seeing that he still remained in the same position, one of the company said to  him, “What ails thee, O stranger? why dost thou not enter this room in the  “manner poets and all well-bred people do, and salute the governor as is the  “custom?” ‘I shall neither bow to the Kdid,” replied Abi Mohammed, “ nor  “ pay any attention to you, till I have made you all as angry and out of humour as  “ you made me by keeping me waiting so long at the gate of this castle, and till  “ you tell me who among you is the most favoured by the governor, in order that I  “ may in future, by courting him and gaining his favours, be sure of not receiving",185,book_2,chapter_2

Dost thou intend to revenge on  ‘us the errors of other people?” ‘No, God forbid!” replied Abi Mohammed,  ‘“‘T am, on the contrary, willing to forgive for thy sake the failings of others.”  When Aytib Ibn Matriéh revolted against ’Abdullah Ibn Balkin Ibn Habis,    -king of Granada,”' in the fifth century of the Hijra, and the seas of civil war    swelled and rose high in those districts, it happened that among those thrown by its  waves against the shore Aytib was one. The case being reported to Yusef Ibn  T4shfin, he was deprived of command and sentenced to death, with many others  among the rebels. When the executioner came to strangle him, his friends and  all those who were present, and who knew the great regard which Ibn Tashfin  entertained for him, begged him to say something in his favour, that it might be  reported to the Prince and obtain his pardon; but Ayib being a man of great  courage and determination, and exceedingly proud, would not consent to it; he  put his head within the noose, and, persisting in keeping it there notwithstanding  the entreaties of the bystanders to induce him to take it out and pronounce a word  of repentance, he soon met with his death,—may God forgive him !   It is related that the Wizir Al-walid Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Ibn Ghdnim™ was on  terms of intimate friendship with another brother Wizir, named Hashim Ibn ’Abdi-  1-’aziz ;> both exercised the same functions to the Sultén of Cordova, Mohammed,  son of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Al-améwi, of the family of Merwan, and had on several  occasions evinced their mutual love and affection, till Al-walid gave that proof  of attachment to his friend which forms the subject of this anecdote. When God  Almighty permitted that the Wizir Hdshim should incur the displeasure of the  Sultdn, and should be sent by him to prison, there happened to be at the palace a  council meeting, at which Al-walid was present in his capacity of Wizir. The  conversation having turned on the disgraced functionary and the misdeeds imputed  to him, the Sultan Mohammed, then addressing the assembly, spoke very slightly of  him, and accused him of frivolity and inconstancy, as well as of obstinacy and too  great a reliance on his own opinions. No one among those present undertook the  defence of the accused Wizir but Al-walid, who, rising from his couch, said,  “ O Prince! may the Almighty favour and prosper thee! Were I allowed to speak  ‘one word in behalf of my friend, I should say that it is not in the power of a  ‘* mortal to contend against fortune, or to escape the immutable decrees of fate.  “ Hashim did all he could, he consulted with the greatest care his friends and  “ advisers, and he fulfilled all the duties of a brave and experienced general; but  ‘if success did not attend his banners, it is no fault of his, for victory does not  ‘* always depend upon the general ; it is well known that he was betrayed by those",186,book_2,chapter_2

I have no doubt but that he has been slandered and calum-  “ niated by people who were envious of him, and who looked with an evil eye upon  “the favours lavished on him by his sovereign.” Mohammed was not a little  surprised to hear this speech of Al-walid ; he complimented him upon the strength  of his attachment to his friend, and his anger against Hashim being in a great  measure removed, he some time afterwards gave orders for his liberation.   Were we here to record the brilliant acts of justice which are told of the various  Sultans who reigned over Andalus, we should insensibly protract our present  narrative to an interminable length. However, as the distribution of justice with  an even hand is among the brightest qualifications of a sovereign, and one which  many of the Andalusians possessed in a superior degree, we shall here select a few  of the most striking anecdotes. As Al-manstir Ibn Abi ’A’mir was once sitting in  the audience-room of his palace, in came a man of the lower classes, and addressed  him in the following terms: ‘“O defender of truth ! O dispenser of justice ! I have a  ‘complaint to make against a servant of thy household; there he is, standing  “at thy side;” and he pointed to one of Al-manstr’s chief eunuchs, who,  being a favourite servant of the Hajib, exercised besides the functions of shield-  bearer™ near his person. ‘I have,” continued the man, ‘‘ summoned him several  “times to appear before the magistrate, but in vain; he has never come at the  “« appointed hour, I am tired of sueing him, and I thought I should never get any  “redress unless I came to thee.’’ Al-mansir then said to the man, ‘‘ Dost thou  “* really mean to say that thou hast a complaint to make against ’Abdu-r-rahman  “ Tbn Foteys?” Is it he whom thou accusest of thus disobeying the rules of justice?”  “The same,” replied the man. ‘‘ [should have thought,” said Al-mansir, frowning,  “that ’Abdu-r-rahm4n would have been the last person in my household to commit  “such a crime. Let us then hear thy grievance.” The man then stated that  he had entered into a contract with ’Abdu-r-rahman, by which both parties were  bound towards each other to the fulfilment of certain conditions, and that ’Abdu-r-    Justice.",187,book_2,chapter_2
"    134 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    rahman had of late without any sufficient reason refused to observe it. Al-mansir  then said, ‘‘ There is no servant in my household that I love more than him,  “* (darting on the Sclavonian a look by which he was almost annihilated,) but, by  “ Allah! justice must be done. Pass thy shield to thy neighbour, and come down  “before me, that I may send thee where thou mayest meet thy accuser, and be  “ either extolled or depressed by truth.” Then addressing his Sdhibu-sh-shartah,  intrusted with the execution of his private orders,—‘‘ Take that wretch, that criminal  “man, by the hand, and lead him together with his accuser before the magistrate,  “that he may investigate the case, and impose on him the punishment he  “* deserves ; and mark well, let the sentence, whether it be imprisonment or fine,  “be as rigorous as possible.” The Sahib did as he was ordered ; he took both the  parties before the magistrate, and shortly afterwards the complainant appeared  again before Al-mansir, and said he had got redress, and thanked him for having  obtained justice through his means. ‘ Well,” said Al-mansir, ‘‘ begone ; justice  “ has been done thee, and thou art revenged; it is now for me to get redress for  “‘ my injury, and to chastise the crimes committed by the people of my household.”  Upon which he ordered that the Sclavonian should be exposed to all sorts of  humiliation and ill treatment, and he was at last dismissed from his service.   On another occasion there happened to be a lawsuit between his chief eunuch  Al-biraki and a western merchant; they had disagreed in some money matters,  and the merchant brought the case before a tribunal. However, the eunuch being  at the head of Al-mansir’s household, having the entire management of his house  and harem, and possessing the confidence and favour of his master, was, as may  well be supposed, a very influential person in the state, and the magistrate pro-  nounced a decision in his favour. The merchant then appealed ; but the magistrate,  thinking that a man of high rank, and holding such an important situation as  Al-biraki did, could not be guilty of the breach of faith imputed to him, dismissed  the appeal. The merchant, however, was not disheartened, and he resolved upon  having justice, come what might. As Al-manstir was on a Friday riding to the  mosque, the merchant placed himself before his horse, and implored his justice  against Al-biraki. Al-manstir immediately ordered one of his escort to ride back  to his palace, take the eunuch into custody, and conduct him again before the ma-  gistrate, to whom he sent a message enjoining him to look again into the case.  The suit was tried, the eunuch convicted, and the merchant redressed. Al-mansiir,  moreover, was so much incensed against the culprit, that, after depriving him of all  the favours he had previously lavished on him, he dismissed him from his service,  and exiled him from Cordova.   The following act of justice is also recorded of Al-mu’atassem Ibn Samadeh,",188,book_2,chapter_2
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 135    king of Almeria. When that prince began to build the famous palace which, after  his name, was called As-samddehiyah, the architects, not finding room enough to  execute their plans, seized on some houses and fields adjoining the palace, and  united them to the main building. There happened to be among the pieces of  ground thus appropriated by the builders a small orchard belonging to a good old  man, who more than any other resented and opposed the spoliation, on the plea  that the piece of ground did not belong to him, but was the property of an orphan  of whom he was the guardian. As Al-mua’tassem was one day inspecting his  building, seated in his garden by the side of an artificial rivulet,” which was made  to wind through it, his eyes fell on something floating on the surface of the water,  and which, when taken up by his orders, proved to be a hollow reed, stopped with  wax at both ends. When the wax was removed, Al-mu’atassem found inside a  scroll of paper, in which the following words were written. ‘‘O thou! whoever  “ thou mayest be, into whose hands this scroll may happen to fall, remember those  “ words of the Almighty, ‘ This my brother has ninety-nine ewes, and I have only  “ one, and he said to me,—Do intrust her to my care,—which I did, but his words  “ proved false, and he deceived me ; there is no God but God !’* Thou art a king on  “ whom God has lavished his favours, making thee wealthy and powerful on earth,  “and yet, far from being satisfied, thy ambition prompts thee to covet the property of  “ others; and to add to thy spacious gardens a piece of ground belonging to an  “orphan, thereby committing an unlawful act, depriving a defenceless girl of all  “ means of subsistence, and taking advantage of thy power, and the importance of  “ thy situation, to do what is unjust. We shall to-morrow appear in the presence  “ of Him who never dismisses the wretched without aid or consolation, nor the  “offended without redress, and then beware of the consequences!” No sooner  had Al-mu’atassem perused the paper than his eyes were bathed in tears, and  his heart was possessed with fear at the terrible consequences which this incon-  siderate act of his servants might bring on him in future life; he immediately  commanded that all the workmen employed in the building of his palace should  appear in his presence, and when they were all assembled he interrogated them  as to what the anonymous paper stated, bidding them to expose the case, and  to tell nothing but the truth.: The masons then owned the fact, but alleged as  an excuse, that the piece of land occupied by the old man’s garden being absolutely  necessary for the finishing of the palace, the chief architect had deemed it indis-  pensable to seize on the orphan’s property, although unjustly and contrary to  the law. Upon which Al-mu’atassem, violently incensed, exclaimed, ‘‘ By Allah!  “sins of this description are much graver in the eyes of the Creator than they are  “in those of his creatures. Let the orchard be immediately restored to its owner.”",189,book_2,chapter_2
"    Forgiveness.    136 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    And so it was done, although it materially injured the front of his palace, which -  thus remained incomplete.   We have read somewhere that some of the principal and most learned citizens of  Almeria happening to pass shortly after this adventure by the palace of Al-  mu’atassem, one of them said to the others, pointing to the spot where the orphan’s  garden stood, spoiling the look of the building, ‘‘ By Allah! that orchard makes the  ‘* palace look as if it were a blind man.”—‘ Thou art right,” answered one of the  company, ‘‘ but in the eyes of the Almighty that spot constitutes its greatest  “ornament.” It is also related of Al-mu’atassem that whenever he cast his eyes  on it, he used to say “‘ I feel as if that empty spot in front of my palace was finet  ‘* than all the rest which is already finished.” However, in the course of time the  old man was prevailed upon to give up his ground; for Ibn Arkim,” who was  Al-mu’atassem’s Wizir, never ceased importuning the old guardian, and tempting  the orphan, till they consented to sell their property for the price which they  themselves fixed on it; the Sultan being thereby enabled to complete the building  of his famous palace, after performing such a signal act of justice as ensured him  the love and esteem of his subjects, and the future rewards of his Lord.   Nor was Al-mu’atassem famous only for such acts of justice as that which we  have just recorded ; he was also renowned for his benevolence and his forgiving  temper. It happened once that An-naheli Al-bathalidsi, a poet, to whom he  had been a very munificent and generous Lord, ‘all of a sudden left his court, and  repaired to that of Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbdd, king of Seville, where, regardless of  past favours, and showing the greatest ingratitude towards his former benefactor,  he began to praise the Sevillian monarch, who was not then on very good terms  with Al-mu’atassem. In one of his poetical compositions he introduced the fol-  lowing verse :   “ Tbnu ’Abbdd has every where routed and exterminated the Berbers; Tbnu  “« Ma’n has extirpated the fowls of the villages.” *°   However, it happened some time afterwards that An-naheli, forgetful of what he  had said, returned to Almeria; and no sooner did Al-mu’atassem hear of his arrival  than he invited him to an evening repast. An-naheli went accordingly to the  palace, where a numerous company was already assembled, and the tables spread, but  they contained no other victuals than a profusion of fowls dressed in various ways.  Astonished at what he saw, the poet could not help asking if there was no other  food to be procured in Almeria but fowls ; when the Sultan, rising from his couch,  said,—‘‘ Yes, but we wished to make thee pass for a liar, when thou didst say  “that Ibnu Ma’n had extirpated the fowls of the villages.” Upon which, An-  nahelf, trying to exculpate himself, said, ‘‘ God has given thee abundance of means,",190,book_2,chapter_2
"    CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 137    “and any one in thy rank of life would have done the same; but thy wrath ought  “rather to be directed against him who heard my expressions and repeated them  “ to thee.”   Al-mu’atassem answered nothing, and An-naheli left the room; but thinking  that he had incurred the wrath of the Sult4n, he feared for his life, and on his  return home he hastily made a few preparations, and left Almeria that same  night. :   However, some time afterwards An-naheli repented, and wishing to return to  Almeria he addressed to Ibnu Ma’n the following verses :   “ Tbnu Samédeh receives graciously those who deserted him; he pardons  “* crimes which the world after him will not pardon.   “« Almeria is a paradise, where every thing which Adam found may be  “ procured.” 3!   On the receipt of these verses Al-mu’atassem gave him leave to return, and was   kind and benevolent towards him.   sity is a virtue in which the Andalusians will not be found deficient by  those who peruse their history. It is related of the Amir Al-mundhir,® son of the  Sultan ’Abdu-r-rahman, that a slave-merchant once presented him with a beautiful  girl, named Tarab, who among other accomplishments possessed that of a sweet  voice, and great proficiency in music. No sooner had the eyes of Al-mundhir  contemplated her charms, and his ears listened to the ravishing melody of her  songs, than he lost his heart, and became deeply enamoured of his slave. Having  revolved ‘in his mind how he should reward the merchant, he called one of his  confidential servants, and said to him, ‘‘ What dost thou think we ought to give  “this man in return for his invaluable present, for this girl of incomparable  “ beauty ? ’—‘' O master!” answered the servant, ‘‘ methinks the best way would  “be to have her valued, and send him the amount in money.”—‘' Well said,”  replied Al-mundhir. A merchant was accordingly consulted on the subject, and  five hundred gold dindérs was the price set upon her. When the servant returned to  acquaint his master with the valuation, Al-mundhir said, ‘‘ Is that the proper reward  “ of a man who has presented us with a girl whose beauty has already captivated  “ our heart, and whose charms have won our affection? Are we only to send him  “ the sum thou hast mentioned, a sum which he would undoubtedly have received  “had he sold her to a Jewish merchant ?””—‘ Certainly,” replied the servant,  “but these merchants are an avaricious and miserly set, and every thing appears  “ inconsiderable in their eyes.”—‘‘ Never heed that,” said Al-mundhir, ‘“‘ we are  “liberal and bounteous, and ought not to stand upon trifles when we intend to  ‘* show our generosity ; take him one thousand dinérs, and give him our thanks for   VOL.

On the return of a similar occasion the same poet came again to  him, with a poetical composition also in his praise—when one of Ya’ktib’s servants  remarked, ‘‘ This importunate fellow fancies no doubt that we owe him some-  ‘* thing, and he comes to be paid.” To which the Amir replied, ‘‘ Let him come ;  ** that only proves that the first visit he paid us was to him an agreeable one, and  “that he thinks well of us; I would not consent, for all the riches in this world,  “that he should alter the favourable opinion he has conceived of us.” Upon  which he gave orders for the admission of the poet, whom he treated kindly, and  after hearing his verses rewarded him with the same sum as before.

State of science in Andalus—Passion for books—Education—Ethics and Metaphysics—Rhetoric and  Grammar—Language—Hand-writing—Story tellers—Quickness at repartee—Memory—Their love of  science—Their talent for poetry—natural in children—Jewish and Christian Poets.    Respectine the state of science among the Andalusians, we must own in justice state of  that the people of that country were the most ardent lovers of knowledge, as well “""*  as those who best knew how to appreciate and distinguish a learned man and an  ignorant one ; indeed science was so much esteemed by them that whoever had not  been endowed by God with the necessary qualifications to acquire it did every thing  in his power to distinguish himself, and conceal from the people his want of  instruction ; for an ignorant man was at all times looked upon as an object of  the greatest contempt, while the learned man, on the contrary, was not only  respected by all, nobles and plebeians, but was trusted and consulted on every  occasion ; his name was in every mouth, his power and influence had no limits,  and he was preferred and distinguished in all the occasions of life.   Owing to this, rich men in Cordova, however illiterate they might be, encouraged  letters, rewarded with the greatest munificence writers and poets, and spared neither  trouble nor expense in forming large collections of books ; so that, independently  of the famous library founded by the Khalif Al-hakem, and which is said by  writers worthy of credit to have contained no less than four hundred thousand  volumes,’ there were in the capital many other libraries in the hands of wealthy  individuals, where the studious could dive into the fathomless sea of knowledge,  and bring up its inestimable pearls. Cordova was indeed in the opinion of every  author the city in Andalus where most books were to be found, and its in-  habitants were renowned for their passion for forming libraries. ‘‘To such an  “extent did this rage for collection increase,” says Ibnu Sa’id, ‘‘ that any man in  “ power, or holding a situation under government, considered himself obliged to  “have a library of his own, and would spare no trouble or expense in collecting",193,book_2,chapter_3
"    Education.    140 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    “books, merely in order that people might say,—Such a one has a very fine  “library, or he possesses a unique copy of such a book, or he has a copy of such  “a work in the hand-writing of such a one.” Of this passion for books Al-  hadhrami has recorded the following instance :—‘‘ I resided once in Cordova for  “ some time, when I used to attend the book-market every day, in hopes of meeting  “‘ with a certain work which I was very anxious to procure. This I had done for  ‘* a considerable time, when on a certain day I happened to find the object of my  ‘* search, a beautiful copy, elegantly written, and illustrated with a very fine com-  “‘mentary. I immediately bid for it, and went on increasing my bidding, but, to  “ my great disappointment, I was always outbid by the crier, although the price was  “ far superior to the value of the book. Surprised at this, I went to the crier,? and  “ asked him to show me the individual who had thus outbid me for the book to  ‘‘a sum far beyond its real value, when he pointed out to me a man, who by his  ‘« dress appeared to be a person of high rank, and to whom on approaching I said,  ‘« « May God exalt his worship the Doctor! If thou art desirous of this book I  “will relinquish it, for through our mutual biddings its price has risen far above-  ‘its real value.’ He replied, ‘I am no Doctor, neither do I know what the  “contents of the book are; but I am anxious to complete a library which I am  “* forming, and which will give me repute among the chiefs of the city; and as  “‘ there happens to be still a vacant place capable of holding this book, I thought  “*T might as well bid for it: besides, it seems to be neatly written, handsomely  “ bound, and in very good condition ; it pleases me, and therefore I do not care  “ how high I bid for it, for, God be praised, my means are not scanty !’—When  “T heard this,” says Al-hadhrami, ‘‘I was so much vexed that I could not help  ‘ replying to him, ‘ Well, thou art right, means are never abundant except with  “men like thee; and as the proverb says,—he gets the nut who has no teeth.>  ‘“‘T, who am acquainted with the contents of this book, and who know how to  “‘ appreciate its merits, am deterred from buying it, and profiting by it, through  «the scantiness of my means, whilst thou, to whom the acquisition of it is a  “matter of perfect indifference, art abundantly provided with money to -pur-  “ chase it.’.”   Notwithstanding the proficiency of the Andalusians in all the departments of  science, we are informed that there were no colleges in that country where the  youth might be educated and inspired with the love of science, as is the case in the  East ; there seem to have been instead several professorships attached to every  mosque, and numerous professors who delivered lectures on various subjects for a  fixed salary which they received ; and had it not been so, science could not have  flourished as it did, for learned men among them laboured with all their might in the",194,book_2,chapter_3
"    CHAP. II1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 141    acquisition of knowledge, disregarding every other consideration or occupation  » from which they might have derived emolument : this is the reason why Andalus  produced so many authors who reached the highest degree of superiority and  eminence in the several walks of science, as we shall have occasion to prove  when we review their literature. At present it will suffice to say that the  Andalusians left luminous tracks in every department of science, which they  cultivated with an ardour and success unparalleled among other nations, with the  exception, however, of natural philosophy and astrology, two sciences which,  although secretly cultivated by the higher classes, were never taught in public,  owing to the prejudices of the multitude against them ; for if a man of the lower  classes were to hear another say, “Such a one gives lectures on natural philo-  sophy, or is working on astrology,” he would immediately call him zindtk,* (that is,  heretic,) and the appellation might, perhaps, remain attached to the learned man’s  name during the whole of his life: even the length of this might in some measure  depend upon his prudence or his management ; since the lower classes being once  ill-disposed and prejudiced against him, they would, on ‘the least provocation, pelt  him in the streets or burn his house down, before the head of the state had even  been made acquainted with the offence. Sometimes the Khalif himself, in order to ~  conciliate the good will and affection of his subjects, would order the poor man  to be put to death, and a scrupulous search to be made throughout his dominions,  when all: works on the obnoxious sciences perished in the flames. This is even  asserted to have been one of the means employed by Al-mansir to gain popularity  with the lower classes during the first years of his usurpation, although, if we are to  believe Al-hijéri, he was himself an adept in those sciences, and worked at them  secretly. But of this more will be said in the course of our work.   The reading of the Kordn according to the seven different schools was, together Theology.  with the science of sacred tradition, held in the greatest esteem by the Andalusians ;  the professions ‘of law and theology were likewise much honoured and distinguished.  As to their sect, they followed at first that of Al-auzd’ei, as we have remarked  elsewhere ; but in the course of time they adopted that of Malik Ibn Ans, and  knew no other, this being considered the orthodox profession in the state. How-  ever, we read in the historians of the times that people of rank or learning occa-  sionally followed one of the others, and went so far as to dispute about their  respective merits in the presence of their sovereigns, whenever these were endowed  with the necessary penetration, tolerance, and love for the sciences.

Faquih in the West was, and is even to the present day, considered as honourable  as that of Kédi in the East. So it was that Kétibs, grammarians, and rhetoricians  were generally honoured with that distinctive title, although they might not have  gone through their degrees in the law; for, we repeat, the title of Faquih was the  highest and most honourable that could be given to any man learned in grammar,  rhetoric, metaphysics, theology, or jurisprudence.   Divinity and ethics were always cultivated with tolerable success, but grammar  and rhetoric were carried to the highest perfection amongst them. ‘So great is  “the ardour of the Andalusians in the cultivation of these two sciences,” says  Ibnu Sa’id, “and so vast their attainments, that I do not hesitate to say that  “ there are at present, in this country, authors equal in merit and parts to the most  “famous grammarians and rhetoricians in the times of Khalil® and Sibauyeh,®  ‘‘ who have written works that will pass to future generations, and withstand the  ‘“‘ plows of the destructive scythe of time. The various systems or schools into  ‘“‘ which the science of grammar has been divided are by them preserved with the  “ greatest care, and with as much attention as the different schools of divinity and  “« jurisprudence are kept in the East. So, every literary man, whatever may be the  “ nature of his studies, must needs be a grammarian in order that he may pene-  “ trate the subtilties of the language, and appreciate the merits of good. composi-  ‘tion ; for, if he be not perfectly conversant with all the rules of grammar, it will  “be in vain for him to- seek distinction; he will never rise in the opinion of the  “Jearned, whatever may be his proficiency in other branches of learning, unless he  “ be well acquainted with that one ; and he will be, besides, continually exposed to  “ the venomous shafts of criticism.   “The Moslem inhabitants of Andalus being either Arabs or Mista’rabs,’ their  “ language, as may well be inferred, was no other than Arabic. However, it  “cannot be said but that the common speech, both among the higher and the  “* lower classes, has considerably deviated from the rules of the Arabic grammar ;  “so that were an eastern Arab to hear the prince of our grammarians, Shalibin,  ‘* engaged in conversation with another man, he would never believe him to be the  “author so much consulted and valued in this country, and whose works are  “ circulated and read both in the East and West ; and were he to attend one of his  “lectures he would undoubtedly burst out laughing to hear the blunders he  “ makes in speaking. It is true that people of high rank will occasionally observe  ‘‘ the grammatical rules in their speech, especially if conversing with Arabs newly  “ arrived from the East, but, instead of being natural, their speech then sounds  “heavy and affected.

Tbnu Sa’id, treating on the  subject, says, ‘The Andalusian hand,® which originated in the East, is in my  “opinion without a rival in point of elegance and distinctness,? and, if I may  “judge of the ancient writing by such specimens as I saw of it in the Korén  “written by Ibn Ghatttis, which was preserved in a city in the eastern part of  “ Andalus, and in other ancient copies of the Korn referred to by the learned of  “that country as specimens, it is a very handsome and clear hand, and what I saw  “was executed in a style which did much honour to the patience and dexterity of  “ the scribes.” ‘   We find, likewise, that the Khalifs and other principal citizens of Cordova were Story teller.  excessively fond of listening to pleasant tales and entertaining stories, and that the  art of learning these, and reciting them in public, was considered a great accom-  plishment among literary men, who were thus enabled to approach the presence of  the Sultén, and by their wit and their humorous sallies insinuate themselves into  his good graces. This was, indeed, considered to be so important a requisite, that  whoever was not acquainted with a sufficient stock of entertaining tales, to recite at  pleasure, was held in little estimation, and even despised in certain literary circles.  Tbnu-1-khattib tells us in his history of Granada of a certain Abi-l-hasan ’Ali Ibn  Abi-l-halyi-l-ken4ni, who was a very facetious man, and knew by heart a prodigious  number of stories and amusing anecdotes, which he used to repeat to his friends ;  his life had been one of continual adventure, and they say that he had gone through  wonderful chances and changes of fortune. The stories told by this man were put  down in writing by some studious men, and collected in one book, under the  title of Kitdbu-l-mesdleki wa-l-mahdlli ft akhbdri-bni Abt-l-halyi'® (the book of  routes and stations in the adventures of Abi-l-halyi). Abi-l-halyi died in 406 of  the Hijra (a.p. 1015-16).   The Andalusians have been justly celebrated for the quickness of their answers, Quickness at  and that facility of repartee which puts a stop to further reply; in them wit, oun  humour, acuteness of mind, and talents for poetry, seemed to be almost innate, so  that it was not an uncommon thing to see among them uneducated youth, and even  children, display those talents in a greater degree than grown up men trained in the  peths of learning.

"    Memory.    144 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    the K4di Abi-l-hasan Mukhtér Ar-ro’ayni,"""" who was renowned for his wit and great  eloquence, happened once to be summoned to the presence of his sovereign, Zohayr  the Sclavonian, king of Almeria, who, being then occupied in administering  justice in the hall of his palace, wanted to hear his opinion in a certain legal case.  When Ar-ro’ayni received the summons, he hastened to obey it, and began to  walk towards the palace, although at a very slow pace, and in the grave and stately  manner generally used by K4dis. Zohayr’s messenger, who went by his side,  and who knew how impatient his master would be, advised him to make haste,  and quicken his pace, but Ar-ro’ayni, disregarding his injunctions, continued to  proceed at the same slow rate, so that a considerable time passed before he reached  the Sultén’s palace. ‘‘ What ails thee, that thou hast tarried so long, O Ar-  ro’ayni ?” said Zohayr to him on his entering the audience-chamber. The Kadi  answered nought, but retracing his steps, and going back towards the door, he  there took a stick from the hands of an attendant, and lifting up with one hand  the lower part of his garment, he assumed the air and put himself in the position of  a man who is going to run. ‘ What is the meaning of all that?” said the Sultan,  astonished. ‘This means,” answered Ar-ro’ayni, “that I am going to take  “ possession of my new office, for as I was coming to thee, seeing that this thy  “usher urged me to quicken my pace, and make haste, it occurred to me that I  “might have been deprived of my place of Kadi, and appointed instead to be a  “ soldier in thy body-guard ;”'* upon which Zohayr burst into a hearty laugh,  and from that moment he never afterwards reprimanded him for coming too late.   As Az-zahri,'* a famous preacher in Seville, who was lame of one foot, was on a  certain evening walking with a son of his, a youth, on the banks of the Guadal-  quivir, he saw a party of young men coming down the river in a boat, frolicking  ‘and singing. It was then near the Passover, the time when our dogmas prescribe  to us to sacrifice victims and distribute their flesh to the poor, and among our  friends and relations. As the boat was passing Az-zahri, one of the party shouted  to him, ‘ How much for that lamb of thine?” meaning his son,—and Az-zahri  answered immediately, ‘‘ He is not for sale.” ‘‘ Well, then,” replied another,  ‘‘ what is the price of the old ram?” meaning the father; upon which Az-zahri,  without being at all disconcerted, raised his lame foot in the air, and said, ‘‘ Dost  “thou not perceive that the animal is lame, and therefore unfit for sacrifice ?”  —hearing which the whole party in the boat burst into a laugh, and were im-  pressed with admiration at the Sheikh’s ready wit and good temper.

"    CHAP. 111.) DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 145    Abi-l-mutawakel'® Al-haytham Ibn Ahmed Ibn Ghalib seems to have been the  phoenix of his age in memory, a real prodigy in learning by heart both prose  and verse. Ibnu Sa’id and his father Abi ’Omran, who knew him, bear ample  testimony of his extraordinary faculties. We shall let them speak: ‘I was once  “told,” says Abi ""Omran Misa Ibn Sa’id, “‘ by a trustworthy person, who was  ‘* present with him at an entertainment, what I am going to relate. ‘I was once  ‘« invited with other friends to the house of a rich citizen in Seville, where Abi-l-  “ mutawakel was one of the party; the conversation having turned upon his  “ extraordinary powers of memory, Abi-l-mutawakel kindly volunteered to exhibit  “ them before the company, and proposed to do any thing that was suggested to  ‘‘him. Then one of those present said, ‘In the name of Allah, we wish thee to  “* tell us traditions from authenticated sources.’ ‘Very well,’ said he, ‘let any  ‘* one of you choose the rhyme, and I promise not to stop until you are all tired.’  “ Upon which, one of the company having fixed upon the letter kaf, he began  “ to recite traditions ending with a rhyme in the said letter ; and, although it was  “early in the evening when he began, he continued throughout the whole night,  “and did not stop until the morning.’   “Some time after this occurrence, I happened,” continues Abi ’Omraén Ibn  Sa’id, ‘‘ to meet him at the house called Dédru-l-ashrdf (the house of the Sherifs),  “in Seville. When I entered the room, the company were occupied in reading  ‘various works, and among others the collection of poems by Dhi-r-rommah ;'*  “ Al-haytham, who sat by the side of one of the individuals who was reading  “aloud to the others, went up to him and tried to snatch the book out of his  “hands; the reader, however, grasped it with both hands, so that Al-haytham  ‘was unable to accomplish his purpose. Then turning round to me, he said, ‘O  “ Abd ""Omran ! is it just that this man should deprive us of a book of which he  “does not know one single verse by heart, and that he should keep it from me who  “can repeat every line it contains ?? When the company heard this they were much  “ surprised ; for, although they all knew Al-haytham’s extraordinary powers, yet,  “ the book having been but recently published, so as scarcely to have afforded Al-  ‘‘ haytham sufficient time to read it, they all thought that he had said what was  “ untrue, and therefore proceeded to put him to the test, strongly suspecting that  “he could not recite at any length out of it. Al-haytham said immediately, ‘ Let  “one of you take up the book and follow me;’ upon which, he began to recite  “ verse after verse in a masterly style, without forgetting either a vowel or an  “accent, until he reached the middle of the book, when, night being far ad-  “« vanced, and all of us tired, we all at once besought him to stop, which he did,  “and gave him our testimonials that we had never witnessed or heard of such   VOL. 1. u",199,book_2,chapter_3

Al-haytham  ‘ died, no doubt, during the siege of Seville by the troops of Al-bdji ;!® for he once,  “when the city was closely besieged by the enemy, sallied out with the garrison,  “ and was never heard of afterwards.”   Another anecdote is related by Abi ""Omar At-talamanki.'’® ‘I once entered,”  says he, “ the city of Murcia, when the people flocked round me to hear me read the  “ work entitled ‘ Wonderful stories of authors and books.’® I said to them—Here  ‘‘ is the book, fetch a man that may read in it; and I opened the work ready for  “his arrival. Behold! what was my astonishment when I saw them returning  ‘‘ with a blind man, whose name was Ibn Sidah, who began to recite it from top  “to bottom. Astonished at what I saw, I asked, and was informed that, although  “a blind man, he was gifted with so prodigious a memory that he could repeat  ‘‘ whatever he had once heard, and that having on a former occasion listened to the  “ reading of the said work, he now knew it quite by heart. This extraordinary  “man, whose entire name was Abt-l-hasan ’Ali Ibn Ahmed Ibn Sidah,” was not  “« only blind from his birth, but he was also the son of a blind man; he died at the  “« age of sixty, in the year four hundred and one™ of the Hijra, and is well known  ‘< as the author of the Kitdbu-l-muhkami ft-l-loghati (the book of the foundations of  “ the language).””   The love of the Andalusians for science is sufficiently proved by the numberless  anecdotes with which their biographical dictionaries and literary records are known  to abound. Abd Bekr Ibnu-s-sdéyegh, better known by the surname of Ibn Béjeh,”  once entered the great mosque of Granada,” and found a grammarian surrounded  by several youths, who were listening to his lessons. When they saw him come in,  they all rose, and exclaimed, in high spirits, ‘‘ What does the Faquih carry? what  ‘* does he say? how will he show his love for science?” And Ibn Béjeh answered,  “What I carry with me is twelve thousand dinars, here they are under my arm :”  and he produced twelve beautiful rubies, each of which was valued at one  thousand dindrs. ‘‘ What I say is that, valuable as these jewels are, they are still  “‘ inferior in my eyes to twelve youths working as you are for the acquisition of  “the Arabic language. And my way of showing my love to science is by drawing",200,book_2,chapter_3
"    CHAP. III.) DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 147    “lots among you, and giving away the best of these rubies :” and he accordingly  proceeded to do it. The preceding anecdote is transcribed from the work of Abi  Hayy4n the grammarian.*   Al-mudhdhafer Ibn Al-afttas, King of Badajoz, was, according to the historian  Ibnu-l-abb4r, of all the monarchs of his time the one who showed the greatest love  for science, and who rewarded the labours of the learned with the most liberal hand.  So great was his knowledge in all the branches of literature, so universal his attain-  ments in the sciences, so ardent his love of all sorts of information, that notwith-  standing his reign was one of continual agitation and danger, owing to the turbulent  times in which he lived, he still found leisure successfully to cultivate all the  sciences, leaving behind him that immense work in fifty volumes which raised  the admiration of both Eastern and Western writers; and in the composition of  which Al-mudhdhafer spared neither trouble nor expense, having previously col-  lected a rich and extensive library for the purpose. His work, indeed, which in  the East is known by the title of Al-mudhdhafert,® from the name of its royal  author, treats on universal science, being a repository of art, science, history,  poetry, literature in general, proverbs, biographical information, and so forth. Al-  mudhdhafer died in the year four hundred and sixty of the Hijra (a. p. 1067-8), and  in the words of Ibnu Hayyédn and Ibnu Bessdm, two authors who have written an  account of his life, he surpassed all the kings of his time in science and in learning,  as well as in virtue and brilliant qualities. Our readers, moreover, must not be  surprised at this, or think that we exaggerate when we say that Al-mudhdhafer’s  work was composed of fifty volumes. No, it is a notorious fact, and were we to  judge by other very voluminous works which are in existence, we should say that  it was the fashion among the Andalusian authors to protract their works to an  enormous length. We can, without going any further, quote Ibnu Hayyan’s large  historical work called Al-matin,?” in sixty huge volumes, and the Kitdbu-l-asmd  (the book of nouns) by Ahmed Ibn Ibdn,® Séhibu-sh-shartah in Cordova, in  one hundred volumes. Ibn Ibén died in three hundred and eighty-two (a.p.  992-3) ; we have seen in Fez some volumes of his work. Another instance of this  extraordinary fecundity is recorded by Ibn Alisa’ regarding an author of the name  of Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Mu’ammar, a native of Malaga, who wrote a  Commentary on the Kitdbu-n-nabdt (book of plants) by Abi Honeyfah Ad-di-  nawari,” composed of sixty volumes. Ibn Alisa’, who knew him in five hundred  and twenty-four of the Hijra (a.p. 1129-30), reports him as being then one  hundred years old. We might likewise quote here the words of Ibnu Hayyén,  who positively asserts that at the death of Abi Mohammed Ibn Hazm, which  happened in four hundred and fifty-six (a.p. 1063-4), there were found in his",201,book_2,chapter_3
"    148 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    room no less than four hundred volumes of works on various subjects, such as  history, poetry, jurisprudence, theology, &c. And Ibnu Hayydn adds, on the  authority of Abi-l-fahl Ibn Hazm, a son of the deceased, that having calculated  the sheets of paper which were taken up by his works, he found them to be eighty  thousand. We could mention numeraus similar instances of the fecundity and  extent of Andalusian genius, but as this is a thing long since ascertained, and which  needs not our confirmation, we shall leave it for the present.

We shall  not, therefore, dwell upon it; but as their inventions and improvements in the  arts and sciences, and their discovery of new and untrodden paths in the regions  of literature, are generally allowed materially to have increased the sources of our  knowledge, we deem it in place to mention, in a few words, those illustrious men  to whose labours, talents, or perspicuity, the sciences are indebted for their  advance, and who are placed by their countrymen at the head of their respective  faculties.   Abi-l-’abbds Kasim Ibn Firnds,®° the physician, was the first who made glass out  of clay,*! and who established fabrics of it in Andalus. He passes also as the first  man who introduced into that country the famous treatise on prosody by Khalil,**  and who taught the science of music. He invented an instrument called al-minkdlah,  by means of which time was marked in music without having recourse to notes or  figures.** Among other very curious experiments which he made, one is his trying  to fly. He covered himself with feathers for the purpose, attached a couple of wings  to his body, and, getting on an eminence, flung himself down into the air, when,  according to the testimony of several trustworthy writers who witnessed the per-  formance, he flew to a considerable distance, as if he had been a bird, but in  alighting again on the place whence he had started his back was very much hurt,   “for not knowing that birds when they alight come down upon their tails, he forgot  to provide himself with one. Mémen Ibn Sa’id has said, in a verse alluding to  this extraordinary man,— :   ‘* He surpassed in velocity the flight of the ostrich, but he neglected to arm  “ his body with the strength of the vulture.” *   The same poet has said in allusion to a certain figure of heaven which this Ibn  Firnds, who was likewise a consummate astronomer, made in his house, and where  the spectators fancied they saw the clouds, the stars, and the lightning, and listened  to the terrific noise of thunder,—   ‘“« The heavens of Abt-l-késim ’Abbds, the learned, will deeply impress on  ‘‘ thy mind the extent of their perfection and beauty.",202,book_2,chapter_3
"    CHAP. LI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 149    “Thou shalt hear the thunder roar, lightning will cross thy sight: nay,  “ by Allah! the very firmament will shake to its foundations.   “ But do not go underneath (the house), lest thou shouldst feel inclined,  “* as I was, (seeing the deception,) to spit in the face of its creator.”* ,   The following verse is the composition of Ibn Firnds himself, who addressed it  to the Amir Mohammed.* .   “« T saw the Prince of the believers, Mohammed, and the flourishing star of  ‘* benevolence shone bright upon his countenance.”   To which Mimen replied, when he was told of it, ‘‘ Yes, thou art right, but it  “ vanished the very moment thou didst come near it ; thou hast made the face of  “the Khalif a field where the stars flourish ; ay, and a dung-hill too, for plants do  “ not thrive without manure.”   Abi ’Obeydah Moslem Ibn Ahmed,’” known by the surname of Sdhibu-l-kiblah,  because he always used to turn his face towards the East when he was saying his  prayers, was consummately skilled in the science of numbers, arithmetic, astrology,  jurisprudence, and the knowledge of traditions. But his principal skill was in  astronomy ; he was perfectly acquainted with the movement of the stars and other  heavenly bodies, and their influence on the body of man. He travelled to the  East, and performed his pilgrimage to Mekka, where he attended the lessons of  ’Ali Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz ; he also resided for some time in Cairo, where he learnt from  Al-muzani* and others.   Yahya Ibn Yahya, better known by the surname of Ibriu-s-saminah,* a native of  Cordova, was versed in arithinetic, astrology, rhetoric, prosody, jurisprudence,  traditions, history, scholastic controversy, and the meaning of verses; in all  which sciences he laboured with the greatest success. He also travelled through  the East, where he is said to have adopted and professed the religious opinions of  the Mo’tazelites.   Abi-l-k4sim Asbagh Ibnu-s-samh* excelled in the science of grammar, as well as  in geometry and medicine, upon which he wrote several valuable treatises. He also  composed various works on geometry, such as the Kitdbu-l-mad‘hali fi-l-hindasati  (a key to geometry), being a commentary on Euclid, another voluminous work on  the same subject, and two others on the Astrolabe; and astronomical tables  according to the doctrines of the Indian school, known by the name of Sind-  Hind.” ,   Abd-l-k4sim As-saffar*? was also a profound geometrician ; he was deeply versed  in the science of numbers and astronomy, and wrote, among other works, some  astronomical tables, which he composed according to the method of Sind-Hind, and  a treatise on the mode of constructing Astrolabes.",203,book_2,chapter_3

Abi-l-hakem ’Omar Al-karmdani,“* an inhabitant of Cordova, acquired great  celebrity in arithmetic and geometry. He travelled to the East, and resided for  some time in the city of Harran,** where he frequented the schools of the learned.  To him belongs the honour of having introduced into Andalus the epistles of the  As‘hdbu-s-safé (the sincere friends) .*7   Abi Moslem Ibn Khaldin,** one of the noblest citizens of Seville, obtained  great celebrity through his knowledge of geometry, astronomy, medicine, and  natural philosophy. He left a disciple, named Ibn Borghiith,*’ who inherited  his extensive knowledge in those sciences, and was, besides, very accomplished  in mathematics. Ibn Borghiith left also several disciples who profited by his  lessons ; among whom we may reckon Abi-l-hasan Mukhtar Ar-ro’ayni,” the  famous geometrician and astronomer, and ’Abdullah Ibn Ahmed, of Saragossa,  who gained himself a name in geometry, algebra, and astronomy.   Mohammed Al-leyth*' was commended for his knowledge in arithmetic, geo-  metry, and the motions of the planets.   Ibn Hayyi,5? of Cordova, wrote on geometry and astronomy. He left Andalus  in the year four hundred and forty-two of the Hijra, arrived in Egypt, where he  resided for some time, and proceeded thence to Yemen, where he gained the  intimacy of its sovereign, the Amir As-solayhi,** the same who rose in those  districts and proclaimed Al-mustanser the ’Obeydite. That rebel sent him on  an embassy to Baghdad, the court of the Khalif Al-kéyem-biamr-illahi, which he  duly fulfilled, returning to Yemen, where he died some time afterwards.   Tbnu-l-wakshi,* of Toledo, excelled in geometry and logic, as well as in the  construction of astronomical tables and several other branches of knowledge which  it would take us too long to enumerate.   The Hafedh Abi-l-walid Hishém Al-washki®* was the most learned man of his  time in geometry, in the opinions of the philosophers,** grammar, rhetoric, the  obscure meaning of verses, prosody, the writing of risdleh, the canon and civil law,  the functions of a secretary,°’ and other departments of science, so that, as the poet  has said,—   “‘ He had sufficient science to be thought accomplished in every department  “* of it.’”5* ’   The Wizir Abi-l-motref ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Shahid*? was profound in medicine   and the natural sciences. He wrote a work on the various simples created by God,",204,book_2,chapter_3
"    CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 151    and which are used as medicaments ; and such were his patience, activity, and  talents, that he knew perfectly well the properties of every one of the simples  mentioned in his book, its strength, the degree of heat or cold which it possessed,  and its application to the cure of various diseases. This eminent man entertained  the opinion that diseases could be more effectually checked by diet than by  medicine, and that when medicine became necessary, simples were far preferable  to compound medicaments, and when these latter were required, as few drugs as  possible ought to enter into their composition. As a physician, Abi-l-motref  surpassed all his contemporaries; he performed wonders in the cure of acute  diseases and chronic affections, administering, as. we have observed, as little  medicine as possible to his patients.   The science of botany was considerably advanced by the talents and exertions of  Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Ahmed, better known by the surname of Ibnu-l-beyttar,® and a  native of Malaga, who not only wrote numerous works in which he most scrupu-  lously and minutely described the plants already known, but examined and analyzed  many which had never been discovered before his time. Ibnu-l-beyttar died  suddenly at Damascus in the year four hundred and thirty-four of the Hijra  (a.p. 1042-3), and according to some his death was occasioned by poison, which  he sucked while analyzing a plant brought to him, which he had never before  seen.   The Andalusians may safely be pronounced to have been gifted by the Al-  mighty with those shining qualities necessary to make a good poet,—-quickness of  thought, great command of language, a fertile imagination, and an extensive know-  ledge of men and things. These qualities indeed were not confined to the Moslem  inhabitants of Andalus, but were also, as we shall have occasion to show hereafter,  shared by women, as well as infidels. We ought not to wonder therefore if poetry  among them has left such visible traces, especially when poets have been on all  occasions much regarded by their kings, who rewarded their merits with bounteous  gifts and large pensions. It was the custom in Andalus for the most eminent poets  at the courts of the various Sultans to appear before them at certain festivities, and  on other great occasions, there to recite poetical compositions in praise of the  sovereign: by these means poets rarely failed in drawing upon themselves the  munificence of the monarch, who would reward them according to their merit and  their rank, unless it happened that times were calamitous, and ignorance prevailed,  although the former was more common. Many are the poems recited on these  memorable occasions which to this day excite the admiration, and provoke the  envy, of eastern poets; and the works of Al-fath Ibn Khakdén, Abt-l-kdsim Ibn  Bashkiiwél, Ibnu Sa’id, and others, who have written the lives of Andalusian    Their talents  for poetry.",205,book_2,chapter_3

It is related of Al-merwani, Sultan of Andalus, that in a correspondence which  he had with Nazér, the ’Obeydite Sultan of Egypt, there passed between them some  angry words, when Nazér wrote to Al-merwéni a letter full of insults, to which the  Andalusian replied in these words: ‘‘ Thou hast reviled us because we are known  “* to thee; had we been acquainted with thee in the same manner, we might have  “* given a proper reply: farewell.” They say that Nazdér was extremely hurt by  the answer, and never afterwards sought to quarrel with Al-merwéni, who is said on  a previous occasion to have written to him the following distich :   “ Are we not the sons of Merwdn,—that favoured family upon whom  “‘ nature has poured her richest gifts, and whom fortune has loaded with her  “choicest favours ?   ‘“‘ Whenever a birth occurs in our family, is not the entire earth illumined  ‘with joy at the appearance of the new-born child; do not the pulpits  “ shake to the sound of the proclamation of his name? ” ©   It is said of Ibn Dhi-l-wizérateyn Abi ’A’mir Ibni-l-faraj,* who held the  appointment of Wizir to Ibnu Dhi-l-nin, King of Toledo, that feeling once in-  disposed he sent for a physician, who prescribed to him to drink old wine.  Knowing that one of the Sultan’s pages possessed some, very old and of excellent  quality, he took pen and paper and addressed him the following lines, ex-  tempore :   “ Send me some of that wine as sweet as thy love, and more transparent  “than the tears which fall down thy cheeks.   ‘Send me, O my son! some of that liquor, the soul’s own sister, that  “I may comfort with it my debilitated stomach. I am thy servant.” *   The Sultan of Valencia, Merwdn Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz,* was an excellent poet. The  following two verses are recorded as having been repeated extempore by him on  the event of his learning that he had been deposed from his kingdom, to make  room for a man his inferior in every respect.   ‘« No wonder that a man has been found to succeed me in the government  “of this kingdom. “Tis true the day will dawn for them (the subjects); but  “they will have no evening.   “ His light will be like that of the stars in heaven, which never begin to  “ glitter until the sun is quite gone down in the West.” ©   Of this Merwan the historian Ibn Dih’yah has recorded many sallies of wit,  among which the following is one. ‘‘I entered,” says he, ‘“‘ the Sultén’s apartment",206,book_2,chapter_3

I command thee to repeat the verses in which thou hast  “made allusion to me.”—‘‘ In the name of Him who has put me under thy  “ power,” replied the poet, ‘‘ excuse me, for never was harm intended against  “thee.” ‘‘ Speak out,” cried Al-mu’atassem impatiently. Then the poet repeated  with a submissive voice the following two verses :   “ T saw Adam in my dream, and I said to him, O father of mankind! men  “ generally agree   “That the Berbers are descended from thee. Yes, it is true, but none  “« dispute that Eve was at that time divorced from me.®   “These are my expressions, O Al-mu’atassem! but thou must hear now my  “reasons for uttering them. It is well known that Ibn Balkin, the Sultén  “of Granada, thirsts after my blood, and has of late spared no trouble to get  “at my person and sacrifice me to his unjust resentment. Since I have taken  “ refuge in thy dominions he has tried every means to circumvent and destroy me,  “and he has caused reports of all kinds to be brought to thy ears, in order that  “thou mightst be angry with me and order my death, and thus be the instrument  “ of his revenge, while all the responsibility of an unjust and tyrannical act would  “weigh upon thee.” ‘‘ Well, but tell me,” said the Sultan, ‘ those verses contain  “no personal invective against Ibn Balkin more than the opprobrium with which  “thou hast charged his race. I would swear thou saidst something else against  “ him.”—* So I did,” answered the poet immediately ; ‘‘ when I saw my oppressor  “ build himself a strong citadel within the precincts of Granada, I said—   ‘The son of Balkin has built himself a castle ; he has, like the silk-worm,  ‘ wrapped himself up in his silk ball.’”’ 7°  Al-mu’atassem then said to the poet, ‘“‘ If what thou tellest me be true I can  VOL.

However,  “* T leave to thy choice whether I am to treat thee kmdly, or to deliver thee into  “* the hands of thy enemy that he may revenge his outrage.” Khalf then imme-  diately replied with these two extempore verses :  “« Al-mu’atassem has given me to choose; but he knows well my inten-  “ tions.  ** Since he has uttered the word pardon, I have no doubt he intends to  ‘“‘ be generous, and protect me.” 7”   ‘By my soul!” exclaimed the Sult4n, “ thy wit is the wit of Ashittén. I  ‘* pronounce thee both safe and free.”” And from that moment Khalf lived at the  court of Al-mu’atassem, honoured and rewarded by his sovereign, until Al-mu’a-  tassem was deprived of his kingdom.’   As the poet Abi-l-kdésim As-sohayli was once sitting in his house in Malaga,  news was brought to him how his native place, the town of Sohayt in the neigh-  bourhood, had been attacked, plundered, and set on fire, and his friends and  relatives either killed or taken, by a troop of Christian marauders, who had made  a foray into the heart of the Moslem territory. No sooner did the intelligence  reach As-sohayli than he hired a horse and a man to take him to the spot ; and  when he arrived at Sohayl he alighted, and finding the place deserted he uttered  extempore the following verses :   ““O my country! where are thy chiefs amd elders gone? Where thy in-  ‘‘ habitants from whom I experienced so- much generosity ?   “To see thy deserted dwellings the sighing lover might doubt whether he  “is alive, for to his greeting no salutation is returned.   “‘ When I ask, no voice answers mine save the parting echoes; no sound  “ strikes the ears of the pining lover.   “ The dove, it is true, sings on the lofty trees, but his mournful intonations,  ‘* caused by the loss of his consort, melt the heart of the sensitive, and make  “the tears fall in copious streams.   “ O my home! how cruelly fate has acted with thee; since time, that never  “ forgives, has spared thee in the midst of general destruction.”   We have said elsewhere that the town of Sohayl was so called from the fact of  its being the only spot in Andalus from which the constellation called Canopus  could be seen.

So the girl was right when she gave that answer, since Seville is far  superior to Almeria in this respect.   Abi ’Amri Ibn Sdlim of Malaga says, ‘‘ I was one day sitting in my room, when  “all of a sudden I was assailed by a violent and irresistible desire of going to  “ Aljebbaneh.”* I therefore left my house and went in the direction of that place ;  “ but scarcely had I proceeded a few steps, it being summer-time, and the weather  “very hot, when I felt oppressed by the heat; and, changing my mind, I returned  “home. Still, when I reached my house, I could not help the temptation of going  “ out again ; but this time I bent my steps towards the mosque called Rdbitatu-l-  “ Ghobdr,”? where I met the preacher Abi Mohammed ’Abdu-l-wahhéb Ibn ’Ali  “ Al-mélaki, who on my approach said to me, ‘I have just this moment been  “ beseeching God that he should bring thee to my presence; and my prayer has  “been granted: God Almighty be praised for it!’ I then told him what had  “happened to me, and how I had been led by an invisible power to go out of my  “house. After this I sat by his side; and on his entreating me to recite him some  “ verses, I repeated the following of an Andalusian poet :   ‘ They stole from morning the colour of her cheeks; they borrowed from  ‘ the arak tree its slender and delicate form.   ‘ Innumerable jewels shone brightly on their bosoms; and they took the  ‘ glittering stars for a necklace.",209,book_2,chapter_3

Having run to his assistance,  ‘I found him in a swoon, and it was not until an hour had elapsed that he again  “* came to his senses : when he said to me, ‘ Excuse me, my son, for there are two  ‘* things in this world against which I have no strength, viz. the sight of a pretty  “ face, and the hearing of good poetry.’ ”   They say that Abt-l-hoseyn Suleyman Ibnu-t-tar4wah, the famous grammarian  and poet, from Almeria, sitting one day with some of his friends at an entertainment  at his own house, there happened to be close at his side one of his most intimate  friends, who, when his turn came to drink, begged to be excused, and motioned  away the jar in which the liquor was presented to him. IJbnu-t-tardwah then  taking the glass from him drank off its contents; and finding that it struck cold  on his liver he said extempore—   “« Let the Sheikh and his equals, and all those whose conduct is worthy of  “« praise, blame me for what I have done.  “This I know, that when the young camel finds her load too heavy she  “ throws *' it on the full grown one.”  Poetry an ins We have said elsewhere that children in Andalus not unfrequently exhibited  culden. natural talents, and a facility of rhyming, which could not often be met with in  people of mature age, or who had had the benefits of education. In proof of this  we shall quote the following anecdotes, related by their writers. Ibn Abi-]-khissdl  Ash-shektri (from Segura) having, when still a boy, repaired to the city of Ubeda,  in order to study in the schools of that place, lodged at the house of the K4di Ibn  Malik. Happening one day to go out with him to an orchard, Ibn Malik picked  a bunch of black grapes, and holding it in his hand he said to Ibn Abj-l-khissal,  “Look at these grapes hanging from the stalk.” ‘‘Yes,’’ answered Ibn Abi-l-  khissal, in rhyme, “ like the head of an Abyssinian slave.” ‘‘ Well said!” replied  his master, who from that moment prognosticated that Ibn Abi-l-khissal would be  an eloquent orator and a good poet.   It is related by Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Zarktin that Abi Bekr Ibnu-l-monkhol® and  Abt Bekr Al-mallah, both born at Silves, and dwelling in Salobrefia, a town  on the southern coast, not far from Almeria, were so much attached to each other  that they looked as if they were brothers. Each had a son, still young, but who had  shown from infancy the greatest aptitude for science, and the most vehement desire",210,book_2,chapter_3
"    CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 157    of learning, so much so that, although too young yet to have their abilities improved  by education, they had already given repeated proofs of their proficiency and talents  by gathering the spears of preference in the hippodromes of literature. These two  children were continually attacking each other with satirical remarks and witty  sayings, by which means their talents for versification were exercised and improved.  However, Ibnu-l-monkhol happening one day to ride out together with his son  Abi ’Abdillah, he began to reprimand him for his conduct towards his young  friend, and said, ‘‘ Thy continual jests and satirical traits against Ibnu-l-mallah  “« will, I have no doubt, damp the intimacy existing between me and his father, so  “‘ pray do not attack him any longer, lest I should lose through it my friend  “ Abi Bekr’s love.” ‘‘I cannot help it,” replied his son, “if it is so, for it is  “* always he who begins the fray, and I only use in my own defence the weapons  “ of satire. The offender is always wrong, and it is but just that he should bear all  “ the weight of evil who begins with it.”* When Al-monkhol heard this excuse  of his son, he could not help saying, ‘‘ Well, if the case between you stands as  “* stated by thee, I exculpate and justify thee.” While this conversation was thus  going on between father and son, behold! they came up to a large water-pool in  the middle of the road, where frogs innumerable were filling the air with their  croakings. ‘‘ Go on,” said Ibnu-l-monkhol to his son, “the frogs are croaking in  “that pool.” ‘ Yes,” replied his son, ‘and with no sweet melody, troth.”  “ Their language was boisterous,” said the father. ‘‘ When they called the Beni  “ Al-mallah,” answered the son. However, when they heard the footsteps of the  travellers the frogs became silent, and a pause ensued also in the dialogue  between father and son while crossing the pool. At last, Ibnu-l-monkhol said to  his son, ‘‘ Thou hast become mute like these frogs.” ‘‘ When they collected for  “scandal,” answered his son. ‘‘ There is no help for the oppressed,” said the  old man; “and no rain for those who want it,” was the son’s reply.®   Certainly nobody will doubt but that this finishing of hemistichs is highly  deserving of praise; had it been executed by a learned man advanced in life it  would have commanded the greatest attention, but being, as it was, the work of  a mere boy, it was a most wonderful performance, and well worthy of remark.   Nor were readiness of wit and poetical talents confined to the Moslems, for we Christan ond  find them existing among the Christias and Jews who inhabited Andalus, (may  the Almighty God restore it entirely to the hands of the true believers!) For  instance, a Christian named Al-maza’ri, a native of Seville, where he resided, is  said to have extemporized the following verses in the act of presenting the Sultan  Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbdd with a hunting bitch : 5",211,book_2,chapter_3
"    158 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    “ T never saw a better cause of pleasure for those that are fond of sport, nor   a surer source of profit for those who desire gain,   “ Than this animal full of excellent qualities ; her colour might throw into   the shade the brilliant hue of a yellow tunic:   “ Like a bow in her shape, and yet she darts on-her prey more straight than   an arrow.   “If thou try her scent, she will guide thee to secret haunts abounding with   game. ,   “« Nay, were she to challenge the lightning to a hunting match, she would  “ leave it far behind in the race.” ®   These verses, and others by the same author, are recorded in the Al-mas‘hab of  Al-hijéri, who has therein introduced the Christian’s biography.   The following verses are the composition of a Jew, of the name of Ibréhim Ibn  Sahl Al-israyili,®” who is reported to have pronounced them extempore on a slave  who was ill with the jaundice : .   “« Thou wast an honour to thy master until thou wast thus deprived of thy  “ beauty.   “For thou didst appear in the morning like a wax taper, which, when  “ extinguished, shows a black wick.’”®   There are various opinions entertained concerning this Jew ; some saying that he  was in heart a Moslem, others that he publicly embraced Isl4m, and professed it  till the day of his death, others again that he lived and died in the Jewish persuasion.  Abi Hayydn, the grammarian, relates, on the authority of the Kadi-l-kod4é Abi  Bekr Mohammed Ibn Abi Nasr Al-fat’h Al-kaysi, who had it from ’Alf the Christian,  a native and inhabitant of Seville, whom he chanced to meet in Granada in one of  his travels, that Ibrahim Ibn Sahl the poet was at first a Jew, but that towards the  end of. his life he was converted to Islam, and wrote in praise of Mohammed,  the messenger of the Lord, a long and elegant kassidah. ‘I read it once,” says  Abi Hayydn, “‘and I declare that in point of melody it is one of the most admirable  ‘* poems I ever read in my life.”   The same opinion is entertained by the Hafedh Abi ‘Abdillah Mohammed  Ibn ’Omar Ibn Rashid Al-fehri,® who in his great itinerary entitled “the filling  of the knapsack with information collected during a journey to the two holy  places, Mekka and Medina,” asserts positively that Ibn Sahl embraced Isl4m,  quoting as a proof an epistle written by ’Ali HAmish to the preacher and ulema  Sidi Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Marzik,” and which reads thus: ‘‘I have been in-  “formed by a contemporary, who was well acquainted with him, that Ibn    Ti    “    “",212,book_2,chapter_3
"    CHAP. I11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. : 159    “ Sahl died a Moslem.” The same author (Ibn Rashid) quotes the following  anecdote, which he says he read in a certain literary work in the West, and which  would tend to prove that Ibn Sahi was really a Moslem: Ibn Sahl once re-  ceived in his house a company of literary men, and, the conversation happening  to turn on his religion, one of the party ventured to ask him whether he was  really a Moslem in. heart, as he professed: to be, or only affected it, upon which  he is said to have answered—  “« For men are the things apparent, for God only what is concealed.” *  As a further proof of Ibn Sahl’s conversion, the following two verses. of his are  adduced :  “Fam content with Moses for the sake of Mohammed; I am now in the  “ right path, but had it not been for Allah I should never have been directed.  “* What has made me change my mind is this, that I saw the law of Moses  “‘ was wanting in a Mohammed.” *   However, as we have already stated’, there are not wanting authors who assert  that Ibn Sahl’s conversion was a feigned one, and that he never abandoned the  Jewish creed. Ar-ré’ii® (may God show him mercy!) says, ‘‘ I was told by the  “ Sheikh Abi-l-hasan ’Ali Ibn Sama’t Al-andalusi,—‘ there are two things in this  “world to which I give no faith,—one is the conversion of Ibn Sahl, the other  “ Az-zamakhshari’s repentance for having joined the Mo’tazelites.’ But,” observes  Ar-ré’ii, ‘‘ I have better authority not to coincide in this author’s opinions: as to  “Tbn Sahl’s conversion, because, according to all received opinions on the subject,  “ Tam inclined to believe it was a sincere one ; and as to Az-zamakhshari’s repentance  “from the heresy. of the Mo’tazelites, because I myself saw in the East a legal  “ document stating that Az-zamakhshari™ had abjured the religious errors of that  “ sect.”   Al-’azz,® who wrote Ibn Sahl’s life, inclines to the contrary opinion, and thinks  that there are sufficient proofs to believe he was a Moslem ; but God only knows  the truth of the case. One thing however is certain, namely, that Ibn Sahl was  ene of the best poets of his time, as the collection of his poems sufficiently testifies.  He lived at Seville, where he was one of the elders of his tribe, and attended the  lessons of Abi ’Ali Ash-shalibin, Ibnu-d-dabbaégh,” and others. They say that a  western Arab, having been once asked the cause why Ibn Sahl could write in so    tender a strain, gave the following answer—‘ Because he unites two humilities, the ©    humility of the lover and that of the Jew.”   According to Abi Hayy4n, Ibn Sahl perished in a sea voyage; the vessel in  which he was embarked meeting with a tempest he was drowned with all the rest  of the crew. This happened in the year six hundred and forty-nine, and Ibn",213,book_2,chapter_3

When the event became known in  Seville, another Jewish poet is said to have remarked very happily, alluding to  Tbn Sahl’s drowning, that ‘‘ the pearl had only returned to its shell.”   Tbréhim Tbnu-l-fakhkhér Al-yahtdi is another famous poet. He lived among  the Christians, and in the service of Alfonso, king of Toledo, with whom he rose  high in favour, so as to be appointed by him his ambassador to the court of  a Moslem Sultén in the West. In the opinion of all his contemporaries he was  an elegant prose writer, and a very good poet. Ibnu Sa’id, who mentions him, has  handed down to us some of his verses, among which are the following, which he  wrote in praise of his master Alfonso (may God annihilate him !)—   “ The court of Alfonso has always the appearance of a house prepared for  “ nuptials.   “ And the leaving of sandals at the door would persuade thee that thou  “ wast in Jerusalem.” ” .   The following anecdote is told of this Jew, who related it to the author from  whose writings we now borrow it. ‘I once went on a message from my master  “to the Khalif Al-mustanser,® and when I went to present my credentials to the  “ Wizir I found him sitting in one of the gardens of the palace, a charming spot,  “‘of the greatest beauty and luxuriance, resembling in every respect a paradise,  “ only that the gate-keeper was the ugliest and most disgusting creature I had ever  “seen in my life. When the Wizir asked me afterwards what I thought of the  “« garden, I said to him, ‘I would undoubtedly compare it to paradise, were it not  ‘‘ for one circumstance, which is that its gate, I am told, is guarded by Redwén,  “ and here I see Malik.’ The Wizir laughed heartily, and proceeded to acquaint the  “ Khalif with my answer. He then brought me the following reply,—‘ Tell the  “ Jew that such was my intention in choosing my gate-keeper; for had he been  “ Redwan, he would undoubtedly have sent him back, saying—Go away, this is  “ pot a place for those of thy religion to enter ;—while Malik, not knowing what is  “behind him, and thinking he keeps the gate of hell, allowed him to pass without  ‘resistance.’ When the Wizir communicated to me the Sultdn’s answer,” con-  tinues the Jew, “I could not refrain from saying, ‘ Well, God only knows who  “‘ those are who will enter paradise.’” ,   “Another famous Jew, whose name was Elias Ibn Al-mudawwar, a native of Ronda,  is mentioned by various historians ; he was an eminent physician, and a good poet.  The following two verses, which he addressed to another Jew, are much commended.  The occasion of his writing them was as follows. There was in the same city of  Ronda where Elias practised medicine another eminent Jewish physician, and, as  is often the case among people of the same profession, they were jealous of each",214,book_2,chapter_3
"    CHAP. 111.) DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 161    other, and were continually disputing and quarrelling. Their common friends often  interposed, and, by becoming the mediators in their quarrels, succeeded in making  them friends ; but at the first opportunity they broke out again, and the whole city  of Ronda was made the scene of their squabbles. At last, Elias having become, by  some means or other, the master of a certain secret concerning his antagonist,  which might, if made public, seriously affect his reputation as a physician, and  prevent the people from employing him, he wrote to his rival the following distich :  “Do not blame me (if I accuse thee), and let my excuse be the rivalry  “ which ought to exist between people of the same profession.  “ Look at the sun and moon when they illumine our globe; from their  “constant labours and rival courses light is produced :””  meaning, as they were both labouring to diffuse the rays of science, it was  necessary that there should exist between them mutual jealousy and division, in  order that through their mutual efforts to surpass one another, and by their pur-  suing different courses, the cause of science might be benefited ;—in the same  manner as the sun and moon, by following opposite roads, illumine the world:  the moon shining at night, and the sun by day-time; but the eclipse being  produced the moment they tried to approach each other.   A Jewish poetess, named Kasmunah, daughter of Isma’il the Jew, is also counted  among the bright geniuses of that nation. Her father, who was himself a man of  considerable learning and a good poet, had bestowed the greatest care on her  education, and imparted to her all the science which he himself possessed. He  used to compose part of an ode and then give it to her to finish. He once said to  her,—‘‘ Tell me who is   ‘“« The master of beauty, who fights and vanquishes those who oppose him,  “ and yet whose trespasses are excused ?”  And she replied, almost immediately,  “The sun, which imparts its light to the minor constellations, and whose  “ face after this appears quite dark.” '   But having proceeded so far in our endeavours to prove the aptitude and talents  of the Andalusians for poetry, we should be guilty of negligence if, before termi-  nating this chapter, we did not say a few words about the wives and daughters of  the Moslems who made themselves conspicuous by their talents, and who showed  their wit and eloquence in elaborate and ingenious poems.

Among the numerous poetical compositions which we find  ascribed to her the following distich deserves particular mention :  “ Men generally court the friendship of strangers, and avoid any intercourse  “ with their own relations ;  “ For relatives are like scorpions, or worse than they.”   The Khattib Ibn Marztk, by whom this distich has been preserved, attributes  it to the above-mentioned poetess ; we have seen it quoted elsewhere as the com-  position of Ibn ?Omayd. But God only is all-knowing.   Hasanah Al-yatimah, daughter of Abi-l-hoseyn the poet, and Ummv-l-’olA,  daughter of Yiisuf, were also two famous poetesses. The latter is mentioned by  the author of the Al-mugh’rab, who speaks of her as a native of Guadalaxara, and  as having flourished in the sixth century of the Hijra. Some of her verses may  be seen in the said work.   Ummatu-l-’aziz Ash-sherifiyyah was, as her name sufficiently indicates, of the  posterity of Hasan, son of ’Ali Ibn Abi Talib. The Héfedh Abi-l-khattéb Ibn  Dih’yah, who was a descendant of hers, has preserved to us in his Kitdbu-l-muttreb  min ash’dri-l-maghreb*® (the book exhibiting songs extracted from the works of  western poets), some of her verses, which are sufficient to rank her among the  eminent poets of her time.   Al-ghosdniyyah,'’™ a native of Bejénah, a considerable and famous district in the  province of Almeria, is likewise counted among the poets who flourished in the fifth  century of the Hijra.   Al-’aridhiyyah,'’® a freed slave-girl belonging to Abi-l-mutref ’Abdu-r-rahman  Ibn Ghalbiin the Katib, was another distinguished female. She lived at Valencia,  where she was taught by her master grammar and rhetoric, in both which branches  of knowledge she soon made such progress as to surpass her teacher. She also  shone in prosody, and learnt by heart and wrote commentaries on the Al-kdmil of  Al-mubarrad, and on the An-nawddir of Al-kéli. Abdi Détd Suleymén Ibn  Najah says, “I read under her direction the two above-mentioned commentaries,  “ and learnt from her the science of prosody. She died at Denia, some time after  “her master’s death, in the year four hundred and fifty of the Hijra, or there-  “ abouts.” (May God show her mercy !)   Hafsah ’Ar-rakiniyyah, daughter of Al-hdji Ar-rakini, was equally renowned for  her beauty, her talents, her nobility, and her wealth. A notice of this famous poetess,  as well as a selection from her verses, occurs in the work of Al-maléhi. The  following, which she is said to have uttered extempore in the presence of the  Prince of the believers ’Abdu-l-mimen Ibn ’Ali when about asking him for a  favour, are justly commended :",216,book_2,chapter_3
"    CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 163    ‘** O master of men! O thou whose gracious favours the people anxiously  “ and confidently expect !  “« Grant me a diploma, which may be a promise to thy subjects ;  “* One upon which thy right hand has traced—‘ Praise be to God, the only  “ one.’ 7? 106  The poetess here alludes to certain signs of royalty introduced by the Sultans of  the dynasty called Al-muwdhedtin (Almohades), and which consisted in writing at  the top of their dispatches, with a thick pen and in very large characters, ‘“‘ Praise  “* be to God, the only one.”   With this Hafsah the Wizir Abi Ja’far Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-l-mélik Ibn Sa’id  Al-’ansi'”” lived on terms of the greatest friendship and intimacy. They were  continually addressing to each other epistles and verses, and their mutual answers  can only be compared to the language of doves. We learn from Abi-l-hasan  ’Ali Ibn Misa Ibn Sa’id, the author of the Al-mugh’rab,—a work to which we own  ourselves very much indebted for our information,—and who was the descendant  of this Abi Ja’far, that he heard his father say, ‘‘ I know not among the Beni  “« Sa’id of any poet like him ; or rather, I know not among my countrymen of any  “who ever surpassed Abi Ja’far in poetical composition.” Some account of this  noble Wizir, extracted from the work of his descendant Ibnu Sa’id, will not, we  hope, be deemed superfluous.   Abi Ja’far was the son of ’Abdu-l-m4lik Ibn Sa’id, Lord of Kal’at-Yahseb, a  place not far from Granada, and the scene of the adventure which we have related  in a former part of this book as having happened to the famous poet and historian  Tbnu-l-hijari. At the arrival of the Beni ’Abdi-l-mimen in Andalus, ’Abdu-l-milik,  who had embraced the opposite party (that of the Almoravides), took an active  part in the contest, and managed to maintain himself independent in his little  dominions. His son, Abi Ja’far, he appointed to be his Nayib or lieutenant, that  he might aid him in the perilous duties of the administration, and in the defence  of his state. However, Abi Ja’far, who knew how to handle the pen better than  the sword, soon perceived his own inability to meet the exigencies of the charge,  and begged his father to exonerate him from it and appoint another in his stead.  This request ’Abdu-l-mélik refused to grant, but his son, not being able to bear  any longer the important duties attached to his situation, deserted him, and left  public affairs in order to enter into private life, after having written to his father a  beautiful epistle in verse, in which he expatiated at full length upon the comforts  and advantages of private life. They say that when ’Abdu-l-mélik read his son’s  epistle, he exclaimed, ‘“‘ Well, I shall not go against his will, for God Almighty  “ does not permit that men should succeed in things for which they feel no inclina-",217,book_2,chapter_3
"    164 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    “tion.” After this he wrote on the back of the letter, ‘‘ We send thee our  “ benediction, and grant thee permission and full liberty to occupy thyself in such  ‘* pursuits as answer best thy inclination.”   *Abdu-l-malik could not long maintain his independence ; all the Andalusian  chiefs having submitted to the Beni ’Abdi-l-mimen, he was himself constrained to  acknowledge them as masters, and tender the oath of allegiance, owing to which  he not only retained the government of Kal’at-Yahseb, but rose high in favour  with the Sultans of that dynasty. In the meanwhile Abi Sa’id Ibn ’Abdi-l-  miimen was appointed to be governor of Granada, and being in want of a secretary  he began to inquire among the inhabitants for a person fit for the place. He was  told that Abi Ja’far was the man most suitable, from his learning, his talents, and  ability, to discharge the duties of Katib; he accordingly sent for him and declared  to him his intention to invest him with that charge. Abt Ja’far refused, as he  had done on a previous occasion, and begged to be left in private life, but on Abi  Sa’id insisting strongly he was compelled to accept it. However, he did not  exercise his functions long. As he was one day entertaining a party of friends at  his house, the conversation, amidst wine and mirth, turned upon hunting, a pastime  of which Abi Ja’far was passionately fond ; a party was accordingly arranged for  the next day, and, having provided themselves with all necessaries, Abi Ja’far and  his friends started on their expedition. It happened to be a very cold and cloudy  day, and, the cold increasing, the hunters thought fit to shelter themselves in the  hut of a watchman who was guarding vines.’ They lighted a good fire, dressed  some of their game, and began to eat with good appetite, and drink abundantly  after it. Abi Ja’far especially helped himself to so much liquor that he was quite  intoxicated, and putting aside all reserve he began to divulge the secrets of his  heart, and to describe the pleasures he had enjoyed that day in the following  eloquent strain :   “This has been a day spent in pleasure and sport; a day in which the  ‘* atmosphere shone brightly, charged with the amber of the clouds ;—   “* A day which (after contributing to our amusement) left us enough evening  “and sufficient wine to induce us to spend it in the midst of revelling and  “ mirth.   ** After riding and sporting all the morning we perceived that the day was  “ not entirely gone, and yet we were all fatigued and broken down by the  “ jolting trot of our steeds.   “‘ Our sport too had been abundant, for with grey-coloured hawks we chased  “and brought down numerous birds, whose death our pleasures required,  “ although their throats might lament under the knife.",218,book_2,chapter_3
"    CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 165    “« So when the last rays of the sun ‘began to spread a deep red tint over the  “ horizon, and the fight between obscurity and light commenced, victory  “ hanging for some time uncertain,—when every man and beast belonging to  ‘‘ our party had been assembled,—   “‘ Wishing to give our empty stomachs a share in the spoil, and to begin   afterwards a new chase of mirth and pleasure,—the cold, too, increasing and   “ becoming more and more piercing,—   “We bent our steps to the hut of a watchman, placed in the centre of a   vineyard and surrounded by its sweetness, and provided with a blazing fire,   which proved our salvation from the rigour of the weather.   “‘ 1 gave him a gold piece, and told him,—Go to the neighbouring village   “ and buy us provisions, heed not the price,   ‘* And say to the seller that thou hast seen me tied down in the service of   my master, more cruelly than the bird in the cage of the fowler.   “ And yet I only follow my inclination. Do I look like one who is subject  “to a Lord? do I look like one who is deprived of liberty ?” !   There happened to be among the company a man who, although he professed to  be Abii Ja’far’s friend, was, nevertheless, his secret enemy, and who, learning by  heart the last two verses, went the next day to the governor and repeated them to  him. Abd Sa’id immediately removed Abi Ja’far from his place, and conferred it  on another learned man. Things, however, did not stop there: Abd Ja’far having  once said to Hafsah the poetess, ‘‘ Do not love that black man, and I engage to buy  “thee ten better than he in the black slave-market,” meaning the governor, who  was of so dark a complexion as almost to resemble a negro, the words were again  reported to Abii Sa’id, who, however much he might have resented the outrage,  did not at first give vent to his passion, but concealed it in his heart, waiting  for a favourable opportunity. This, however, soon presented itself, for Abi  Ja’far’s brother, ’Abdu-r-rahman, son of ’Abdu-l-mdlik Ibn Sa’id, having taken  part with the rebels, and quitted Granada in order to join the troops under the  command of Ibn Mardanish, who had been proclaimed in the east of Andalus,  Abi Ja’far was arrested by the governor’s orders, thrown into a dungeon, and soon  afterwards beheaded at Malaga, then the place of his residence. But to return to  our account of the Andalusian poetesses.   Another poetess named Hafsah, daughter of Hamdtin, and a native of Guada-  laxara, is mentioned by Ibnu Sa’id among his illustrious characters of the fourth  century of the Hijra. She is also much praised by Ibnu-l-abbar, who sets her  down as a very clever poetess, and by Ibn Faraj, the author of the Al-haddyik'”  (orchards), who quotes some of her verses.    7",219,book_2,chapter_3
"    166 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK 11.    Zeynab Al-murabiyyah,"" and Hamdah, whom others call Hamdtinah, were the  daughters of Zeydd, a native of Guadix. They are mentioned by several authors,  as Al-malahi, Abi-l-k4sim, Al-bardk, and others. Ibnu Sa’id says that they were  born at Granada, but agrees with the former writers in fixing the city of Guadix as  their residence. Both were famous for their wit, their literary accomplishments,  and their talents for poetry. The former, especially, was deeply versed in various  branches of literature ; she wrote and copied many works, which, in the opinion of  Tbnu Sa’id, who says he saw some of them, were written in a masterly style.  Zeynab died in the year four hundred of the Hijra; she never would consent to be  married, although she had numerous proposals. She lived for some time at  Cordova, where she used to frequent the house of Al-mudhfer, son of Al-mansir Ibn  Abi ’A’mir, in whose praise she composed several verses.   Mariam,""? daughter of Abii Ya’kib Al-ansari, inhabited Seville, of which place she  was a native, although other writers say that the city of Silves was the place of her  birth. Ibn Dih’yah, who mentions her in his Al-muttreb, says that she was a learned  and very accomplished woman, and that she taught rhetoric, poetry, and literature,  which, united to her piety, her good morals, her virtues, and amiable disposition,  gained her the affection of her sex, and gave her many pupils; she lived to an old  age, and died after the year four hundred of the Hijra. Al-homaydi has likewise  given an account of this poetess, and quoted some of her verses.   Asma Al-’4meriyyah was also a native of Seville, where she resided and made  herself conspicuous among the learned by her talents. She addressed to ’Abdu-l-  mimen Ibn ’Ali a risdleh, in which, after stating minutely her genealogy, and her  claims to a descent from Ibn Abi ’A’mir, she proceeded to beg the favour of being  exempt from the payment of taxes, and having soldiers quartered upon her. There  was at the end of the risdleh an ode which began thus :   “O Prince of the believers! O our magnificent Lord! we wish thee  “« prosperity. May the Almighty give victory to thy arms!   ‘“‘ When we rise to the superior regions of tradition, thy name and thy acts  “are the surest path to them.” 15   Ummu-I-hiné, daughter of the Kadi Abi Mohammed ’Abdu-I-hakk Ibn ’Attiyyah,""""  learnt divinity from her father, and was, besides, an excellent poetess. She lived at  Almeria, and wrote several works on the mode of worshipping the Almighty.   Hind, a slave girl of Abi Mohammed ’Abdullah Ibn Moslemah Ash-shatebi (a  native of Xdtiva), is said to have excelled in poetry, music, and the lighter branches  of literature. It is related of Abi ’A’mir Ibn Yank,""® that wishing once to hear  Hind perform on the lute he addressed her in the following two verses, begging her  to come to his house :",220,book_2,chapter_3
"    CHAP.

All I know is  “that she was a very good poetess, as may be gathered from her writings, and  “especially from an epistle in verse which she addressed to the Sultén Ya’kib  “ Al-mansir, complaining of a certain governor and collector of taxes in the city  “ where she resided.”   Nazhiin ""° the Granadian is described by Ibnu Sa’id, who places her among the  illustrious characters of the fifth century. She is likewise mentioned by Al-hijari,  who portrays her in his Al-mas‘hab as a female endowed with great tenderness of  soul, and a very mild disposition; extraordinary talents for poetry, and a most  wonderful memory. She wrote several poems, and made herself famous by the  beauty and happiness of her similes.   Bahjah, a native of Cordova, and a friend of the famous Walddah, was equally  renowned for her beauty and for her verses. She lived in great intimacy with  Waladah,'* the daughter of Al-mustakfi, King of Cordova, and profited by her  lessons. But of this Wal4dah, who was herself the most eminent poetess of her  time, as well as of Ramikiyyah, Imad, Al-’abb4diyyah, and Buthinah, the three  former wives, and the latter a daughter, of Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbdd, King of  Seville, more will be said in the course of our. narrative.   Having clearly shown the aptitude and talents of the inhabitants of Andalus, we  shall now proceed in the next chapter to give, in the words of the historian Ibnu  Sa’id, as faithful a sketch as we can of the productions of Andalusian genius in  every department of science.",221,book_2,chapter_3

The epistle ran thus :   “*O our Lord! O thou most beloved among our intimate friends! may the  Almighty God write down for thee prosperity and happiness! may He continue  thee in power and command! may He help and assist thee, put thee in the right  path whenever thou askest for direction, and enlighten thee whenever thou wishest  “ to be instructed !   «The object of this our letter is that we some time ago began to think about  thy country, and to consider how it was the abode of every excellence, the store  of every good thing, the‘ resort of every novelty, and the meeting-place of every  advantage ; the end of the hopes of the desirous, and the scope of the wishes of  the inquiring; the great emporium of trade, where every merchandize found a  purchaser, and every buyer the object of his wishes.

By these means the coward became brave, the timid was  “‘ made bold,—the obscure, conspicuous,—the ignorant, learned,—the stammerer,  “ eloquent,—the inarticulate crier, a poet. The Bogdth' strove to imitate the eagle  “ in his flight, bats were enabled to see? by daylight, men gave their entire attention  “to the cultivation of science, and the arts flourished through the general efforts  “employed in them. All this we know to be true, but at the same time it must be  “ owned that your literary men are guilty of unpardonable negligence, and unac-  “ countable indolence, in perpetuating the records of their country ; since, instead of  “collecting the excellences and advantages of their respective towns,—instead of  “ perpetuating in their books the memory of their cities, and transmitting to posterity  “the actions of their Kings and Princes, Kétibs and Wizirs, Kddis and Ulemas,—  “ instead of leaving behind them accounts which might preserve for ever afterwards  “ the fame of their deeds, and eternize and renew their names through the lapse of  “ ages, and the course of nights and days,—instead of composing books which, like  “ the tongue of truth, might herald their virtues to future generations through the  “succession of time,—they leave every merit and virtue in the most complete state  “of oblivion. Yes, truth must be told ; although we admit that your learned men  “ shine like so many bright stars in the sciences, thou must own that every thing  “ belonging to them remains in the shade, does not come before the public, stands  “firm on its pivot, and never goes astray. If they write a book, they are afraid of  “ being criticised or impugned ; and if they compile a work, they dare not show it,  “lest people should be of a contrary opinion to their own ; so that they never do  “* write, or, if they do, it is as if they were carried off by the birds, or blown away  “by the winds to an enormous distance.? Not one among them pays the least  “* attention, or employs himself for one moment, in collecting the merits of his coun-  “ trymen, or suffers his attention to rest on the brilliant qualities of former Sulténs.  “ None will dip his pen to commemorate the actions of their Katibs and Wizirs, or  “ blot a sheet of paper with the virtuous deeds of their KAdis and Ulemas ; and yet,  “‘ were they to let loose the padlocks of their mouths, and untie the bonds that  VOL.

But were  “ there no other thing in favour of this country than the prophecy uttered by the  “ messenger of God when he announced that it would be subdued by his people,  “and described the first conquerors, from whom we descend, as ‘ angels in armour,’  “ as appears in the sacred tradition that we hold from Tarif Abi Hamzah Ans Ibn  “ Malik,'> who had it from his great aunt Ummu-l-har4m,'* daughter of Malhén,  “and wife of Abi-l-walid ’Obdédah Ibnu-s-s4mah, (may God pour his favours upon  “them all !) which great aunt received it herself from the mouth of the Prophet,—  “ that alone would be sufficient to honour and distinguish this our country, and  “make it superior to any other. For although I am aware that many doctors  “have disputed the interpretation given to the said prophecy, and will continue to  “do so, and are of opinion that the Prophet meant perhaps by it either the island  “ of Sicily or that of Akritis (Crete), although I know the objection will be raised  “that there is no sufficient proof of what I advance, namely, that the Prophet  “ meant by his words Andalus and no other country, and that early traditions like  “this ought not to be admitted and adopted by prudent people unless they be  “accompanied by manifest and convincing evidence, quite disengaged from the  “ ambiguities of language, and resting upon the testimony of good and honourable  “witnesses ; I, nevertheless, persist in giving to the prophecy the aforesaid in-  “ terpretation, as the proofs, in my opinion, are conclusive. I state them, trusting  “in God, whose help and assistance I implore.   “* Tt is well known to every Moslem how our Lord Mohammed was endowed with  “the comprehensiveness of speech and the cream of delivery, and how God  “ Almighty permitted that whatever was revealed to him should be communicated  “with the tongue of eloquence. It is likewise a matter of fact that a tradition  “authenticated and handed down from witness to witness is in existence, purporting  “that the Prophet said once, ‘ that two bands from among his people would furrow  “ the spray of the seas, and make conquest after conquest,’ and that Ummu-l-haram  “having asked him to beseech his Lord, the Almighty God, to make her one of  “the number, he then announced to her that she would be one of the first con-  “ querors ; and so she was, for she joined the naval expedition against Cyprus,  “landed, fought on her mule, and died some time afterwards in the island, (may  “God forgive her!) And certainly no other proof can be required of our Lord  “ Mohammed’s prophetic mission than this acquaintance with and prediction of  “events before they happened. Now this conquest of Cyprus being the first naval",227,book_2,chapter_4
"    174 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    ‘ expedition in which the Moslems were engaged, it becomes evident that the  ‘‘ warriors who subdued that island, and planted in it the banners of Isl4m, were  ‘the same whom the Lord’s messenger designated in his prophecy by that word  “ al-awalin (the first conquerors), and that Ummu-l-hardm being in their number,  “‘ as the Prophet had predicted, she was entitled to be counted among the first con-  ‘* querors. From the above-mentioned fact I draw an inference which admits of no  ** contradiction ; for, owing to the eloquence and perspicuity of speech with which the  “‘ Prophet was gifted by the Almighty, it must be concluded that when he men-  “ tioned two different bands of his people, one of which he specified by calling it  “ the first, there must necessarily follow another called the second. This is, indeed,  ‘a question which appertains to the rules of grammar, the construction of nouns,  “‘ with their relatives, and the syntax of numbers, for it is an imperious rule of  “logic that a second should follow the first ; since the first is not the first but with  “ relation to a second, nor the second such but with relation to a first, although the  “ third need not be mentioned unless it be particularly required by the second. So  “‘ when our Prophet (the Lord’s benediction and salutation be upon him!) an-  “nounced two bands of his people, and foretold two naval expeditions, one of  “which was called by him al-awalin (that of the first conquerors), that word  “must necessarily indicate the existence of another band called akharin (the  “ others), and who with relation to the first would have been the second. And  “‘ these are the people whom the Prophet announced would be the best of men,  “ after the men of his own age, and the first of mankind in virtue and excellence,  “as well as in upholding the tenets of the religion revealed by him who is, and  “* will for ever be, the best of men.   “ «This point once established, I may easily prove that the conquerors of Andalus  ‘were mentioned in the prophecy, since this country was the next which the  “Moslems attacked by sea, the naval expedition directed against Constantinople,  “‘ and which was commanded by Hobeyrah Al-fazéri, not having taken place until  “ the reign of Suleyman Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek.””   “« © As to the island of Sicily, it was not conquered until the year 212 of the Hijra  “ (a.p. 827-8), in the first days of the reign of the Beni Aghlab, the expedition  “ sailing from Africa at the command of Asad Ibnu-l-forét Al-kédi, the friend ’® of  “* Abd Yusuf, who lived and died in the island.   ‘« «Crete was never subdued by the Moslems until the year 203 of the Hijra  “* (a.p. 818-9), when Abi Hafs Omar Ibn Sho’ayb, better known by the surname  “ of Ibnu-l-ghalith, a native of Betréh (Petroche), in the district of Fahsu-l-bolitt,  “ near Cordova, attacked and conquered it at the head of an army of Cordovans,  “whom the Sult4n Al-hakem had, after a rebellion, fought in several battles, and",228,book_2,chapter_4

On the other hand,  “ the elevation of one of her planets ninety degrees is a proof of the aptitude of her  “inhabitants for the sciences, and their high qualifications for them. This is  “ indeed become manifest, and may be proved by several instances, for the Anda-  “ lusians have always shown the greatest aptitude for the theological sciences, such  “as the reading and expounding of the Koran, tradition and canonical juris-  “ prudence; they have exhibited the greatest subtilty and talent in grammar,  “poetry, rhetoric, philology, history, medicine, arithmetic, astrology,—leaving in  “every one of the said branches important works.   “© As to the imputation which the writer of the letter casts upon the learned of  “this country, namely, that they are guilty of neglecting to preserve the names,  “ birth-places, and genealogies, of the individuals who have distinguished themselves  “by their acquirements in certain branches of learning, my answer is, that if the  “ charge preferred against us be as stated, then the same reproach is to be addressed  “to most countries, and to most principal cities and large provinces. So, for  ‘instance, to begin with Cairwan, the birth-place of the writer who accuses us,  “IT do not recollect having read any history of that city, save the account contained  ‘in the book entitled Kitabu-l-mwarrab ft akhbdri-l-maghrebi® (the book of the  “ speaker according to the rules of Arabic grammar on the history of the West),  “and with the exception of what may be found in the works of Mohammed Ibn  “ Yusuf Al-warrak,2> who, as is well known, wrote for Al-mustanser-billah (whom  “may God forgive !) several books on the routes and kingdoms of Africa, on the  “history of its Kings, and their wars with those who rose against them. The same  “author wrote also the history of several African cities, as Tahart,* Wahran  “ (Oran), Tiinis, Sigilmdsah,* Nakir,% Basrah,”” describing the manners and",229,book_2,chapter_4

It  ‘“‘ must be stated that this Mohammed was an Andalusian by origin and by birth ;  “‘ his parents were born at Guadalaxara, and he came to settle in Cordova, where  “he lived and died, and is buried. Had he been born in Cairwdn no doubt he  ‘* would have been adduced as a testimony against what I am endeavouring to  ‘* prove, but, I repeat, he was a native of Guadalaxara, and domiciliated in Cordova.  “* But it being my intention to enter at full length into the subject, and to investi-  “ gate thoroughly the question raised by thee, I shall, with God’s favour, proceed  “‘ to state my arguments.   “It is well known that our most illustrious historians among our ancestors, as  ‘* well as among our contemporaries, without one single exception, all, on the  “ contrary, agreeing with me on the subject, have constantly designated authors  “and other learned men by the patronymic of the country of their residence,  “ provided they did not quit it to travel to other lands, but settled and lived in it  ‘“ until the time of their death ; so, for instance, when our historians or traditionists  “ mention those among the companions of the Prophet who are distinguished by  “ the patronymic surname of Kifiyyin, they will put at the head ’Ali Ibn Abi Télib,  “ Tbn Mas’tid,”® and Khodheyfah.” ’Ali only lived at Kiifah for five years and  ‘* some months, and although he had passed fifty-eight years and months of his  “ life both at Mekka and at Medina, (may God preserve them both!) and had  “« distinguished himself in both those cities, he is placed among the people of  “Kiifah. The same might be said of the two other less illustrious companions  “above mentioned. When they mention the people of Basrah they will begin with  “?*Ammar Ibn Hassin,2® and Ans Ibn Maélik; Hish4m Ibn ’A’mir,?' and Abi  “ Bekrah ;*? although every one of these distinguished individuals was born, had  “* resided, and spent most of his life in the Hejjaz, or in Tehémeh, or in the Tayef,®  “ his residence in the city whence his name is derived having been but insignificant  ‘« compared with the time he had spent in other countries. The same might be said  * of the Shamiyyiin (natives of Damascus) ; they will put the first in the list Ibadah  “ Tbnu-s-sdmah,* Abi-l-dirh4,® Abi ’Obeydah Ibnu-l-jarrah,* Mo’adh,3”7 Mu’a-  ‘* wiyah,>* and others, who are in the same circumstances as the above-mentioned,  “* not having been born nor having resided any length of time in the city of Damascus,  “‘ whence their patronymics are derived. They will count among the Misriyyin  “ (natives of Cairo) ’Amru Ibnu-l-’4ss, and Kharijah Ibn Khod4fah® Al-’abduwi,  “ and among the Mekiyyin (natives of Mekka) ’Abdullah Ibn ’Abb4s,“ and ’Ab-  ‘“‘ dullah Ibn Zobeyr,*! who are precisely in the same case as the above-described.  “ Now those among the learned who at different times have come to settle among  ‘* us we have always treated with justice, since they are held by us in the estimation",230,book_2,chapter_4

But does the same thing  “happen with such among our countrymen as happen to quit this land and settle  “in foreign countries? No,—on the contrary, whenever any of our learned  “leave this their native country to settle in distant lands, no trace whatever is  “ left of them, (may they be happy in the places of their residence!) I shall not,  “therefore, lay claim to Isma’il Ibnu-l-k4sim,*? neither shall we dispute about  “Mohammed Ibn Hani,* unless we put justice above all things, for justice is the  “thing I mostly aim at and desire; and my judgments,—independent of the  “ respective merits of each author (which are not for the present moment) ,—shall  “ be delivered with the greatest impartiality.   “ «But to return to my arguments in favour of my proposition, namely, that the  “earned of other great cities have not been so anxious as they are described in  “collecting and preserving the traditions of their native countries. Baghdéd is  “ certainly the capital of the world, and the mine of every excellence ; it is the city  “whose inhabitants have always been the first to unfurl the banners of knowledge,  “and to raise the standard of science; indeed their subtilty in all branches of  “learning, their gentle manners and amiable disposition, noble bearing, acuteness,  “wit, penetration, and talent, are deservedly praised. Basrah is the spring whence  “all the qualities above mentioned flow to the rest of the world, and yet I know of  “no other work on the history of this former city than that of Ahmed Ibn Abi  “Téhir ;* for although there are other works written by literary men born in that  “city, none that I know has made the history of Baghd4d the chief topic of his  “book. Neither do I know of any works descriptive of Basrah than that of Omar  “Ton Shabah, and that of a man of the tribe of Ar-rabi’, son of Zeyéd,** and  “dedicated to Abi Sufién, which treats upon the topography and divisions of  “that city, and two more works by two of its inhabitants,—one of whom was  “named ’Abdu-l-kéhir, and bore the patronymic surname of Al-kizi,—giving a  “ description of the markets, streets, inns, and so forth, of Basrah. On the history  “ of Kiifah I know of no other work than that of ""Omar Ibn Abi Sheybah ;* and as  “to the countries of Al-jebél, Khorass4n, Tabaristan, Jorjan, Karman, Sejestan,  “and Sind, Rey, Armenia, Adhrabjjin, and many other populous and extensive  “ provinces, I must own that I never saw, in the whole course of my life, one  “single work in which the history of those countries, the good actions of their  “kings, and the talents of their ulemas, poets, and physicians, were satisfactorily   VOL.

In the mean-while, the people of this country were wishing most  “ vehemently for a work that should contain a biographical account of the theo-  “logians of Baghddd, for all we know about them is that they were eminent for  “ their learning, highly praised for their virtues, and much honoured and respected  ‘‘ for their works: had a work on the subject been published, certainly it would  “have reached us, as that of Hamzah Ibnu-l-hasan Al-isfah4ni‘’ on the history  ‘‘ of Isfahén, and that of Al-maussili*® on the history of Maussil (Mosul), and  “‘ many others on the history of Cairo that have been received and read in this  “ country; in the same manner as we have become acquainted with various works  “ written by foreign ‘literati on the different departments of science,—such as the  “ book of Abi-l-’abb4s Mohammed Ibn ’Abdiin Al-cairwéni, being a commentary  ‘ on civil law, and an exposition of the doctrines of the Im4m Shéfa’f,—such as the  ‘* critique which the Kadi Ahmed Ibn Talib At-temimi® wrote against Abi  “ Hanfifeh, and those who followed his sect,—such as the works of Ibn ’Abdits,""!  “and Mohammed Ibn Sahniin,®? and other useful books, which, nevertheless, have  ** not acquired great celebrity for their authors.   “ «In what respects this country I must own that nowhere is that universal  “ proverb, ‘Man always shuns the knowledge of his own people,’ ** so applicable  ‘“‘as it is among us; and, as I recollect having read in the book of the gospels,  ** Jesus (on whom be peace!) said, ‘the Prophet shall not be destitute of honour,  “or protection, but in his own country :’™ nothing is more true, and the saying  “* can be tested by what happened to our own glorious Prophet with the Koray-  “ shites, who, notwithstanding their mild disposition and gentle manners, their  “extreme forbearance, their quick intelligence, their veracity and honour, and  ‘‘many other qualities in which they surpassed every other people on earth,—  “ notwithstanding they had received from the Almighty the most fertile valleys,  “and the best-watered meadows for their habitation,—notwithstanding God had  “« distinguished Aus and Al-khazraj** by gifts which made them the most eminent  “‘ of mankind,—treated the Prophet as is well known.

So, for instance, the Andalusians will always depreciate the works  “ brought before them, they will find fault with the best passages, while they will  ‘* praise and extol those that abound with errors, or are written in a mean and  “* defective style ; their envy and ill-will towards the author will last as long as he  ‘* lives, and be double of what it is in other countries: if an author acquire fame  “by his writings, they will say that he is a literary thief, a plagiarist, a man who",232,book_2,chapter_4

Where did he learn? Whose lessons did he receive? Is he  “an orphan ?—If fate then allow him to enter one of the two ordinary ‘paths of  “ literature, namely, the most frequented and open, or the solitary and deserted,  “if he follow the former they will praise him and extol him above his equals, but  “if he happen to take the latter, to leave the trodden paths and to introduce the  “ least innovation, then begins the fray against the poor author ;** he becomes a  “mark for the sayings of envious people, and an object for the attacks of the  “designing, a stumbling-block for those who are inclined to satire, a prey to the  “ slanderers, and an obstacle in the way of those who wish to travel towards him.  “He will at times be attacked for words which he never uttered, or assailed for  “sentences which he never wrote ; he will be arraigned for opinions which he never  “ entertained,’ and charged with things he never dreamt of. The animosity  “ against him will increase if he happen to be forward in the line he pursues, or if  “he is not sufficiently regarded by his sovereign, or placed in such a position near  “the Sultan as may ensure him from the attacks of his opponents, and the shafts  “of his envious adversaries; for if he venture upon composing a book he will be  “ defamed, opposed, and bitterly criticised ; whatever errors he may have committed  “ will be magnified and exaggerated, his good points will be passed over in silence, his  “ merits will be concealed as with a veil, while he will be continually twitted with  “such things as escaped him, or what he did without proper care and attention :  “the consequence of all this being that the poor author is worried to death, that  “his talents and imagination are sadly impaired by it, that his spirits are broken  “down, and his ardour damped. And do not imagine that I am overcharging the  “ picture, for what I have just related is the true sketch of what is passing every  “ day among us; and whoever undertakes to write a poem, or to compose a risdleh,  “is sure to fall into the circumventing nets that I have just described to thee,  “and to be entangled in their inextricable knots,—nets which will be escaped by him  “ only who has sense enough to foresee the danger, or sufficient courage to face it,  “or who makes himself superior to what may be said or thought of him.

I may quote among  “* others that of the K4di Malik Ibn ’Ali, who was a noble Arab of the tribe of  “ Koraysh, of the branch of the Beni Fehr, and who travelled to the East, where he  ‘* met with the disciples of Malik, and the disciples of his disciples: his work is an  ‘ excellent composition, full of wonderful anecdotes, and abounding with other  “ useful and instructive matter, such as letters, dates respecting the birth and death  “ of illustrious men, and so forth. Of the same kind is the work of Abi Ishak  “« Tbréhim Ibn Mazin, being a commentary on the Mowatté of Malik,“ and other  ‘* works by the same author, in which he not only paid the utmost attention to the  ‘* interpretation of all obscure words in the said book, but likewise collected and  ‘* put together all the information scattered through it. We have by the same  ‘* author a biographical dictionary of all the doctors mentioned in the Mowattd, with  ‘an account of the traditional sayings which Malik held from each of them.   ‘« «Commentaries on the Kordn are likewise numerous. I shall only mention here  “that of Abi ’Abdi-r-rahm4n Baki-bn-Mokhlid,® which is written with so much  “« perfection that I do not hesitate to say that the like of it was never composed in  “ any of the countries subject to the rule of Islam ; and that neither the celebrated  “ commentary by Ibn Jarir At-tabari, nor those of other famous writers, can be  “* compared to it. Abd ’Abdi-r-rahman is likewise the author of a voluminous work  “* on sacred traditions, made in the form of a dictionary, in the following manner :—  “ he first of all arranged alphabetically the names of the companions of the Prophet,  ‘ (may the Lord’s favour be with them !) he then disposed the traditions delivered  “‘ by each companion according to the initial letters of the different heads of juris-  “* prudence and the chapters of judicial decisions, quoting traditions from upwards of  “ one thousand three hundred authors.

The said writer, as well in this as in his other works, displayed the most  “profound learning, and an erudition which no author before him ever showed :  “ the works of this illustrious Im4m became the foundations of Islam, and I may  “ confidently assert that nothing equal to them was ever written. In private life he  “was a most excellent and virtuous man ; he never would accept any public office,  “and was the intimate friend of Ahmed Ibn Hanbal, (may God show him mercy !)   “Qn the legal decisions contained in the Koran we possess the Ahkdmu-l-kordn Legal decisions  “ (decisions of the Korén), a work by Abii Umeyyah Al-hijéri,* who followed the Korén.  “sect of Shafa’i, and wrote in a pure and elegant style: that of the Kadi Abi-l-   . “hakem Mundhir Ibn Sa’id,* who followed the sect of Déid,” and was one of  “his warmest supporters, and wrote a most eloquent and ingenious defence of it.  “ Both the works of these authors on the legal decisions founded on the Koran are  “ really invaluable. Besides the above-mentioned, Mundhir composed other works,  “as the Kitdbu-l-abdnati min hakdyiki osili-d-diydnati (the book of demonstration  “ of the true principles of religious observances).   “* Inthe department of traditions I can quote the work of Abi Mohammed Kasim oer  “Tbn Asbagh Ibn Yusuf Ibn Nassij, as also that of Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-mélik ,  “Tbn Aymen, both of which are compositions of the greatest merit, and contain a  “ greater number of traditional stories, and wonderful anecdotes, than any other  “work which has yet come to my hands. The former of those doctors is likewise  “known as the author of several works which are held in great estimation ; as  “for instance the Kitdb ahkdmi-l-kordn (the book on the decisions of the Koran),  “ following the chapters and divisions of the book of Isma’il,®° and the very sense  “of his words ; Kitdbu-l-mujtant” (the book of the gathering), being a work on  “the same subject, disposed in the same form as that of Ibnu-l-jérdd entitled  “ Kitdbu-l-muntakt™ (the book of selections), to which it is considered far superior,  “not only as containing a greater number of well authenticated traditions and  “ precious allegations, but because it abounds with useful and important learning in  “other matters.

Of the same kind is a commentary on  “traditions by ’A’mir Ibn Khalf As-sarakosti (of Saragossa), which, in the opinion of  “ Abi ’Obeyd, was the most brilliant production of the age. As to the works which  “ the aforesaid writer composed on jurisprudence and the disciples of Malik, there is  “ but one opinion in this country ; they are held in great repute, and considered most  “accomplished performances : one of them, entitled Al-mustakhrdjatu mina-l-isma’ ti  “ (extracts from the hearing of lessons), better known by the title of Al-’otbiyyah,*  “is justly celebrated, and held in great estimation among the people of Africa.   “« Another work by Abi Omar Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-]-mélik Ibn Hishdm Al-ishbili,  “better known by the surnames of Ibnu-l-makiwi® Al-korayshi, is also much  “read.

The author took as his model the collec-  “tion which, under the title of Al-bdhir (the illustrious),®! was published by Abt  “ Bekr Mohammed Ibnu-l-haddéd on the sayings of the Imam Shéafa’i.   “The Kitdbu-l-muntekhab (the book of selections) by the Kadi Mohammed Ibn  “ Yahya Ibn Omar Ibn Lubdbah ® is well known as the most accurate and learned  “ performance that ever issued from the pen of any doctor professing the sect of  “ Malik on the traditions respecting that sect, as well as the best commentary on  “ the obscure points in the same traditions.   “The works of Kdsim Ibn Mohammed, known by the surname of Sdhibu-l-  “ wathdyik,® are famous for the perspicuity of the arguments employed and the good  “ style in which they are written.

The author, I presume, is still living, (may he  live long!) But I cannot proceed any further with my epistle without relating an  “anecdote concerning this distinguished writer. I was told by Abi-l-walid ’Ab-  “ dullah Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah, known by the surname of Ibnu-l-faradhi,  “ that when Abi-l-jeysh Mujahid, King of Al-jez4yir® (Algiers) and Denia, conquered  “* the city of Murcia, he sent to Abi Ghalib, who was then residing in that city, the  “ sum of one thousand dinars of Andalus, on condition that he would make an addi-  “tion to the title-page of the said work, and say that it had been written for him.  “‘ This, however, Abi Ghalib refused to do, and returned the money, nor did he  “ ever afterwards comply with the wishes of the Sultan; on the contrary, he said to  the messenger, ‘Tell your master that were he to lavish on me all the treasures  “ of this world, I would persist in my resolution ; I cannot tell a lie; this book of  “‘ mine was not written for him, but for the generality of studious people.’ When  Abi Ghalib’s answer was communicated to Mujéhid, he was very much surprised  “at the boldness and severity of his words, but he could not help admiring the  steel temper of the writer’s soul, and his contempt for worldly considerations.”  ‘“* * Ahmed Ibn Iban Ibn Seyid!® wrote a work on the language, entitled Kitdbu-l-  ‘« *dlimi (the book of the learned), composed of about one hundred parts,’” and  “‘ treating on genders. The subject is therein treated with the fullest details, and  ‘all the nouns in the Arabic language, beginning with globe (al-folk), and ending  with dorrah (a grain of millet), are properly explained.  “©The Kitdbu-n-nawddir (the book of the rarities of speech) by Abt ’Ali Isma’il  “ Tbnu-l-késim,'™ being a sort of glossary to ‘ the book of complement’ (Kitdbu-I-  “ kdémil) by Ibnu-l-’abbés Al-mubarrad,'® is justly celebrated. And, by my life, I  “ do think that the work of Ibnu-l-’abbds exhibits neither the profound knowledge  of grammar nor the exquisite erudition of the former, whose work is likewise more  “‘ abundant in rhetorical and poetical extracts.   “* « An author named Sa’id Ibnu-I-hasan Ar-raba’i,""* who followed in the steps of  ‘the two last-mentioned writers, composed a work entitled ‘the book of gems”  “ (Kitdbu-l-fossiss).",238,book_2,chapter_4

This  “ last-mentioned work has of late been increased by Abii-l-hej4j Al-bayési (of  “ Baéza), who is now residing at Tunis, the capital of Africa proper, where he  “enjoys the favours and protection of the Sultén.   “The Kitdbu-l-mudhdhafert,® so called from the name of its author, Al-  “ mudhdhafer Ibn Al-afttas, King of Badajoz, a work almost equal to the Matin  “of Ibnu Hayyd4n in number of volumes, and which embraces the political and  “literary history of the times, is justly considered to be one of the most brilliant  “ productions of the age.   “A history of the Sulténs of the Lamtumni dynasty, by Ibn Sdhibi-s-salat,'®  “and another on the same subject by Ibnu-s-seyrafi,""” of Granada, which I have  “not read, but which is much praised by Ibnu Ghalib, are among our best works  “ofthe kind.

Ibn Besdm, the author of the Dhakhtrah (treasure),  “from whom the preceding information is taken, borrowed considerably from the  “ poetical writings of Abi Télib. But this is not the moment for judging of the  “ respective merits of these two authors. The book very much resembles the  “ supplement to the Kitdbu-l-haddyik (the book of enclosed gardens) by Ibn Faraj.   “ At the same time, and almost in our days,** Al-fath published his Kaldyidu-l-  “*ikiydn (golden necklaces), a work full of eloquence, and held in great estimation  “by the learned. We have likewise by him a work bearing the title of Matmahu-l-  “ anfus (place of recreation of the soul),°> and of which there are three editions, great,  “ middling, and small. Its contents are the lives of illustrious men contained in his  “ Kaldyid, and others who lived before them. Since the publication of these two  “ works by Al-fath, a work entitled Simétu-l-jumdni wa sakittu-l-marjdni (pearl  “necklaces and showers of seed pearls) has appeared, by Abé ’Amru Ibnu-l-im4m.*  “ Tt is a sort of supplement to the Kaldyid and to the Matmah, wherein the author  “ has introduced the lives of all those eminent men who either escaped Al-fat’h’s  “research or lived after him ; as likewise of many distinguished authors who  “ flourished since Al-fat’h’s death up to the end of the sixth century of the Hijra.  “Lastly, a supplement to the two preceding works, containing a biography of  “eminent men who flourished likewise in the seventh century of the Hijra, has  “been published of late years by Abii Bahr Sefwan Ibn Idris, from Murcia, under  “ the title of Zdédu-l-musdfiri® (provisions for the traveller). It is a small volume,  “but precious for its information.   “ Abt Mohammed ’Abdullah Ibn Ibrahim Al-hijéri (from Guadalaxara) wrote the  “ Kitdbu-l-mas‘habi ft fadhdyili-l-maghrebi® (the book of the chatterer on the excel-  “ences of the West), which appeared after the Kaldyid and the Dhakhirah. It  “embraces the history of Andalus from the earliest times down to his days. The  “ author, too, followed a new plan in the arrangement of his materials, since, along  “with his exquisite historical information, he described at full length some of the  “principal cities in that country, enumerated the peculiarities of the soil, and  “ treated on matters which belong to the science of geography, giving also numerous  “extracts from the works of distinguished authors and poets, as the reader must  “have remarked by our frequent quotations from the said work. A better history  “of Andalus never was written,—a reason why it was so much extolled and  “ praised by our ancestor ’Abdu-l-mdlik Ibn Sa’id,*? who worked upon it, and  “wrote a supplement, which was continued by his two sons Ahmed and Mo-  “hammed, afterwards by Misa, son of Mohammed, and lastly by ’Alf, son of  “ Misa, the writer of this book, and the author of the work entitled Falaku-l-adabi-  “ Lmuheytti biholt lisdni-l-’arabi (the book of the sphere, embracing the beauties of",249,book_2,chapter_5

The readers will also find a full  “ notice of people who escaped publicity in their time, and authors who had been  ‘mentioned by previous writers, but who have been placed in a more perspicuous  “and orderly manner under the cities or towns whence their patronymics are  “derived. So, for instance, Ibn Besém will be found under the head of Shan-  “tareyn (Santarem), his birth-place, Al-fat’h under Seville, Ibnu-l-im4ém under  “ Ezija, Al-hijari under Guadalaxara, and so forth.   ‘* Respecting works on literature, whether in prose or verse, I can mention first of  “all the Serdju-l-adab® (torch of polite literature), by Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Abi-l-  ‘ khissél, from Segura, who is justly held as the prince of Andalusian authors.  “ He is said to have written it in rivalry of the Kitdbu-n-nawddir (the book of  ‘‘memorable sayings), by Abi ’Ali Al-k4li, and of the Kitdb szohori-l-adabi  “« (flowers of polite literature), by Al-hossri.“© Of the same kind is the Kitdbu-l-  “ wdjibi-l-adabi (manual of literature), by my father Misa Ibn Mohammed Ibn  “‘ Sa’id, whose name alone is a voucher for its contents. Another book very  “much consulted on the subject is the Kitdbu-l-ludli*!

Indeed were I merely to  “ mention here the titles of all the good works that exist on the subject I should  “ run the risk of protracting this my narrative to an indefinite length ; I shall there-  “ fore confine myself to noticing a few only of the most prominent, such as those of  “ Tbn Kharif,“ Ar-rondi,*? and the Sheikh Abi-l-hasan Ibn ’Osfir,** from Seville,  “‘ who surpassed all his contemporaries in the science of grammar, in which he  “ arrived at the extreme end of knowledge, his works being at the present moment  “« the books of reference and authority in the East as well as in the West. I lately  “received from Africa proper a book by this author, on syntax, entitled <Al-  “ mukarreb ft-l-nahu (the book of approximation on the science of syntax), which  “is to be found in almost every large town in Yemen, and has flown on the wings  “ of fame.   “The Sheikh Abi ’Ali Ash-shalibini has also acquired immense reputation by  “* his commentary on the syntax, entitled Kitdbu-t-tautiyati-l-jaziliyyati (the treading  “ on the footsteps of Al-jazili).”   “ Tbnu-s-sid Al-bathalidsi, Ibnu-t-tard4wah, and As-sohayli have published several  “ treatises on grammar, which do their authors great honour, and are in the hands  “‘of every student. And lastly there is a famous commentary on the works of  “ Sibauyeh by Abi-l-hasan Ibn Kharif.   “In the science of geography it will be sufficient to mention the Kitdbu-l-mesdlek Geography.  “ wa-l-memdlek (the book of routes and kingdoms), by Abi ’Obeyd Al-bekri Al-  “ondbi (from Onoba), and the Kitdbu-l-mu’ajem,” being a geographical dictionary  “wherein all names of cities and kingdoms are properly explained.

Another  “ Andalusian musician who lived in the sixth century of the Hijra, and whose name  “was Yahya Ibnu-l-haddéj Al-a’lem,** wrote a collection of songs in imitation of  “ that of Abi-1-faraj.   ‘“‘ Medicine has always flourished in this country, and among the numerous  “« treatises on this science written by Andalusian physicians several may be pointed  ‘‘ out which have attained the greatest celebrity not only in the West but in the  ‘« East, where they are much used and consulted. Of this number is the Kitdbu-t-  “ teystr (introduction to medicine), by ’Abdu-l-m4lik Ibn Abi-l-’ol4 Ibn Zohr, who  ‘« is likewise the author of the Kitdbu-l-agh’diyati (the book of diet), which has  “‘ become famous throughout the East and West.   “ Abd-l’abbds Ibnu-r-raémiyyah® Al-ishbili (from Seville), our friend and contem-  ‘porary, has written several standard works on this science, among which I must  ‘‘make particular mention of a treatise on simples used as medicaments (Kitdbu-  “ |-adwiyati-l-mufridah).   “ Abi Mohammed,” from Malaga, who is now residing in Cairo, is the author  “« of d voluminous work, a sort of dictionary, wherein he has disposed alphabetically  “all the names of simples and medicaments that he could collect and analyze  ‘himself, or which were described in the works of Al-ghéfeki,®* Az-zahréwi, and  “« Sherif Al-idrisi, the Sicilian,®® with many others. And certainly a better work  ‘on the science cannot easily be imagined.   ‘« Natural philosophy also flourishes with us. The prince of this science among  “‘ us is at present Abi-l-walid Ibn Roshd, from Cordova, who has written several  “ treatises on the various branches of that science, notwithstanding the aversion and  “dislike which ’Abdu-l-mimen, son of Al-manstr, always showed towards the  “« students who practised it, and notwithstanding his having been put in prison by  ‘ order of that Sultén for persisting in his favourite studies. The same might be  “ said of Ibn Habib,*’ whom the same Sultan caused to be put to death because it  ‘ was proved against him that he worked secretly at that science, which is now  “a proscribed one in this country ; this being the reason why men inclined to it  “« cultivate and practise it only in secret, and why books on the topic are so very  “* scarce.   ‘* We have, nevertheless, several astronomical treatises by Ibn Zeyd Al-askaf  “‘ (the Bishop) of Cordova,*® who was a great favourite with the Sultén Al-  ‘* mustanser, son of An-ndssir Al-merwaéni.

Cordova is perhaps of all Mohammedan cities that which has been most fully  described by natives as well as by foreign writers. The East and the West abound  with accounts, some in prose, others in verse, in which the glories and magnificence  of that splendid capital have been so minutely recorded as to expel from the  imagination of the antiquarian all fear of their obliteration. An Eastern author,  among others, gives us the following picture -—‘t Cordova,” such are his words,  ‘* is the capital of Andalus, and the mother of its cities; the court of the Khalifs,  ‘Sand the seat of their empire. It was in ancient times the court of the infidel  * kings of Andalus, and afterwards became the residence of the Mohammedan  ** sovereigns who succeeded them. It was the abode of science, the place of refuge",254,book_3,chapter_1

Cordova is a  “ populous city, full of primitive buildings, enjoying a good temperature, abounding  “ with springs of the sweetest water, and surrounded on all sides by gardens, olive  “ plantations, villages, and castles. Numerous springs and winding brooks irrigate  “ and fertilize the neighbouring fields and farms, which in point of extent, careful  “ cultivation, and abundant produce, have nowhere their equal in the world.”   Ar-rdzi calls Cordova the mother of cities, the navel of Andalus, the court of the  kingdom in ancient and modern times, during the ages of ignorance as well as  during the period of Islam. Its river, he says, is the largest in all Andalus, and over  it was thrown a bridge, which not only was the finest in that country, but which for  its structure, beautiful design, and colossal dimensions, was reputed one of the  wonders of the earth.   Another writer describes it as the largest city in all Andalus, and one which  had no rival either in the East or the West in point of size, population, mag-  nificence of buildings, width and cleanliness of the streets, spaciousness of markets,  number and beauty of mosques, and quantity of baths and inns. Some of the  tative authors go so far as to state that in point of magnitude it approached  Baghdéd. But the report is no doubt exaggerated.   It is, says another, a fortified town, surrounded by massive and lofty stone walls,  and has very fine streets. It was in times of old the court and residence of many  infidel kings, whose palaces are still visible within the precincts of the walls. The  inhabitants are famous for their courteous and polished manners, their superior  intelligence, their exquisite taste and magnificence in their meals, drink, dress, and  horses. There thou wouldst see doctors shining with all sorts of learning, lords  distinguished by their virtues and generosity, warriors renowned for their ex-  peditions into the country of the infidels, and officers experienced in all kinds of  warfare. The Cordovans were further celebrated for the elegance and richness of  their dress, their attention to religious duties, their strict observance of the hours  of prayer, the high respect and veneration in which they held their great mosque,  their aversion to wine and their destruction of wine-vases whenever they found  any, their abhorrence of every illicit practice, their glory in nobility of descent and  nilitary enterprise, and their success in every department of the sciences.

To it came from all parts of the world  “‘ students anxious to cultivate poetry, to study the sciences, or to be instructed  “« in divinity or the law; so that it became the meeting-place of the eminent in all  ‘matters, the abode of the learned, and the place of resort for the studious : its  “interior was always filled with the eminent and the noble of all countries, its  ‘‘ literary men and soldiers were continually vying with each other to gain dis-  “ tinction,’ and its precincts never ceased to be the arena of the distinguished, the  “ hippodrome of the foremost, the halting-place of the noble, and the repository of  “ the true and virtuous. Cordova was to Andalus what the head is to the body, or  ‘* what the breast is to the lion.”   A poet has written on Cordova the following distich, which is not altogether  devoid of merit :   “Do not talk of the court of Baghdad and its dlittering magnificence, do  “‘ not praise Persia and China and their manifold advantages,   “ For there is no spot on the earth like Cordova, nor in the whole world  “ men like the Beni Hamdin.” ?   Tbnu Sa’id calls Cordova the bride of the kingdom of that name; meaning that  she was provided with every requisite to make a city famous, and that she had  within herself all the beauties and ornaments of a beautiful maid who is being taken  to the house of her lord and spouse. Indeed no comparison can be made more  adequate than this ; since the fact of her having been the residence of so many  Sultans constitutes the diadem on her head; her necklace is strung with the’  inestimable pearls collected in the Ocean of language by her orators and poets ; her  robes are made of the banners of science, those learned authors for whom neither  prose nor verse had any limits, and whose praises it is not prudent to let loose;  and, lastly, the masters in all arts and trades form the skirt of her gown. After  this Ibnu Sa’id gives a sort of argument of his work, from which we shall proceed    . to quote, taking care to introduce accounts from other writers in order that in-    formation may spring from comparison.   There are various opinions among historians as to who was the founder of  Cordova. Some, as Ibnu Hayydn, Ar-rdzi, Al-hijdri, say that it was built by  Octavius, the second Czsar of Rome, who conquered the whole earth, and lined  with copper the bed of the Tiber; the same emperor from whom the Roman Era,  which began thirty-eight years before the birth of the Messiah, is computed. To  this monarch, who, in the opinion of the above-mentioned authors, was the builder  of the great bridge in Cordova, is the foundation of that city ascribed, together with  that of other places equally important ; such as Merida, Seville, and Saragossa.®  Al-hijéri, however, is of opinion that these three cities, as well as Cordova, owed",256,book_3,chapter_1
"    CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 203    ‘their foundation to the lieutenants of that king, and not to himself; for having sent  to Andalus four of his principal officers, he gave them instructions to divide the  country into four provinces, to take the command of the armies stationed in them,  and to build each a city which should be the capital of the province placed under  his charge ; and that the lieutenants, having done what they were ordered to do,  each built a city to which he gave his name. Such is the account given by Al- |  hijdri, who is no doubt mistaken, since the four above-mentioned cities do not  derive their names, as he says, from their founders, but from the localities in which  they stand, or the quality of the ground on which they were built, and other cir-  cumstances quite independent of the names of their governors or founders.   However, towards the end of the Roman empire, Cordova became the capital of  the sons of ’Ayssu,‘ son of Ishak, son of Ibrahim, (on whom be peace!) another  nation of Romans, who conquered Andalus and settled in it, keeping possession of  the country until they themselves were subdued by the Goths, the sons of Yéfeth,  in whose hands was the empire when the Moslems invaded Andalus. During the  reign of the monarchs of Gothic descent, Cordova cannot be said to have been the  capital of Andalus ; for although it served as a place of temporary residence to some  of their kings, it was not, properly speaking, the court of the empire. By the  establishment of Islim in it, its importance increased ; it became the capital of the  Mohammedan empire, and the citadel of the family of Merwdn, so that Seville and  Toledo were soon obliged to acknowledge its pre-eminence. God Almighty does  what he pleases, for he is the master of all things, and in his hands are power and  command. There is no God but Him, the great! the high!   Respecting the name of Cordova, Abii ’Obeyd Al-bekri tells us, that according to Etymology of  Gothic pronunciation it ought to be written with a dha with a point over it, thus,  Kordhobah. Al-hijari writes it with a tta and a dhamma, Korttubah ; but Eastern  writers in general have corrupted the pronunciation of this word, as they have done  with many others, by substituting a kesrah for the dhamma, and writing it thus,  Korttebah. As to the etymology of the word Korttubah, we find in the Forjatu-l-  anfus, by Ibnu Ghalib, that it is a Greek word, meaning in that language Al-kolibu-  Lmashkilah, that is, doubtful hearts.© Ibnu Sa’id agrees with these authors as to  the manner in which the word Kordhubah is to be spelt, but he entertains quite a  different opinion as to the origin of the city, which he says was founded by the  *Amalekites (Carthaginians), and not by the Romans; he also gives a different  etymology to that word, which he pretends means in Arabic ajaru sdkiniha (reward  of its inhabitants).   Tonu Sa’id (the mercy of God be upon him!) describes the kingdom of Cordova  before all the rest in Andalus ; for, says he, it was for many centuries the seat of  government. The ancient kings of Andalus fixed in it the seat of their empire, and",257,book_3,chapter_1

They  chose to reside in Cordova in preference to any other city of Andalus, for its  convenient situation and delightful temperature. It became in the course of time  the meeting-place of the learned from all countries, and, owing to the power and  splendour of the mighty dynasty that ruled over it, it contained more excellences  than any other kingdom on the face of the earth.   But before proceeding in our account of Cordova we deem it necessary to acquaint  the readers with the titles, divisions, and. contents of the various chapters de-  voted by Ibnu Sa’id to the description of that city, and forming part of that great  historical work which we have so often quoted in the course of our narrative, and  to which we shall have still numerous opportunities of referring.   Tbnu Sa’id (may God show him mercy !) followed a plan of his own, and divided  his history into three volumes or sections.”   The first bears the title of ‘‘ the book of variegated leaves on the ornamental  beauties of Andalus.”   The second, which treats on the history of Sicily, he called ‘ the book of bar-  barous cacophony on the beauties of the island of Sicily.”   The third, which embraces the history of all the infidel nations inhabiting the  great continent (of Europe), is entitled ‘“‘ the book of the extreme limit on the  beauties of the great land (or continent of Europe).”   Each of these volumes he divided into several books, and these into numerous  chapters.® For instance, the first, which contained the description of Andalus, was  composed of four books; the first entitled ‘‘ ornaments of the bride on the de-  scription of the west of Andalus ;” the second, ‘the lips of the beautiful dusky  maid on the description of the central provinces of Andalus ;” the third, ‘‘ the book  of familiarity and friendship on the description of eastern Andalus ;” and the fourth,  ‘‘the book of dubious lines on the geography and the history of those provinces  which are in the hands of the worshippers of the crucified.”   The second volume, which treated on the history of Sicily, he likewise divided  into several books ; and the same may be said of that which treats on the history  of the great land (continent).   The first book of the first volume being that which contains the history of  Cordova, and the provinces once subject to it, and likewise that which forms the  present object of our narrative, we shall describe it more minutely. Its title is,  as we have above stated, ‘‘ the book of ornaments of the bride on the description of  western Andalus.” It is divided into seven chapters (each chapter being also  divided into several paragraphs), the titles of which are as follow.®",258,book_3,chapter_1

In every one of these chapters the author relates all the particulars, whether  historical or geographical, which he could collect respecting each province, (may  God remunerate him amply for his trouble in illustrating the history of the  Moslems!) In that concerning Cordova, for instance, he accumulated the most  precious information on the size, extent, and population of that capital, on the  magnificence and splendour of its mosques, palaces, and other public buildings,  on the fertility and careful cultivation of the fields and lands in the neighbourhood,  on the peculiarities and productions of the soil, and the like. He also divided the  chapter exclusively consecrated to Cordova into eleven smaller divisions, each  treating on one of the districts which acknowledged at one time the jurisdiction  of Cordova.

Part 1, the description of Cordova; part 2, that of the  city of Az-zahré; part 3, that of the city of Az-zdhirah ; part 4, the description  of the suburb called Shakandah, and the district of Waza’h."" '   The dimensions of Cordova have been differently stated, owing, no doubt, to the Bie ana oxen  rapid increase of its population and buildings under the various Sultans of the “  dynasty of Merwén, and to the heart-rending calamities and disasters by which it  was afflicted under the reign of the last sovereigns of that house. Ibnu Sa’id,  quoting Ash-shakandi’s epistle, says that the city of Cordova, with the adjoining  cities of Az-zahr&é and Az-zéhirah, covered at one time an extent of ground  measuring ten miles in length, all which distance, adds that author, might be   / traversed at night by the light of lamps.

Another says that Cordova was divided into five large districts or cities, separated  one from another by a high and well fortified wall, and that all these put together  measured three miles in length and one in width.   The suburbs are said to have been twenty-one in number, each of them provided  with mosques, markets, and baths for the use of its inhabitants ; so that the people  of one had no occasion to repair to the other, either for religious purposes or to buy  the necessaries of life. Ibnu Bashkiwél, who has given us a description of Cordova  during its greatest prosperity, and when the influx of population was at its height,    - has preserved the names of the suburbs which once were joined to Cordova.    Two lay to the south, on the opposite bank of the river, and their names were  Shakandah and Munyat-’A’jab (the garden of the wonders). Nine to the west,  namely, Hawdnttu-r-rihdn (the shops of the sellers of sweet basil),""* Rabadh-ar-  rakkdkin (the suburb of the bakers), Mesjidu-l-kahfi (the mosque of the cave),  Baldtt Mugheythi (the palace of Mugheyth), Mesjidu-sh-shakdi (the mosque of  misfortune), Hamdmu-l-anbirt (the baths of Al-anbiri),!° Mesjidu-s-sorrir (the  mosque of rejoicings), Mesjidu-r-raudhah'” (the mosque of the garden), and  As-sojunu-l-kadim (the old prison).

"    cHaP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 207    In the midst of the city, and surrounded by these suburbs, stood the Kassdbah  (citadel) of Cordova, which was fortified and defended by high walls, although  the suburbs were not so; but during the civil wars a ditch was dug round the ~  suburbs, and the whole enclosed within high and strong walls raised at the same  time. The circumference of this wall, according to Ibnu Sa’id, was twenty-  four miles, including Shakandah, which, being an ancient walled town, was also  comprised within the limits of the fortifications of Cordova.   The gates of Cordova were seven in number, according to Ibnu Bashkiiwal. Gates.  Ist. The gate of the bridge (Bdbu-l-kantarah), also called Bdbu-l-wddt, or gate  of the river. 2nd. Bédbu-l-jeztrati-l-khadhrd (the gate of Algesiras), also leading  to the river. Both these gates looked to the south. 3rdly. Bdbu-l-hadfd (the  iron gate), named also Bdb Sarakosta (gate of Saragossa), Bdb Ibn ’Abdi-l-jabbdr  (the gate of the son of ’Abdi-l-jabbdr) ; also called gate of Toledo, and gate of  the Christian (Bdbu-r-rimiyyah). At the latter-mentioned gate was the junction  of the causeways built by the Romans, to which we have alluded in another part  of this work, and which we have said made the circuit of the earth, coming from  Cadiz, Carmona, passing by Cordova, and then going to Rome through Saragossa,  Tarragona, Narbonne, and the great continent.!® 4th. The gate of Talavera, which  was also called gate of Leon. 5th. The gate of ’A’mir the Korayshite, opposite  to the cemetery of that name. 6th. Bdbu-l-jiz (or the gate of the walnuts), also  known by the name of gate of Badajoz. 7th, and last, Bdbu-l-’dttarin (the gate of  the druggists), commonly called the gate of Seville. There was still another gate,  formerly called Bdbu-l-yahid (the gate of the Jews), but good Moslems having  objected to the name, it was named Bdbu-l-hodi (the gate of direction). The poet  Abd ’A’mir Ibn Shohayd wrote on this gate the following distich :   “‘ They saw near to the gate of the Jews the star of Abi-l-hasan darken  “* and vanish.   “When the Jews saw him commanding over their gate, they took him for  ** Joseph.” ®   The same historian, describing the royal palace of Cordova, says that it was an The Royal  ancient building inhabited in former days by the infidel Sult4ns who had ruled over Palace  the country since the time of Moses.” The interior of it, as well as the adjoining  buildings, was full of primeval constructions, and wonderful remains of the Greeks,  Romans, and Goths,” and other nations now extinct, and the interior apartments  were so magnificently decorated as to dazzle with the beauty of their ornaments the  eyes of the beholders. This palace the Khalifs of the house of Merwan chose for  their residence, and tried to ornament and embellish by all possible means, adding  new rooms, and filling them with elegant rarities.

The water thus brought from the moun-  tains was conveyed to this palace, and thence distributed into every corner and  quarter of the city by means of leaden pipes, from which it flowed into basins of  different shapes, made of the purest gold, the finest silver, or plated brass, as well  as into vast lakes, curious tanks, and amazing reservoirs,* and fountains of Grecian  marble beautifully carved. In this palace, too, was an astonishing jet d’eau which  raised the water to a considerable height, and the like of which was nowhere to be  seen in the East or West.   The palace here described by Ibnu Bashkiwél must be the same which some  early writers designate under the name of Baldtt Rudherik, (the palace of Roderic ;)  not that this king built it, but when the Arabs defeated him, and conquered his  kingdom, knowing that whenever he came to Cordova he took up his abode in it,  they called it by his name. By whom it was built is not ascertained ; the most  current opinion among the natives was that one of their ancient kings* who  resided in the fortress of Almodovar, below Cordova, was the builder of it, and this  they relate in the following manner. They say that as this king was one day  hunting, he came to the spot where Cordova was afterwards built, which was  then a dreary desert, the site now occupied by the palace being covered by an  impervious thicket of brambles. Near this spot the king let fly a favourite hawk  of his at a partridge, which, rising in the field afterwards called Kudyat Abt  ’Obeydah (the hillock of Abt ’Obeydah), passed him, and alighted on the thicket.  Thither the hawk flew in chase of the partridge, and the king followed in quest of  his hawk, until, not seeing him appear, and fearing lest he should be entangled  among the branches and unable to move, the king ordered the thicket to be cleared  away that his hawk might be released. While his people were employed in cutting  the underwood, behold! the top of a large and magnificent building was discovered  by the workmen, a most amazing structure, all built with large blocks of stone  joined together with molten lead. The king, who was an intelligent and enter-  prising man, immediately ordered an excavation to be made, and the building was  speedily laid open in all its length and breadth; proceeding in their work they  came to the foundations, which they found lying in the water, and resting upon a  stratum of small pebbles, there introduced by art of old. When the king saw this,  he exclaimed, ‘‘ This is no doubt the work of some famous monarch, and I must  “have it rebuilt.” Upon which he issued orders that the building should be",262,book_3,chapter_1
"    CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN."" 209    restored to its primitive state, which being done, and the place made habitable, he  visited it as often as any of his royal castles ; for whenever he made the tour of his  province, or passed near it on his way to some military expedition, he always resided  in it for some length of time. This induced many of his subjects to settle in the  neighbourhood, and little by little the city of Cordova was built, and the palace  which stood in the middle of it became the abode of the kings, his successors.   But to return to Ibnu Bashktwal’s description. ‘ Among the gates of the  “ palace,—those gates,” says that historian, ‘‘ which God Almighty opened for the  “ redress of injuries, the help of the oppressed, and the dispensing of impartial judg-  “ments in all cases of law,—the principal is one which has a projecting balcony,”  “ without its equal in the world. This gate, which gave entrance to the palace,  “was furnished with folding-doors covered with iron plates, to which was affixed a  “ brass ring of exquisite workmanship, and representing a man with his mouth wide  “open. This extraordinary work of art, which took its rise at the lower part of the  “gate, and served at the same time as a bar to the gate and as a knocker, had in  “former times belonged to one of the gates of the city of Narbonne, in the country  “of the Franks ; but when the Amir Mohammed” took that city from the Chris-  “tians he had it removed and brought to Cordova, and placed on the principal  “gate of his palace. On a line with this, and looking to the south, there was  “another gate, called Bdbu-l-jenndn (the gate of the gardens) ; and opposite to it,  “on a platform overlooking the Guadalquivir, two mosques famous for their  “sanctity and the numerous miracles wrought in them, in either of which the  “Sultan Mohammed Ar-r4dhi* used to sit to administer justice to his subjects,  “anxious to gain thereby the abundant rewards of the Almighty. A third, called  “ Bdbu-l-wddt (the gate of the river), and a fourth, called Béb Koriah (the gate of  “Coria), opened to the north. There was a fifth and last gate, known by the name  “of Babu-l-jdmi’ (the gate of the great mosque), because the Khalifs used in  “ancient times to go out of it whenever they visited the great mosque on Fridays,  “carpets being spread under their feet the whole of the way.” However, most of  these gates, Ibnu Bashkiiwal tells us, were either destroyed or blocked up during the  civil war under the reign of ’Abdu-l-jabbar.   Besides the royal palace here alluded to there were in and out of Cordova ean  Various houses and gardens, also built by the Sulténs and Khalifs of the house of gardens be-  Merwin for their habitation or their pleasure. We shall describe some of the the Khalifs  sais celebrated. Ibnu Sa’id says, ‘‘ I shall now proceed to the description of the   “Ppleasure-gardens and public promenades where the people of Cordova passed  “their leisure hours, or which they visited for the sake of recreation and amuse-    “ment. Of these some belonged to the Sultan, others to wealthy citizens. Among  VoL, I. 25",263,book_3,chapter_1

He also planted a most beautiful  ‘“‘ garden, to which he brought all kinds of rare and exotic plants and fine trees  “from every country, taking care to supply it with sufficient water for irrigation.  ‘* His passion for flowers and plants went even so far as to induce him to send  ‘* agents to Syria and other countries, with a commission to procure him all sorts  “* of seeds and plants ; and, when brought to Andalus, these productions of distant  ‘“‘ regions and various climatés failed not to take root, blossom, and bear fruit  ‘in the royal gardens, whence they afterwards spread all over the country.  “ From this garden originates the pomegranate, called Safart,*° which in point of  “ flavour, smallness of seed, and abundance of juice, has not its equal in the  ‘“‘ world, and is superior to any other fruit growing in Andalus. The manner in  ‘‘ which this fruit was introduced into the country, and the origin of its name, are  “ thus related. They say that one of the agents sent by ’Abdu-r-rahman to Syria,  “* for the purpose of providing him with every exotic plant he could procure, sent  ‘him from Damascus, among other rarities, a sort of pomegranate, which being  “* originally from the garden called Risséfat-Hishédm was, when planted in Andalus,  “ known by the name of Rissdff. Being proud of them, ’Abdu-r-rahmén boasted  “of the acquisition before his favourites, and proceeded to describe the nature  ‘“and qualities of the tree, the flavour and colour of the fruit, and the manner  ‘‘ in which it had been procured and sent to him. There happened to be among  “the company a man of the name of Safar Ibn ’Obeyd Al-kal’ai, one of the  “settlers from Al-urdan,*' and who is further represented as belonging to the  “* Ansaris who bore the colours of the Prophet in battle, as well as those of the  “ Khalifs of the house of Umeyyah. To this Safar the Sultin gave some of the  “fruit, and he, keeping the seed, sowed it some time afterwards in a village  “of the district of Raya, where he resided; he nursed the tree, took care of it,  ‘lopped its branches, and when the tree came to bear fruit he selected the best  ‘“* pomegranate and repaired with it to court, where he presented himself to  “?Abdu-r-rahman. No sooner did the Sultdn see the fruit, which so much  ‘resembled that of his gardens in colour and appearance, and the flavour of  ‘which was equally fine, than he was greatly astonished, and inquired from Safar  ‘‘how he had procured it. Safar then acquainted him with the circumstance,  ‘‘and ’Abdu-r-rahman was so much pleased that he praised highly his industry,  “ thanked him for his zeal, made him a considerable present, and ordered that  ‘more trees of the same kind should be planted in the Rissdfah as well as in  “ other of his pleasure-gardens. Safar on his side augmented also his plantation,",264,book_3,chapter_1

But to returr to the palace of the Riss4fah, which ’Abdu-r-rahman ornamented  with costly magnificence, and to which he conveyed water from the distant  mountains. We find that it was situate to the north of Cordova, and that when  *Abdu-r-rahman built it he called it Munyatu-r-rissdfah (the pleasure-gardens  of the Rissdfah,)** after a palace of a similar name which his grandfather Hisham  had built in Damascus. ’Abdu-r-rahmd4n was moreover exceedingly fond of it,  and he used to dwell in it for the greatest part of the year, an inclination in  which his grandfather Hisham had likewise considerably indulged. Nor was  this the only palace built by ’Abdu-r-rahmén or his successors; there were  besides in Cordova several royal villas remarkable either for the magnificence  of their structure or their delightful situation. Of this number were “the palace  of the confluent ” (Kasru-l-hdjiri) ;* ‘the palace of the garden” (Kasru-r-  raudhat) ; ‘‘the palace of the flowers” (Kasru-s-adhiru) ; ‘‘the palace of the  lovers”? (Kasru-l-ma’shik) ; ‘‘ the palace of the fortunate” (Kasru-l-mubdrik) ;  “ the palace of Rustak” (Kasru-r-rustak) ; ‘the palace of contentment” (Kasru-  s-sorrir) ; ‘the palace of the diadem” (Kasru-t-tdj); and ‘‘ the palace of the  novelties ” (Kasru-l-badiyi’).   Without the city was the palace of Sidi Abii Yahya Ibn Abi Ya’ktb Ibn ’Abdi-  l-mimen,* built on arches on the Guadalquivir. Its founder being once asked  how he, who had such an aversion to the people of Cordova, could take delight  in building this palace, replied, that knowing how soon a governor was forgotten  by them after his removal unless he showed them proofs of power and authority,  having their heads full of the splendour of the Khalifate during the dynasty of  Merwan, he wished to leave behind him some memorial of his stay which would  make the inhabitants remember him in spite of themselves.   Another palace called Dimashk is mentioned by Al-fat’h in his Kaldyid, when  Writing the life of the Wizir Ibn ""Ammar. He describes it as a pleasure-house  belonging to the Sultans of the house of Merwdn, the roofs of which were supported  by beautiful marble columns, and the floors paved with mosaic of a thousand hues.   “ All palaces in the world are nothing when compared to that of Dimashk,  “for not only it has gardens filled with the most delicious fruits and sweet-  “ smelling flowers,   “ Beautiful prospects, and limpid running waters, clouds pregnant with  “ aromatic dew, and lofty buildings ;",265,book_3,chapter_1

Munyat-Zubeyr was the name of another pleasure-house in the outskirts of  Cordova, which Zubeyr Ibn ’Omar Al-mulaththam® built for himself during his  government of that city. There were besides several other gardens and pleasure-  houses in Cordova called Munyat ; as, for instance, Munyatu-sorrir (the garden of  contentment), of which mention has already been made, Munyatu-l-’a’miriyyah (the  garden of the Beni ’A’mir), and Munyatu-n-na’trah* (the garden of the water-wheel).   The poet Al-walid Ibn Zeydtn, in a poetical composition in which he enumerates  the palaces, gardens, and places of recreation which existed in Cordova in his time,  has preserved us the names of some, such as the Kasru-l-fdrist (the palace of the  Persian),*! and Merju-n-nadhtr (the golden meadow),‘? a pleasure-garden in the  outskirts of Cordova. There were, besides, various other villas, promenades, and  plantations, for the use and recreation of the inhabitants. Of this number seem to  have been Merju-l-khor (the meadow of the murmuring waters),‘* Fahssu-s-sorrdk  (the field of the thieves), and Fahssu-s-sudd (the field of the dam),** all places  which Ibnu Sa’id mentions on the authority of his father. The latter, that author  says, was the same as that known by the name of Fahssu-l-ardht (the field of the  mills), which is mentioned by Kasim Ibn ’Abtd Ar-riydhi.**   The river Guadalquivir is less at Cordova than at Seville, this being the reason  why stone bridges were thrown over it at the former place, while the latter had  none. This river has its origin in the mountains of Segura,‘? whence, dividing  itself into two streams, one flows eastwards to Murcia, the other to Cordova and  Seville. Ar-razi, describing this river, says that it flows as placidly as a stream of  milk, and that even when its waters are increased by rain it is, at Cordova, a most  harmless river ; not so at Seville, where it has often threatened destruction to the  city, and death to the inhabitants. The same’ author describes the bridge at  Cordova as one of the most magnificent structures in all Andalus. It consisted  of seventeen arches, each arch being fifty spans in width, and the intermediate space  between the arches being also fifty spans. According to Ibnu Hayyan it was built  by As-samh Ibn Malik Al-khaulanj, governor of Andalus ; or, as the author of the  Minhdju-l-fakr says, by his successor ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn ’Obeydillah Al-ghafeki,  at the instance of the Khalif ""Omar, son of ’Abdu-l-’aziz.4* It was afterwards  rebuilt and beautified by the Khalifs of the house of Merwdn. However, the",266,book_3,chapter_1
"    cHaP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 213    opinion given by Ibnu Hayy4n seems the most probable, namely, that there was an  old bridge at the same place, built about two hundred years before the invasion of  the Arabs ; but its arches being broken down and its upper works demolished by  time, only the foundations remaining, the governor As-samh ordered a new bridge  to be built in the year one hundred and one of the Hijra (a.p. 719-20), on the  still remaining piers of the former one. The length of this bridge is stated by Ibnu  Hayyén at eight hundred cubits, and the breadth at twenty; the elevation was  sixty cubits ; it stood upon eighteen arches (one more than Ar-rézi gave), and had  besides sixteen turrets. The old bridge is said by Ibnu Hayydn, Ar-razi, and  Al-hijari, to have been built by Octavius, the second Cesar of Rome, as we have  remarked elsewhere.   The number of villages and towns appertaining to Cordova was almost in- Jurstiction of  numerable, for at one time the jurisdiction of the capital extended over many  populous and wealthy districts. Some cities of the first rank likewise acknow-  ledged her authority; as Almodovar, distant sixteen miles; Mored, twenty-five ;  Alcozer, eighteen; Ghdfek, two days’ march; Ezija, thirty-six miles; Baena,  two days’ march ; Estepa, thirty-six miles: the city of Ronda belonged also to  Cordova, but it was afterwards annexed to that of Seville, to which city it stands  nearer. There were, moreover, in the neighbourhood of Cordova no less than three  thousand villages, provided with mosques, and having, besides, a divine (mukallass) ®  of known erudition, whose duty was to pronounce judgments on canon and civil  law. Among the Andalusian Arabs none could aspire to wear the kalass who could  not recite by heart most of the Mowattd, or who knew not ten thousand traditions  respecting the Prophet, or were not perfectly conversant with the theological work  entitled Al-madinah.©° It was the duty of the Kddis of villages in the neigh-  bourhood of Cordova to come to town every Friday, and assist at public prayers  with the Khalif in the great mosque; and when the prayers were over they all  approached the Sultan, saluted him, and reported on the state of their respective  towns.   The revenues arising from Cordova and. its district have been differently stated. Revenue.  They are said by an eastern writer to have amounted, in the days of Al-hakem, son  of Hisham, to one hundred and ten thousand and twenty dinars, in specie, four  thousand and seven hundred mudd of wheat and seven thousand seven hundred  and forty-seven of barley, in kind; another writer estimates them at three million  of dinars at a medium, under the administration of Al-manstr Ibn Abi ’A’mir.

But God only is all-knowing.   One thing is certain, namely, that trade and agriculture flourished in this place  during the reigns of the sons of Umeyyah in a degree which has scarcely been wit-  nessed in any other city in the world; its market was always overstocked with the  fruits of the land, the productions of every district, and the best of every country.  No robe, however costly,—no drug, however scarce,—no jewel, however precious,—  no rarity,of distant and unknown lands, but was to be procured in the bazaars of  Cordova, and found hundreds of purchasers. Situate as Cordova was in the midst of ©  fertile lands watered by the Guadalquivir, and which yielded abundant crops, its  inhabitants were at all times provided with the best food of all kinds, and that, too,  at the cheapest possible rate. Ibnu Sa’id calls the land about Cordova a favoured  land, and mentions several minerals in which its territory abounded, such as pure  silver in the district of Kartash,®' quicksilver and cinnabar in that of Sittdlisah,5?  and a great many other precious minerals. Another writer mentions a sort of stone  called sharankh,® which is well known to possess the property of stopping the blood  when applied to a wound, and which is said to have abounded in the territory of  that city. Our author observes that mule-loads of it were annually exported to  other countries, where it often fetched as high a price as five hundred dinars the  load, on account of its wonderful properties, which made it very much prized.   We have already said something elsewhere on the probable size and extent of  Cordova during the times of its greatest prosperity ; indeed it is ascertained that  during the administration of the Hajib Al-manstir such was the influx of popu-  lation, that, what with the innumerable foreigners who came from all parts of the  Mohammedan world to reside in it under the shade of his justice, and what with the  motley tribes of Berbers which he called from Africa, and with whom he reduced to  the last extremity the miserable relics of the Christian nations, the limits of Cor-  dova were found insufficient to contain them all, and many had to live encamped  under tents in the outskirts of the city. A trustworthy writer who was residing in  Cordova at the time tells us,—‘ I once counted all the houses in the city and  ‘its suburbs, and found they amounted to two hundred thousand and seventy-  “ seven, including only in this number those of the common people, artisans, and  “Jabourers ; for the palaces of the nobles, Wizirs, officers of the royal household,  “* commanders of the troops, and other wealthy citizens, and the barracks, hos-  “* pitals, colleges, and other public buildings, amounted to sixty thousand and three  “ hundred, exclusive of wooden cabins,® inns, baths, and taverns.” The number  of shops®® at this time is computed by the same author at eighty thousand four  hundred and fifty-five. Another writer states the number of markets to have been",268,book_3,chapter_1
"    CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 215    four thousand and three hundred, and says that within the walls of the citadel there  were upwards of four hundred and thirty houses belonging to officers of the royal  household and public functionaries. The number of houses in the city and the  suburbs belonging either to the common people or to respectable and wealthy  citizens is computed by the same writer at one hundred and thirteen thousand,  exclusive of the palaces inhabited by Wizirs, noblemen, and military commanders.  But we have read somewhere else that the said number must only be applied to the  times of the Sultans of the Beni Lamtumnah (Almoravides) and the Almohades their  successors, under whose reign the importance and splendour of Cordova were very  much diminished, owing to the disastrous civil wars which raged through its terri-  tory ; for, as we have remarked elsewhere, the number of houses occupied by officers  of the state and noble and distinguished citizens amounted to sixty thousand and  three hundred. The number of mosques in and without the capital is likewise stated  with great discrepancy. An ancient writer states those that existed under ’Abdu-r-  rahmén I. at four hundred and ninety ; it is true that this number was prodigiously*”  increased in the course of time. The author of the Kitdbu-l-mesdlek wa-l-memdlek  states them likewise at four hundred and seventy-one. We have seen their number  estimated even as high as eight hundred and thirty-seven,®* but this must be an  exaggeration ; the baths in and without the city are by some said to have amounted  to three hundred, by others they are computed at seven hundred. The suburbs  also are said to have been twenty-eight in number,—others reduce them to twenty ;  but the number given by Ibnu Bashkiwél, that is, twenty-one, occurs more fre-  quently in the writings of the time. :   However, the numbers as given by Ibnu Sa’id, a writer on whom we place the  most implicit trust and reliance, and who borrowed his information from Ibnu  Hayy4n and other historians who lived in the prosperous times of the Cordovan  Khalifate, are the following: one hundred and thirteen thousand houses for the  common people, besides half that number, or perhaps more, for the officers of the  state, favourites of the court, military commanders, and the like. The number of  mosques at the period of its greatest splendour, namely, during the administration  of the Wizir Ibn Abi ’A’mir, never exceeded seven hundred, nor the baths nine  hundred ; but he owns having read in an ancient history that under ’Abdu-r-  rahmén III. the city of Cordova was reported to contain three hundred thousand  houses, and eight hundred and eighty-seven mosques, eighteen of which were within  the limits of Shakandah ; yet the number given by Al-bekri (that is, four hundred  and seventy-seven mosques,) is still far from any of those before stated.

Tue great mosque of Cordova, as is well known, owes its erection to ’Abdu-r- ellie  rahman Ad-dakhel, the first sovereign of the house of Umeyyah who reigned Cordova.  independently over Andalus. All historians agree in saying that the moment  *Abdu-r-rahman saw himself free from rivals, and firmly established on his throne,   he began the building of the royal palace,—that of the pleasure-house called Rissdfah,   which we have before described,— and that of the great mosque. He died, however,  without seeing the building completed, and bequeathed to his son and heir, Hisham,   the care of the undertaking. Under this Sult4n the building was, properly speaking,  finished according to the original plan, but during the reign of the succeeding  Sultans and Khalifs, eight in number, who ruled over Andalus, it was considerably  augmented and embellished.   The causes which led to the erection of this magnificent temple are thus related Bullt on the ©  by the historian Ar-rézi. ‘‘ The conquerors of Andalus imitated the conduct of tian temple.  “Obeyd Ibnu-l-jerréh and Khdled Ibnu-l-walid' in dividing with the Christians  “the churches of the subdued cities, agreeably to the advice of the Khalif ""Omar  “ Tonu-l-khattéb.

According to this maxim, when the Arabs took  “Cordova they divided with the Christians their principal church, which was  “ within the city and close to the walls, and was known among them as the church  “ of St. Vincent.? In the moiety allotted to them the Moslems built themselves a  “* mosque for the prayers of the Friday, whilst the other half remained in the bands  VOL. I. 2F",271,book_3,chapter_2

Accordingly he sent for the chiefs of the  “ Christians, and proposed to purchase from them that part of the mosque which  “ remained still in their hands, in order that he might add it to the Mohammedan  ‘* pléce of worship. But notwithstanding the liberality of ’Abdu-r-rahman, who  “ offered them a very considerable sum of money, the Christians, relying on the  “ capitulations of peace signed to them by the conquerors, would not agree to sell  “their part. However, after much negotiation, they agreed to relinquish their own  “ half, on condition of being allowed to rebuild or repair another church outside the  ‘¢ walls, which had been destroyed, and of holding it independently of the Moslems, and  “ entirely consecrated to the worship of their God. This being granted by ’Abdu-r-  “ rahmén, and the Christians having received the sum agreed upon, which a certain  “ historian has stated at one hundred thousand dinars, the Sultén proceeded in the  “ year one hundred and sixty-eight* of the Hijra (a. p. 784-5) to demolish the old  ‘« place of worship, and to lay on it the foundations of the great mosque,’ which  “ became one of the wonders of the world. In this building, which was carried  “on with incredible activity during his reign, ’Abdu-r-rahmén is said to have  “spent the sum of eighty thousand dinars, derived from the fifth of the spoil.”  However, as we have remarked elsewhere, the building was not completed  until the days of his son Hisham, in the year one hundred and seventy-seven  of the Hijra (a. p. 793-4).   The poet Dihyah Mohammed Ibn Mohammed Al-balini® has alluded to this  in an excellent composition, of which we quote the following verses :",272,book_3,chapter_2
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 219    “ *Abdu-r-rahmén has spent, for the sake of his God and the honour of  “ religion, of silver and gold eighty thousand din4rs.   ‘* He has employed them in building a temple for the use of this devout  “ nation, and the better observance of the religion of the Prophet Mohammed.   “There thou wilt see the gold which covers its ceilings in profusion glitter  “« as brightly as the lightning crossing the clouds.”    —    Once completed by Hishém, the mosque of Cordova received considerable im- Continued by    provement at the hands of his successors ; indeed, it can be safely advanced that  none of the Sultans of the illustrious family of Umeyyah who reigned in Cordova  died without making some considerable addition, or contributing in some way to  the ornament of that sumptuous building. Hishém, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmén,  surnamed Ar-radhi, the same monarch who saw it completed, added considerably  to it, the expenses of the work being entirely defrayed out of the fifth of the  spoils taken from the infidels of Narbonne. His son, ’Abdu-r-rahmén al-ausatt  (the second), ordered the gilding of the columns and part of the walls,’ but died  before its termination. Mohammed, his successor, continued the work begun  by his father, and brought it to a close. His son, Al-mundhir, repaired several  rents in the walls, and made other material improvements in the building. The  Khalif An-ndssir caused the old minaret to be pulled down, and another magni-  ficent one to be erected in its stead. Al-hakem Al-mustanser-billah, son of  An-ndssir, made also important additions; seeing, on his coming to power, that  Cordova was every day increasing in size and extent, and the population rapidly  augmenting, and that notwithstanding the great additions made on various occasions  to the mosque it was still insufficient to hold the faithful that flocked to it on  Fridays, he directed all his attention to the enlargement of it, and succeeded after  great labour and expense in carrying his plan into execution and completing the  additional building known by his name ;—the expenses incurred by it having  amounted, according to the historian Ibnu Hayydn, to one hundred and sixty-one  thousand gold dinars, taken from the fifth of the spoils made from the infidels :—  by which the mosque reached the highest pitch of perfection, all these works being  executed in a manner which baffles all description. Lastly, in the reign of his  successor, Hishém II., and under the administration of his famous Hajib Ibn Abi  ’*Amir Al-mansir, a most important addition, built on a scale which left all those  of the Sultans, his predecessors, far behind in point of solidity, beauty of design,  and boldness of execution, was made to the body of the mosque.

The author of the Majmu’-l-muftarik® says that the roof of the aisles ® before the  addition made by Al-hakem measured two hundred and twenty-five cubits in length  from jauf to kiblah,' and that the breadth from east to west was likewise before    the addition one hundred and five cubits. Al-hakem then added one hundred and    five cubits, thus making the entire length of the mosque three hundred and thirty  cubits. After this, Mohammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir, better known by the surname  of Al-manstr, added to it by order of the Khalif Hisham, son of Al-hakem,  eighty cubits in breadth on the eastern side. The number of aisles was at first  eleven ; the breadth of the central one being sixteen cubits; that of each of the  two next, east and west, fourteen cubits; and that of each of the remaining six,  eleven cubits. To this number Al-mansir added eight aisles of ten cubits in  breadth each, the addition being completed in the space of two years and a half,  during which time Al-mansir himself occasionally worked in person. The length  of the court"" from east to west was one hundred and twenty-eight cubits, and the  breadth from kiblah to jauf one hundred and five ; the width of the porticos of the  colonnade surrounding the court was ten cubits ; and the area of the whole building  measured thirty-three thousand one hundred and fifty square cubits.   Tbnu Sa’id, quoting Ibnu Bashkiwél, agrees in some particulars with the above  account. He states the length of the great mosque within the city at the same  number of cubits, that is, three hundred and thirty from jauf to kiblah; the  court or open space he only makes eighty cubits in length, the remainder being  occupied by porticos tiled over. He estimates the breadth of the mosque from  east to west at two hundred and fifty cubits, in which he is at variance with  the preceding statement.’2 He says also that the total number of aisles, com-  prising the addition made by Al-mansiir, was nineteen, and that they were called  al-baldttdt. The number of doors, great and small, was twenty-one; namely,  nine on the west side, including in the number a large one by which women  entered into the part of the mosque allotted to them; nine on the east, eight  of which were for the men and one for the women; three to the north, of  which two large ones were for the use of the men, and the other for the women  to enter into their recesses. No doors were visible on the south side, with  the exception of one in the south side of the makssirah, and leading through  a covered way to the palace of the Khalif. It was through this secret passage  that the Sultan passed on a Friday into the mosque to join in the public worship.  All these doors were covered with the finest brass, in the most beautiful manner.'®",274,book_3,chapter_2
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 221    Another author describes the doors as being only nine; namely, three opening  into the court,—one to the east, another to the west, and a third to the north; four  opening into the aisles, namely, two on the east and two on the west side; the  two remaining leading into the recesses for women under the aisles: and lastly, an  anonymous writer’* whom we consulted in Cairo says that each of these doors  was ornamented with a ring of exquisite workmanship, and covered with sheets  of yellow brass so bright and polished as to dazzle the eyes of the beholders.   According to the author of the Majmu’-l-muftarik the number of columns, all ~~  of marble, is said to have been one thousand two hundred and ninety-three ;  according to another writer the total number of columns which either supported  the roof of the mosque, or were embodied in the walls, or formed the domes,  or entered into the building of the minaret, amounted between large and small  to one thousand four hundred and seventeen ; others say that the large columns  in the interior of the mosque amounted to one thousand, exclusive of others of  smaller size in the court and offices of the mosque; but there are not wanting  authors who make their number still more considerable. Ibnu Bashkiwél, quoted  by Ibnu Sa’id, states them to be in all fourteen hundred and nine,’ of which one  hundred and nineteen were comprised within the maksstrah, built by Al-mansir.  This the above-mentioned author describes as one of the most magnificent and  bold structures ever raised by man. It extended across five aisles of the  eleven composing the addition built by Al-hakem, and its wings passed through  the remaining six, leaving three on each side ;'° its length from east to west was  seventy-five cubits; its breadth from the wooden partition to the columns of the  kiblah twenty-two cubits; the height, counting from the floor to the cornices,’”  eight cubits ; and that of the cornices three spans.   This makssirah was further provided with three doors of exquisite workmanship Makssirah.  and beautifully carved, and leading by the east, west, and north, into the body of  the mosque. It is stated elsewhere that one of these doors was made of pure gold,  as well as the walls of the mihrdb ; '* that the floor of the makssiirah was paved  with silver, and that all the parts adjacent to it were covered with sofeysafd'® (rich  mosaic work intermixed with gold) ; and lastly, that most of the columns, which  are described as being placed in clusters of four, and having only one capital, were  most beautifully carved and inlaid from top to bottom with gold and lapis-lazuli ;  but God only is all-knowing. It is also asserted that in the open space” occupied  by the mihrdb there were seven arches supported by columns, and rising to a con-  siderable height ; and such was the beauty of their proportions and the boldness of  the execution that both Christians and Moslems repeatedly expressed their admi-  ration at the manner in which they were achieved: there were besides in the two",275,book_3,chapter_2

We learn from Ibnu Bashkiwél that the length of the mihrdb was eight cubits  and a half from kiblah to jauf, and its breadth from east to west seven cubits and  a half; the height of the dome thirteen cubits and a half. There stood against one  of its sides a pulpit,” also constructed by Al-hakem, and equalled by none other in  the world for workmanship and materials. It was built of ivory, and of the most  exquisite woods, such as ebony, sandal, bakam,® Indian plantain, citron wood,  aloe, and so forth, at the expense of thirty-five thousand seven hundred and five  dinars, three dirhems and one third ; and the steps by which it was ascended were  nine in number. Another writer says that it was formed of thirty-six thousand  small pieces of wood, which were fastened together with gold and silver nails, and  occasionally incrusted with precious stones, and that the original cost of each piece  was seven dirhems of silver ; that its construction lasted for seven years, eight artists  being daily employed in it, with an allowance of half a mithkél Mohammedi™ a day.   This pulpit was once the repository of a copy of the Koran written, as it is  generally supposed, by the Khalif ""Othman. It was preserved in a case of gold  tissue set with pearls and rubies, over which was a bag of the richest coloured silk,  the whole being placed on a stand of aloe wood, joined with gold nails. It was  taken to Africa by one of the Sulténs of the Beni ’Abdi-l-miimen, and lost and  recovered several times, until it was finally deposited in the great mosque called  Jémi’-Karawayin® (the mosque of the people of Cairw4n), at Fez. But this being  an interesting subject, and one which has given rise to much debate among the  learned, some of whom have expressed doubts of this book being so ancient  as it was supposed, we deem it proper to transcribe here the words of a very  intelligent author who has fully investigated the case. The Khattib Ibn Marzik*  says in his work entitled Al-masnadu-s-sahthu-l-hasan, (or collection of authen-  ticated traditions,) as follows:—‘‘ The copy of the Kordn called ’Othméni, and  “‘ which, according to Ibnu BashkiiwAl, is one of the four copies which the Khalif  “«’Othman (may God show him His favours !) sent to Mekka, Basrah, Kiifah, and  “* Damascus, is too well known all over Andalus and Africa to need description.  “ Tt was kept in the great mosque of Cordova, until on a Saturday, the eleventh of  “* Shawwal of the year five hundred and fifty-six of the Hijra (a.p. 1161), it was  ‘* taken away, as it is believed, by order of Abii Mohammed ’Abdu-l-mimen Ibn  “ °Ali,?7 and taken to Africa, where it remained in the hands of that Sult4n and his  ‘* successors, who not only took the greatest care of it, but carried it always in their    .“* travels and military expeditions, expecting that it would prove for them a source    ‘“‘ of prosperity. Thus it passed from one Sultan to another among the Almohades",276,book_3,chapter_2
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 223    “until it came to ’Ali Ibnu-l-maémin Abi-l-’ol4 Idris Ibnu-l-mansér, surnamed  “ Al-mu’atadhedh and Sa’id,* who took it with him in ms expedition against  “ Telemsfn, towards the end of the year six hundred and forty-five of the Hijra  “(a.p. 1247-8). By the death of this Sultan, who perished in a skirmish before  “ that city, the sacred volume went to his son Ibréhim,® who, having given battle  “ to the enemy, was also defeated and lost his life, the enemy getting possession of  “all the baggage of his army, and the greatest part of his treasures ; among which  “ was this Koran, which fell into the hands of the Arabs. What its final desti-  “nation was I could not learn; some say that it was acquired by the Sultan of  “ Telemsén, whose successor preserves it now in his treasure.   “ As to the supposition that some spots of the blood of *Othmén are to be seen  “on it, it is a very gratuitous one, and rests on no foundation whatever. That of  “ its being one of the copies presented by the Khalif to the cities of Mekka, Basrah,  “ Kufah, and Damascus, requires some consideration. Ibn ’Abdi-l-mdlik says, ‘ In  “ case of its being one of the above-mentioned copies, it cannot be any other than  “ the Syrian one.’ But Abd-l-késim An-najibi® As-sebtti tells us that the Syrian  “ copy, that is, the identical one presented by ’Othmén to the city of Damascus, is  “still preserved in the maksstirah of the mosque of the Beni Umeyyah in that  “city, where he saw it himself in the year six hundred and fifty-seven of the  “ Hijra.' It cannot either be that of Mekka, for the same Abi-l-k4sim informs us  “ that having in the said year of six hundred and fifty-seven (a.p. 1259) made his  “ pilgrimage to the holy places, he saw and read in it, and found it lying as before  “under the dome of the Jews, otherwise called Kubbatu-t-tarab (the dome of the  “ dust), and that he likewise saw the ancient copy preserved at Medina, and read in  “it. Perhaps it is the one of Kiifah, or that of Basrah ; but it is well known that  “the latter is preserved at Medina, where Abi-l-k4sim found it. Besides, An-  “ najaghi,°? who in the year seven hundred and five (a.p. 1305-6) had an oppor-  “tunity of seeing and comparing both copies, namely, that which is preserved in  “ Medina, and that which came to this country and was previously in the great  “mosque of Cordova, declares positively that he examined them both with the  “ greatest attention and care, and saw nothing which could lead him to suppose  “that the Cordovan one was of the same antiquity. The hand-writing was totally  “ distinct, the copy at Medina being written in the hand-writing generally used in  “Yemen, while that of Cordova was not. As to its being written by the Khalif  “?Othmaén himself, it is a supposition which scarcely needs refutation, for it is  “known to every body that he wrote none himself; what he did was merely to  “ intrust some of the companions of the Prophet with the revision and arrangement  “ of a copy which should serve as a standard for all others,—this being proved by",277,book_3,chapter_2

Then follow the names of the companions who assisted in the collection, as  “ Zeyd Ibn Thabit, Abdullah Ibn Zubeyr, Sa’id Al-’assi, and so forth.   “* However, be this as it may, one thing is-certain, namely, that the copy of the  “ Koran which was preserved at Cordova, and held in so great veneration by the  ‘* people of Andalus, passed through many hands, until it was lost before Telemsén  “by the Sult4én Ibr4him; its present destination being totally unknown to me,  “‘ unless, I repeat, it be preserved in the treasure of the Sultan of Telemsdn, as it  “* has been reported.”   Such is Ibn Marziik’s account, which we have copied almost literally from his  work. Now it remains for us to say that what Ibn Marzik conjectures is a fact ;  the sacred volume here alluded to remained in the possession of the Sultdéns of Te-  lemsan, who transmitted it as an inheritance from father to son, until that city was  taken by our Imém Abi-l-hasan™ towards the end of Ramadhan of the year seven  hundred and thirty-seven of the Hijra (a. p. 1336). That prince, having seized  upon all the treasures contained in the royal palace, found among other valuable  objects the famous Kordn, which he kept in his possession until it was again lost by  him in the disastrous battle of Tarifa ;*° thus becoming the prey of the infidel  monarchs of Andalus. From that country it went to Portugal, whence it was again  recovered in the year seven hundred and forty-five (a. p. 1344-5) by one of the  merchants of Azamor, who employed a ruse to gain possession of it. It then was  acquired by the Sultan of Fez, at which city Ibn Rashid saw it, as he himself  informs us in his travels.*   But to return to our description of the mosque of Cordova. ‘‘ The height of the  “ tower?’ now existing,” says Ibnu Bashkiwal, ‘‘ which was built by the Sultén  “*Abdu-r-rahman, son of the Sultén Mohammed, is seventy-two cubits, namely,  “* fifty-four to the top of the open dome, towards which the crier turns his back  “‘ when proclaiming the hour of prayers, and eighteen more to the very end of the  “spar. On the summit of this dome are the three celebrated apples, two of which  ‘“‘are made of pure gold, and the middle one of silver. Each of them measures  ‘ three spans and a half in circumference, and they are encompassed within two six-  “* petalled lilies in a most elegant manner, the whole being surmounted by a small  “ pomegranate made of pure gold, rising about a cubit above the top of the dome,  “‘ which is considered one of the wonders of the world.”   The building of this tower is thus related by the above-mentioned writer. ‘ In  ** the year three hundred and thirty-four® (a. p. 945-6) the Amir ’Abdu-r-rahmdn",278,book_3,chapter_2

When the whole building was completed, An-ndssir rode to the  “spot from his palace in the city of Az-zahr4, where he was residing at the time,  ‘‘ ascended to the top of the tower by one of its staircases, and came down by  “ the other ; for unlike the old tower, which had only one staircase, the present one  ‘is provided with two, separated by a wall of masonry, and so contrived that two  “ people starting at the same time may arrive at the top without meeting or seeing  “each other. After carefully inspecting the edifice, An-ndssir went into the  “ maksstirah of the mosque, prayed two reka’s, and retired.”   The number of steps in each staircase was one hundred and seven; and Ibnu  Bashktwal adds, that it was firmly believed in his time that the tower had not  its equal in point of height and beauty in any other of the countries subject to the  rule of Islam. But, as Ibnu Sa’id has very properly remarked, had Ibnu Bashkiwél  seen those of Seville and Morocco, both built by the Sultan Ya’kib Al-mansir, one  of the Beni ’Abdi-l-miimen, he would not have said so, since it is well known that  their dimensions considerably exceed those of the tower of Cordova. The height of  this, measured from below to the balcony or balustrade where the crier stands, is  fifty-four cubits, and to the very extremity of the spar, where the gold pomegranate  is, seventy-three cubits ; the width of each of the square sides, eighteen cubits ;—  thus making seventy-two cubits in circuit. The height of the tower at Morocco  is well known to be one hundred and ten cubits, and the width in proportion.   The expenses incurred by An-nassir in his addition to the mosque, as well as in  the construction of this tower, are stated by Ibnu Bashkiwal, who borrowed his  information from an account in the hand-writing of the Khalif himself,° at two  hundred and sixty-one thousand five hundred and thirty-seven dinérs, and two  dirhems and a half.   His son, Al-hakem, was no less fond of building, and his improvements and  additions to the mosque rank as high as those of any of his predecessors. As we  have related elsewhere, Al-hakem, soon after his accession to the throne, thought  of enlarging the mosque of Cordova, which had become too small to contain the  crowds of people that flocked to it on Fridays. While the addition was being built,  a dispute arose among his architects respecting the part of the horizon towards  which the kiblah was to be turned; some pretending that it ought to be built  facing the south, as it was formerly, and as his father, An-ndssir, had done with that   VOL.

While the people were  thus disputing the point among themselves, the Faquih Abi Ibrahim came up to  Al-hakem, and said to him, ‘‘ O Prince of the believers! all the people of this  ‘ nation have constantly turned their faces to the south while making their prayers ;  “ it was to the south that the Im4ms who preceded. thee, the doctors, the Kadis, and  “ all Moslems, directed their looks, from the times of the conquest up to the present  ‘‘ day; and it was to the south that the tdbi’s, like Misa Ibn Nosseyr and Hansh  “* As-san’dni, (may God show them mercy !) inclined the kiblahs of all the mosques  “ which they erected in this country. Remember that proverb which says, ‘ It is  “* preferable to follow the example of others and be saved, than to perish by  “ separating from the track.’” Upon which the Khalif exclaimed, ‘‘ By Allah,  “ thou sayst right! I am for following the example of the tdbi’s, whose opinion on  “ the subject is of great weight :”——and he ordered that it should be executed as  proposed.   Nor was this the only improvement which the Khalif Al-hakem made to the  great mosque ; he ordered, besides, some works of the greatest utility and import-  ance. Instead of the old reservoir*® for purification, in the court of the mosque,  which was supplied with water drawn by beasts*' from a neighbouring well, he built  four others at the two sides of the mosque, viz., two large ones for men at the eastern  angle, and two small ones for women at the western ; and these he filled by means  of a canal,‘? which, taking the water from the foot of the mountains of Cordova,  poured it into an immense reservoir lined with marble. The water ran night and  day, and what remained after supplying the wants of the mosque, being very sweet  and of excellent quality, was distributed into three canals,* parting from three  different sides of the mosque, east, north, and west, and flowed into two immense  fountains,“* which Al-hakem caused to be hewn out of the solid rock at the foot of  the mountains of Cordova at an enormous expense, owing to the number of work-  men employed in them, and the difficulty of transport.   The work was executed in the following manner :—Two immense blocks of stone  were first selected from the quarries in the mountains of Cordova; they were then  hewn out with pickaxes, an operation which took up considerable time, and when  every thing was completed both fountains appeared suddenly to the eyes of the  astonished multitude in the shape which they were destined to have. However,  the general satisfaction expressed by the inhabitants on this occasion was very  much damped by the obstacles, to all appearance insurmountable, which the distance  of the quarry and the size of the blocks presented to the transport and conveyance  of them by an inclined plane to the corners of the mosque prepared for their recep-",280,book_3,chapter_2
"    cuaP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 227    tion. This, however, was soon remedied, through the assistance of Almighty God,  and the following expedient was suggested. A cart was built with large beams  of oak wood placed upon a circular frame, the whole being strengthened with iron  hoops ; a road was levelled from the quarry to the mosque, and after every prepara-  tion had been made seventy of the strongest draught oxen were yoked to it by  means of strong ropes, and with God’s favour and assistance the two huge blocks  reached their destination one after the other, and were placed in the vaulted recesses  prepared for them,**—twelve consecutive days being the time spent in their  transport.    On the west side of this mosque Al-hakem built a house for the distribution of Ats-houses.    alms, in which such poor travellers and people as lost their way in the city, or did  not know whither to go, or were devoid of sufficient means to provide for their  wants during their residence in the capital, met always with a charitable reception,  and were hospitably entertained and furnished with every necessary, owing to the  vast sums with which the establishment was endowed by the Khalif. Several houses  for the poor were likewise erected by Al-hakem over against the great western gate  of the mosque.“® The sum spent by Al-hakem in the building of these houses, as  well as in his addition to the mosque, &c., amounted, according to Ibnu Hayyén, to  one hundred and sixty-one thousand gold dinérs, all derived from the fifths of the  spoil.   But the greatest addition that ever was made to the mosque is undoubtedly that  undertaken and completed in the days of Hishém II., and under the administration  of his famous Hajib, Al-mansir Ibn Abi ’A’mir. It is thus described by Ibnu Sa’id,  who quotes Ibnu Bashkiwél and Ibnu-l-faradhi as his authorities‘ The popula-  “tion of Cordova had so much increased,—owing to the great influx of people who  “came from all parts of Asia and Africa to settle in it, and to the tribes of Berbers  “‘ which Al-mansir drew from the opposite land and kept in his pay ;—the city  “itself had reached to such a pitch of magnificence and splendour,’ that the  “ suburbs and outskirts teemed with inhabitants, and the great mosque was found  “incapable of holding the faithful who flocked to it from all sides. As the  “Khalifs palace adjoined the mosque on the west side, Al-mansir could not  “extend the building except on the east. The first step he took was to indemnify,  “* preparatory to the building, the proprietors of such houses as were to be pulled  “ down with such sums as they chose to fix for their property. He called together  “ the owners of the houses, and addressing each of them in private he spoke thus :  “* Friend, I want that house of thine; I must buy it from thee, that I may add  “ its site to that of the great mosque: it is a work of great utility, and intended  “ for the convenience of the public. Thou mayst ask whatever price thou choosest    Al-mansiir's  addition.",281,book_3,chapter_2
"    Number of  chandeliers in  the mosque.    228 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    “* to have for it, and it shall be paid to thee out of the royal coffers.’ Every one  “* of the proprietors having agreed to sell his house, not without putting the highest  “* possible price on it, Al-manstir gave immediate orders for the payment, and com-  ‘* manded besides that a suitable residence should be built for each of the pro-  ‘* prietors in another quarter of the city. Al-mansiir addressed himself at length to  ‘* an old woman, who, being the proprietor of a house with a palm tree within the  “ court of the mosque,** obstinately refused to part with it for any sum, unless she  ‘* were provided with another house having also a palm tree; upon which Al-  ‘‘manstr issued immediate orders that the old woman’s wish should be fulfilled,  “* should it cost a beyt-mdl ;*° and, accordingly, another house with a palm tree was  ‘* procured for a most exorbitant price.   ‘* All these difficulties being speedily removed, Al-manstir began to build  ‘his addition, in aisles extending all along the mosque, as we have remarked  ‘* elsewhere,*° and the whole, when finished, presented a front of the greatest  ‘* solidity and elegance, the interior being decorated with gold in the most mag-  “ nificent manner; so that in the opinion of all the intelligent in these matters  “the addition built by Al-mansiir fell nowise short of those of any of his pre-  ‘‘ decessors, that of Al-hakem even not excepted :—the action being rendered still  “‘ more meritorious by the circumstance of Christian slaves*' from Castile and other  ‘ infidel countries working in chains at the building instead of the Moslems, thus  “ exalting the true religion and trampling down polytheism. Al-mansir built also  “ the great cistern under the court of the mosque,®? and it was he who first caused  ‘“« wax to be burnt in the interior in addition to oil, thus combining the effect of  “ both lights.”   The number of brazen chandeliers, of different sizes, in the.mosque, is computed  by some at two hundred and eighty, and by others at two hundred and twenty-four,  without counting those over the gates; and the number of cups containing the oil  at seven thousand four hundred and twenty-five, or according to other accounts at  ten thousand eight hundred and five. The leaden supporters® for the cups  weighed four arrobes, and three-fourths of a kintar* of cotton for the wicks of  the lamps were consumed each month of Ramadhén. The annual consumption of  oil amounted to one hundred and twenty-five kintars, half of which was used during  the Ramadhan ; and in this holy month three kintars of wax, and three-quarters of  a kintar of cotton thread used in preparing the wax, were requisite over and above  the usual allowance. The great wax taper which burned by the side of the Imém  weighed from fifty to sixty pounds ; it burned night and day throughout the month  of Ramadhan, and its materials both of wax and wick were so contrived that the  whole might be consumed on the last night of Ramadhén. The chandeliers were",282,book_3,chapter_2
"    CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 229    all made of brass and of different patterns, with the exception of three which were  of silver. Four greater than the rest were suspended in the central aisle; the  largest, which was of enormous dimensions, hung from the ceiling of the dome over  that part of the mosque where the Koréns were kept, and consisted, according to a  certain writer, of one thousand four hundred and fifty-four cups for lights. How-  ever, these large chandeliers, each of which consumed nightly seven arrobes or  quarters of a kintar of oil, were only lighted in the last ten days of the month of  Ramadhan. The total expenditure of oil in all the lamps® about the mosque,  including the addition built by Al-manstir, is by another writer estimated at one  thousand arrobes, or two hundred and fifty kintars, of which seven hundred and  fifty were consumed in the month of Ramadhén.   Tbnu Sa’id, who borrowed most of his information from Ibnu Bashktwél, gives  an estimate somewhat different from that of the former writers we have quoted,  although it nearly agrees with that of the latter. He says that the annual expen-  diture was one thousand and thirty arrobes of oil, (two hundred and fifty-one kintars  and one quarter,) five hundred of which were spent during Ramadhan, and that the  three silver chandeliers required seventy-two pounds weight of oil nightly, that is to  say, twenty-four each ; that the largest of all the lamps measured fifty spans in cir-  cumference, and held one thousand four hundred and eighty cups, the whole of which  were washed over with gold. Ibnu Sa’id being an author more deserving of credit  than any other of those who have written on the subject, not only on account of  the sources from which he derived his information, but also on account of his  veracity as an historian, we do not hesitate to adopt his computation. But God  only knows.*®   The number of people employed in or about the mosque, as the Im4m, the Attendants.  readers of the Korén, wardens, door-keepers, proclaimers of the hours of prayer,  lamp-lighters, and the like, is said to have been, in the days of Al-mansir, one  hundred and fifty-nine; but Ibnu Bashkiwa4l, whose account is entitled to more  credit, says that the attendants of all classes amounted to three hundred in the  times of the Khalifs,*” as well as under the administration of the Hajib Al-mansir.  He adds likewise that four ounces of ambergris, and eight of fresh aloe wood, were  burnt by way of incense on the last day of the month of Ramadhdn, although  Ibnu-l-faradhi, an author also entitled to great credit, states that one pound of  wood of aloes, and a quarter of a pound of amber, were allowed every Friday for a  similar purpose.   Our readers must have observed some discrepancy in the dimensions of this  Mosque, as well as in the number of columns, pillars, and chandeliers which it  is said to have contained, but this is owing either to the inequality of the measure",283,book_3,chapter_2

In abridging the accounts of the various authors who have treated  on this mosque, we may have been guilty of repetition, yet, as we consider that  information may have been increased by it, and that we have been useful, this will  easily atone for our faults. God is great! in Him we place our trust !   ‘We cannot leave the description of this sumptuous building, and the enumeration  of the wonders of art contained in it, without taking notice of two or three circum-  stances which we have seen mentioned in Eastern authors, and which it may be  important to know, although no good authority is given for them. It is a current  opinion in Damascus, as well as in other cities of the East, that the mosque of  Cordova had three hundred and sixty arches, according to the number of days in the  year, and that the sun passed every day by one of the arches until it went round the  whole number, when it returned in the inverse direction.*® Among the authors that  we have quoted none has alluded to this; nay, we will say more, among the almost  innumerable Andalusian as well as African writers who have treated on this mosque,  none, that we know of, has made the least allusion to it; therefore the account,  from whoever it comes, is entitled to no credit ; for, we ask, is it probable that so  extraordinary a circumstance should have been passed in silence by writers who  have recorded facts of much less importance with the most scrupulous details ?   The author of the Nashaku-l-azhdr®® (sweet odour of the flowers) says that  among the manifold objects which by their exquisite workmanship or their costly  materials attracted the eyes of the beholder in the mosque of Cordova, there were  three red marble pillars, on which were engraved,—on one the name of Mohammed,  on the other Moses’ rod and the sleepers of the cave, and on the third Noah’s  crow ; and that the columns were not the work of man, but made by God, just as  they were. We again confess that we have looked in vain for information re-  specting this wonderful production of nature ; in vain have we perused and consulted  the best authenticated accounts of the time, and the most detailed description of the  mosque ; we have nowhere found the least mention made of it: we must therefore  pronounce it improbable ; for is it natural that the best and most diligent among  ancient writers should have omitted the fact, and that if the name of our holy  Prophet had been found impressed by the hand of the Almighty on one of the  columns of the temple this miraculous circumstance should have been left un-  noticed? But God is all-knowing.   There is still another circumstance told of the mosque of Cordova which we must",284,book_3,chapter_2
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 231    mention. It is recorded by that eminent writer, Ibnu Bashkiwaél, whose narrative  we have used so often ; but, being as devoid of foundation as the preceding, no great  reliance can be placed on it. That author introduces among his traditional stories  respecting Cordova the following :—‘‘ And they say that the site occupied by the  “ great mosque was formerly a great hollow, wherein the inhabitants used to throw  “ their offal, but that when Suleyman, son of Datid, (on whom be peace !) came to  “ Cordova and saw the spot, he said to the Jinn, ‘ Clear away this place for me,  “and transform it into a suitable ground, that you may afterwards build on it a  “temple for the worship of the Almighty God;’ and that the orders were obeyed,  “and the mosque built.” But this is contradictory of what we have stated elsewhere  respecting the Christian church, which, in the opinion of all writers, and of Ibnu  Bashktiw4l himself, stood on the site now occupied by the great mosque. The  same writer states that all the uniform ovals which are engraved on the ceiling of  the great mosque bore inscriptions appropriate to the spot, and calling the mind of  the faithful to contemplation and devotion.”   But let us proceed to the description of other magnificent buildings which em-  bellished the court of the Khalifs ; and first of all to that of the city of Az-zahra,  built by ’Abdu-r-rahmdén An-ndssir lidin-illah, the seventh Sultan of the dynasty of  Beni Umeyyah in Andalus.",285,book_3,chapter_2

City and pa- THe cause of the building of the city of Az-zahré is thus related by a certain doctor,  lace of Az- FI . UG : .   zahré. a native of Cordova. One of An-nassir’s concubines happening to die possessed of   considerable wealth, the Sultan ordered that the whole of her property should be   spent in the redemption of captives. A search was accordingly made in the country   of the Franks, but not one Moslem captive could be found; upon which An-ndssir   was greatly delighted, and thanked God for it. His mistress Az-zahraé, whom he   Cause of ite loved passionately, then said to him,—‘ Build with that money a city that may   "" “ take my name and be'mine:” and in compliance with her wish An-ndssir, who   surpassed his ancestors ’Abdu-r-rahman al-ausatt and Al-hakem I. in fondness for   building, began building at the foot of the mountain called Jebalu-l-’aris (the   mountain of the bride), south of the mountain and north of Cordova, the palace   and city which he called Medinatu-z-zahra after his mistress. This city, which   at first was only intended as a spot of recreation for his mistress, An-ndssir soon   took for his residence, making it also the abode of his guards and the officers   of his household; he built the palace of solid materials’ and beautiful design, and   ornamented the interior with costly magnificence, and he ordered also that a statue   of his mistress should be carved in relief over the gate. They say that when   Az-zahra sat for the first time in the great hall of the palace, and, looking out of   the windows, gazed with admiration on the beautiful snow-white buildings of the   city, contrasting with the black and dismal appearance of the mountain at the foot   of which it stood, she said to her royal spouse, ‘‘ See, O master ! how beautiful this   “* girl looks in the arms of yonder Ethiopian ;” on hearing which An-nassir gave   immediate orders for the removal of the mountain, but one of his counsellors   happening to be present when the order was issued said to him, ‘‘ O Prince of   “* the believers! God forbid that thou shouldst undertake a task the mere idea   “of which is sufficient to make a man lose his wit, for were all the men upon    ?",286,book_3,chapter_3
"    CHAP. I11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 233    “the face of the earth to be employed in cutting away its trees and excavating  “ its sides, no human force could move it from where it now stands. He only can  “do it who is the creator of all things.” This reason convinced An-néssir of  the impossibility of the task, and he ordered instead that all the oak and other  mountain trees which grew on it should be rooted up, and that fig and almond  trees should be planted in their place; by which change the landscape was so  much improved that the mountain became one of its finest ornaments, principally  in the spring, when the trees, being in full blossom, spread in the atmosphere a  fragrance and freshness that were quite delightful.   Medinatu-z-zahré was thus situate between the foot of the mountain and the  plain which extends to Cordova, at the distance of about three miles from the  furthest limits of the city. Ibn Khallekén, in his biography of illustrious men,  under the article of Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbdd, King of Seville, has given the dimen-  sions of this wonderful city: his words are as follow. ‘“ The city of Az-zahré  “was one of the most splendid, most renowned, and most magnificent structures  “ever raised by man. It stood at the distance of four miles and a third from  “ Cordova; it measured two thousand seven hundred cubits in length from east  “ to west, and the breadth from north to south was one thousand seven hundred  “cubits. The number of columns in the building amounted to four thousand  “three hundred, and that of the doors to fifteen thousand.' In the raising of  “this sumptuous building An-n4ssir lavished countless treasures, since it is  “ reported that the revenues of Andalus, in the days of this Sult4n, amounted  “to five millions four hundred and eighty thousand gold dinars, collected from  “taxes; besides seven hundred and sixty-five thousand derived from markets:  “ exclusive also of the fifth of the spoil taken from the enemy, and the capitation  “ tax levied on Christians and Jews living in the Moslem dominions, the amount  “of which is said to have equalled all the rest. Of this vast income An-ndssir  “appropriated one-third to the payment of the army, one-third was deposited in  “ the royal coffers to cover the expenses of his household, and the remainder was  “spent yearly in the construction of Az-zahra and such other buildings as were  “ erected under his reign.” ? Such are the words of Ibn Khallek4n, who derived  his information from Ibnu Bashkiwél and other Andalusian historians.   Others assert that the expenditure was as follows. The number of workmen  and slaves daily labouring at the building was ten thousand ;—the number of mules  and other beasts of burden® constantly employed in the transport of the materials  fifteen hundred, or, according to others, fourteen hundred mules and four  hundred camels belonging to the Khalif, and one thousand mules hired for the  occasion, at the rate of three mithkals a month each. Eleven hundred burdens   VOL. I. 2n    Expenditare.",287,book_3,chapter_3
"    Materials used  in its erection.    234 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book m1.    of lime and gypsum were conveyed every third day for the use of the building.  The daily pay of one part of the men was one dirhem and a half each, others  received two dirhems and one-third. Six thousand blocks of stone made com-  pletely even and smooth were used every day, without including in this number  the uncut stones, bricks, and the like.   But as we are indebted to the historian Ibnu Hayydn for a minute description of  this magnificent construction, as also for an account of the materials used in the  building and the expenditure incurred by it, we shall extract its contents. It  is but proper to observe that this excellent historian held his information from  the mouth of Ibn Dahin, who had it from Moslemah Ibn ’Abdillah the architect  and geometrician, who lived in the reign of An-ndssir. ‘‘ An-ndssir began the  “ construction of the palace and city of Az-zahré in the year three hundred and  “ twenty-five of the Hijra (a. p. 936-7), and the building was continued for  “ forty consecutive years, that is to say, twenty-five years of the life of An-ndssir  ‘* and fifteen of that of his son and successor, Al-hakem ; for although the palace  ‘“‘ was completed long before the death of An-nassir, considerable additions were  ‘made to it by his son, and the buildings for the reception of the court, the  “barracks for the troops, the pleasure-gardens, baths, fountains, and so forth,  “were never completed until the days of Al-hakem. During the reign of ’Ab-  “du-r-rahman six thousand blocks of stone, great and small, cut into various  “ shapes, and either polished or smoothed, were used every day, exclusive of the  “uncut stones used for paving‘ and the like. The number of beasts of burden  ‘« daily employed to convey the materials of construction was fourteen hundred,  ‘* some say more, besides four hundred camels belonging to the Sultén, and one  ‘thousand mules hired for the occasion at the rate of three mithkals a month,  “* making the total expense of hiring amount to three thousand mithkals monthly.    ' “Jn the building eleven hundred burdens of lime and gypsum were used every    “third day. The number of columns, great and small, supporters or supported,  ‘employed in the building amounted to four thousand ; others exceed that  “number by three hundred and sixteen. Of these some came from Rome,,’  “‘ nineteen from the country of the Franks,’ one hundred and forty were pre-  “sented by the emperor of Constantinople, one thousand and thirteen, mostly  ‘* of green and rose coloured marble, were brought from Carthage, Tunis, Isfakis  ‘« (Sfax), and other places in Africa ; the remainder were extracted from quarries in  “his Andalusian dominions, as for instance the white marble from Tarragona and  “ Almeria, the streaked marble® from Raya, and so forth. I was told by Ibn  “« Dahin, who had it from the son of one of the architects employed by An-ndssir,  ‘that the persons commissioned to transport the marbles from Africa were three,",288,book_3,chapter_3
"    CHAP. I11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 235    “ namely, Abdullah the inspector of the works, Hasan Ibn Mohammed, and ’Ali  “ Ton Ja’far, a native of Alexandria, hesides Ibn Yiinis the sailor, and that An-ndssir  “paid them for every block or pillar of marble, whether great or small, which  “they transported to Cordova, ten gold dinars. I have likewise from good  “authority that the cost of each block of marble, whether great or small, found  “in the mountains of Andalus was also nearly the above-mentioned sum; and,  “lastly, it has been repeated on the authority of one of the servants of the  “palace that the total amount of the expenses in the erection of Az-zahra  “amounted yearly to three hundred thousand dinars during the twenty-five  “ years it was building under An-ndssir, namely, from the year three hundred and  “ twenty-five, the epoch of its commencement, till that of three hundred and fifty,  “the time of the death of that Khalif; and that having made the computation  “of the total expenditure which that Sultén underwent he found it amount to  “ fifteen beyt-mdl.?’ The number of doors in the palace of Az-zahré amounted  “to fifteen thousand, counting each flap or fold as one, and all were covered  “ either with plates of iron or sheets of polished brass.” So far Ibnu Hayyén.  Another well informed writer says that the cost of every block of marble brought  to Cordova, either from the Khalif’s dominions in Andalus as well as in Africa, or  from various distant countries in the hands of the infidels, was ten gold dinars  each, exclusive of the expenses of detachment from the quarry and carving, and  exclusive also of the cost of the men and beasts employed in the transport. And  another writer asserts that the total amount of expenses in building the city of  Az-zahr4 was one hundred mudd full of dirhems of the measure used at Cordova ;  others say eighty mudd and seven kaftz of the same measure.® But as these authors  do not state whether this is to be understood merely of the constructions raised  in An-néssir’s time, or also of those continued by his son Al-hakem, no great  reliance can be placed on the calculations, especially when we consider the au-  thenticity of the sources whence Ibnu Hayy4n borrowed the preceding narrative.  But before proceeding any further we deem it necessary again to remind the  reader of the system of composition we have adopted for the present work, and  which renders it necessary that we should quote literally from the writings of  authors from every country and of every age, thereby falling at every step into  fastidious repetitions and unavoidable contradictions; for since it is not given to  every author to see things in their true light, or to select the best information,  some have themselves been led into error, and made hundreds fall after them,  while others are to this day like a bright lamp which guides the studious through  the intricate maze of antiquity.

"    236 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    our information, have preferred this method of writing history; sometimes quoting  the very words, and at other times extracting the narrative, of authors, but seldom  introducing observations of our own, unless the contradiction be so glaring, or the  statement so uncommon, as to require it. We hope therefore that our reasons  for doing so will be justly appreciated, and that our readers will excuse us when-  ever we happen to fall into the above-mentioned errors.   The two foun- Among the wonders of Az-zahr4, says Ibnu Hayy4n, were two fountains, with a  their basins, so extraordinary in their shape, and so valuable for their exquisite  workmanship, that, in the opinion of that writer, they constituted the principal  ornament of the palace. The larger of the two, which was of gilt bronze, and  most beautifully carved with basso-relievo representing human figures, was brought  to the Khalif from Constantinople by Ahmed Al-yiindni (the Greek), and Rabi’ the  Bishop.'° As to the small one, which was of green marble, it was brought from  Syria by the said Ahmed, although others assert that it came likewise from  Constantinople with Rabi’. However, all agree in saying that such were the  taste of the designs on these fountains, and the magnificence of the materials,  as to make their value almost beyond estimation. The smaller one, above all,  appears to have been a real wonder of art. It was brought from place to place  until it reached the sea shore,"" when it was put on board a vessel and conveyed  to Andalus. When the Khalif received it he ordered it to be placed in the dor-  mitory of the eastern hall called Al-minis,7 and he fixed on it twelve figures  made of red gold, and set with pearls and other precious stones. The figures,  which were all made in the arsenal’ of Cordova, represented various animals ;  as for instance one was the likeness of a lion, having on one side an antelope,  and on the other a crocodile; opposite to these stood an eagle and a dragon ;  and on the two wings of the group a pigeon, a falcon,* a peacock, a hen, a  cock, a kite,'® and a vulture. They, moreover, were all ornamented with jewels,  and the water poured out from their mouths.   The hall of the Another of the wonders of Az-zahré was the hall called Kasru-l-kholafé (the hall  of the Khalifs), the roof of which was of gold and solid but transparent blocks of  marble of various colours, the walls being likewise of the same materials. In the  centre of this hall, or, according to some, on the top of the above-described foun-  tain, which is by them placed in this hall, was fixed the unique pearl presented to  An-nassir by the Greek emperor Leo,'* among other valuable objects. The tiles  that covered the roof of this magnificent hall were made of pure gold and silver,  and, according to Ibnu Bashkiwdl, there was in the centre of the room a large  basin filled with quicksilver; on each side of it eight doors fixed on arches’” of  ivory and ebony, ornamented with gold and precious stones of various kinds, resting",290,book_3,chapter_3
"    CHAP. I11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 237    upon pillars of variegated marble and transparent crystal. When the sun pene-  trated through these doors into the apartment, so strong was the action of its  rays upon the roof and walls of this. hall that the reflection only was sufficient to  deprive the beholders of sight. And when An-ndssir wished to frighten any of the  courtiers that sat with him, he had only to make a sign to one of his Sclavonians to  set the quicksilver in motion,!® and the whole room would look in an instant as if  it were traversed by flashes of lightning ; and the company would begin to tremble,  thinking that the room was moving away,—this sensation and their fears continuing  as long as the quicksilver was in motion. The abundance of quicksilver in Spain  made An-ndssir conceive the idea of employing it in the manner above described ;  and it was perhaps the effect produced by that mineral which led to the belief that  this hall was perpetually turning round and followed the course of the sun, or, as  others have it, that it moved round on the reservoir as on a pivot ;? and such  was An-ndssir’s care for this building that he would commit the superintendence of  it to none other but to his son and successor, Al-hakem. In one thing, however,  we find all authors agree, namely, that there never was built a more splendid hall  than this, either in the times preceding Isl4m or afterwards.   The mosque of'Az-zahré did not fall short of the rest of the building. Although Mosque in A:-  matchless in design and faultless in proportion, the whole structure was raised and  its interior arrangements completed in the space of forty-eight days, for An-ndssir  kept continually employed on it one thousand skilful workmen; of which three  hundred were masons, two hundred carpenters, and the remaining five hundred  bricklayers and mechanics of different kinds. It was a stupendous structure, most  beautifully finished in all its parts, and consisted of five aisles of wonderful fabric,  measuring thirty cubits® in length from kiblah to jauf, without the makssirah ;  the breadth of the central aisle was thirteen cubits from east to west, and that of  each of the remaining ones was twelve cubits. The whole building measured in  length from kiblah to jauf, exclusive of the makssirah, thirty cubits. The length  of the open court, from kiblah to jauf, was forty-three cubits, the whole of this  space being paved with marble flags of a reddish hue, very much resembling the  colour of wine. In the centre of this court stood a fountain which -poured out  limpid water for the use of the mosque. The entire length of the mosque from  kiblah to jauf, exclusive of the mihrdb, was ninety-seven cubits, and the breadth  from east to west fifty-nine. To this mosque was added a square tower, measuring  ten cubits at the base, and rising to the height of forty cubits. In the makssirah,  which was of wonderful construction and ornamented with costly magnificence, a  pulpit of extraordinary beauty and design was placed by the orders of An-nissir on  the very day that the mosque was completed, that is to say, on the twenty-third",291,book_3,chapter_3

On this day, which according to other writers was on the twenty-  second of the said month, and which happened to be a Friday, public prayers were  for the first time performed with great solemnity in this mosque. The Kddi who  officiated as Imém on this occasion was Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Abi ’Isa, An-ndssir  being present, as also the principal officers of the court. On the ensuing day the  Khalif attended a sermon which was preached by the same KAdi.   There were besides in Az-zahra two baths, one destined for the use of the officers  of the Sultén’s household and other servants attached to the palace, and the other  for the public ; and it was likewise provided with markets, inns, colleges, and other  public and private establishments.   We might go to a great length were we only to enumerate all the beauties,  natural as well as artificial, contained within the precincts of Az-zahra ;—the run-  ning streams, the limpid waters, the luxuriant gardens, the stately buildings for  the accommodation of the household guards, the magnificent palaces for the recep-  tion of all the high functionaries of the state ; the throng of soldiers, pages, eunuchs,  and slaves, of all nations and religions, sumptuously attired in robes of silk and  brocade, moving to and fro through its broad streets; or the crowds of judges,  Katibs, theologians, and poets, walking with becoming gravity through the  magnificent halls, spacious ante-rooms, and ample courts of the palace. The  number of male servants in the palace has been estimated at thirteen thousand  seven hundred and fifty, to whom the daily allowance of flesh meat, exclusive of  fowls and fish, was thirteen thousand pounds; the number of women of various  classes, comprising the harem of the Khalif, or waiting upon them, is said to have  amounted to six thousand three hundred and fourteen. The Sclavonian pages and  eunuchs were three thousand three hundred and fifty,—some say three thousand  three hundred and eighty-seven ;—to whom thirteen thousand pounds of flesh meat  were distributed daily, some receiving ten pounds each and some less, according to  their rank and station, exclusive of fowls, partridges, and birds of other sorts, game,  and fish; although there are not wanting authors who have computed the number  of Sclavonian servants employed in or about the palace at six thousand and eighty-  seven.?""_ The daily allowance of bread for the fish in the ponds of Az-zahr4 was  twelve thousand loaves, besides six kaftz of black pulse” which were every day  macerated in the waters. These and other particulars may be found at full length  in the histories of the time, and recorded by orators and poets who have exhausted  the mines of eloquence in their description: all agree that when this most beautiful  and magnificent palace was completed in the days of Al-hakem, all who saw it  owned that nothing similar to it could be found in the territories of Islam.",292,book_3,chapter_3

Indeed, had this palace pos-  sessed nothing more than the terrace of polished marble overhanging the match-  less gardens, with the golden hall and the circular pavilion, and the works of art of  every sort and description ;—had it had nothing else to boast of but the masterly  workmanship of the structure, the solidity of its foundations, the boldness of the  design, the beauty of the proportions, the elegance of the ornaments, hangings, and  decorations, whether of transparent marble or glittering gold, the columns that  seemed from their symmetry and smoothness as if they had been turned by turning-  machines, the paintings that equalled the choicest gardens, the artificial lake  so solidly constructed, the cistern perpetually filled with clear and limpid water,  and the amazing fountains, with figures of living beings ;—no imagination, however  rich and fertile, could have formed an idea of it. Praise be ascribed to the  Almighty God, who allowed those contemptible creatures to design and build such  enchanting palaces as these, and who permitted them to inhabit them as a sort of  recompense in this. world, and in order that the faithful might be stimulated to  follow the path of virtue by the reflection that, charming and delightful as the plea-  sures enjoyed by their owners were, they were still very far from giving even a  remote idea of those reserved for the true believer in the celestial paradise! We  ehall further see how this abode of contentment and mirth, how this splendid and  magnificent city, how these renowned bowers and gardens, were afterwards con-  verted by the Berbers into places of desolation and ruin. There is no God but  God! the great ! the Almighty !   This naturally brings to our recollection the great palace which Al-mansir Ibn  Dhi-n-niin, King of Toledo, built in that city, and in the construction of which he is  said to have lavished countless treasures. He not only employed all the best artists  of his age, but he sent also for architects, geometricians, and painters, from distant  lands ; made them execute the most fantastic and wonderful works, and rewarded  their labours with the greatest munificence. Adjoining to his palace he planted a  most luxuriant garden, in which he made an artificial lake, and in the centre of this  he built a kiosk of stained glass, adorned with gold.

Aw Andalusian historian has said that such were An-ndssir’s passion and taste for Aqueduct of  building that besides the erection of the magnificent palace that we have just de-  scribed, and the considerable additions made to the great mosque, he also undertook  and completed during his reign several public works for the improvement and orna-  ment of his capital. Of this number was a most magnificent aqueduct, which conveyed  excellent water from the mountains of Cordova to the palace of An-na’trah (the water-  wheel), in the western part of the city, by means of tubes geometrically arranged  over arches connected one with another. The waters thus conveyed, in admirable  order, and by dint of extraordinary science, were discharged into a vast reservoir,  on which was a colossal lion of wonderful workmanship, and so beautifully imitated  that the sight of it only was sufficient to cast fear into the hearts of the beholders,  and that none devised by the Sult4ns of former times had been seen equal to it,  either in likeness or in magnificence. It was covered with the purest gold, and  its two eyes were two jewels of inestimable value, which sent forth torrents of  light. The waters of the aqueduct entered into the hind part of this monster, and  then poured out from his mouth into the aforesaid basin, which circumstance,  united to the beautiful appearance of the animal, to its terrible and overawing  aspect, to the two eyes which shone forth as if they belonged to a human creature,  never failed altogether to produce the most extraordinary effect in the minds of  those who beheld it for the first time. After supplying this palace, and irrigating  with profusion every corner of its gardens, notwithstanding their great extent,  the superabundant water went to augment the Guadalquivir. Every author we  have consulted on the subject agrees in saying that this aqueduct, with the re-  servoir, and the figure pouring the water into it, must be considered as one of  the most amazing structures ever raised by man; for if we attend to the length of  VOL.

This took place on a Thursday, the third of Jumdadi-]l-akhar ;  on the same day the Khalif An-ndssir invited to his palace of An-na’tirah a large  party of the most illustrious citizens of Cordova, and gave them a most splendid  entertainment ; after which he distributed considerable largesses among his guests,  and lavished all sorts of rich presents on the architects and geometricians who had  directed the work, although they had already been most munificently remunerated  from the royal treasury.?   Az-zhirah. We have to mention another palace and city built by the famous Hajib, Mo-  hammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir, commonly called Al-mansir, although information  respecting it is by no means so abundant with us as we should wish. We  know that it existed at some distance from Cordova on the banks of the Guadal-  quivir, and that it was a most splendid structure, second to none but the palace  of Az-zahr4, built by ’Abdu-r-rahmdn ; but, owing to the circumstance of its being  destroyed by the Berbers, soon after the death of its founder,> during the disastrous  civil wars which brought to the ground the tottering throne of the Khalifs, the  memory of it was soon effaced, and such particulars as have been handed down to  us give but few details. Indeed, there are not wanting authors who suppose that it  also was built by ’Abdu-r-rahman An-néssir, confounding it no doubt with Az-  zahra, and being led into error by the similarity of the names ;‘ but, as Ibnu Khaldin  has clearly shown, they were two distinct and separate cities ; and the fact is further  proved by the testimony of contemporary writers, as Ibnu Hayy4n and others:  they all agree that when Al-mansiir usurped the Khalifate, during the minority of  Hishdm, son of Al-hakem, he built for his own security and residence a palace,  whither he transferred his treasures, stores, and arms. The edifice, which stood  on the banks of the Guadalquivir, not far from Az-zahra, was begun in the year  three hundred and sixty-eight of the Hijra (a. p. 978-9), the greatest part of it  being completed in the short space of two years. Al-manstir betook himself to it,  with his family, servants, guards, and adherents, in the year three hundred and  seventy (a.p. 980-1). He, moreover, established in it the offices of the state,  built magazines for grain, and erected mills ; he also granted the adjoining lands to",296,book_3,chapter_4
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 243    his Wizirs, Kétibs, Generals, and favourites, who lost no time in building mag-  nificent houses and palaces, and planting gardens in the neighbourhood ; people of  all ranks and professions, anxious to fix their abodes near the ruler of the state,  imitated their example, and built all round, so that in a very short time the  suburbs of Az-zahirah joined those of Cordova.   I recollect having read in an historical work, the composition of the author of  the Kitdbu-l-azhdr wa-l-anwdr,> which I saw in the library of Fez, the following  anecdote respecting Al-manstr, and the splendour and magnificence with which he  used to surround his person while residing in his palace of Az-zdhirah. There  came once to the court of Al-manstir ambassadors from the most powerful of the  Christian kings of Andalus ; their object was to ascertain the real strength of the  Moslems, and gain, if possible, a knowledge of their internal affairs. No sooner did  Al-mansir hear of their arrival than he issued orders for their suitable enter-  tainment, and began to make preparations previous to their admission to his pre-  sence. He ordered that a vast lake, several miles in length, which was in the  gardens of Az-zdhirah, should be planted entirely with water-lilies ;° he then caused  four kintars of gold, and four kintars of silver, to be cast into as many small pieces  as there were water-lilies in the lake, and ordered that one of those pieces should  be introduced into the cavity of each water-lily. All this having been executed  agreeably to his instructions, Al-mansiir dispatched a messenger to the Christian  ambassadors, and bade them appear in his presence the next morning at dawn. The  Christians did as they were desired, and found Al-mansir sitting in the great hall of  his palace, in a balcony overlooking the lake ; at sunrise one thousand Sclavonians  dressed in silken robes embroidered with silver and gold, their waists being girt by  sashes of gold tissue, and carrying in their hands gold and silver trays, made their  appearance, and the ambassadors were very much struck to see the beauty of their -  personal appearance, the magnificence of their dresses and ornaments, and the  admirable order in which they drew themselves up on each side of Al-mansir’s  throne,—the five hundred with robes of gold tissue and gold trays to the right, and the  five hundred with robes of silver tissue and silver trays to the left. The Christians,  in the meanwhile, not knowing what was meant, were dumb with amazement ; but  when the first sunbeams shone upon the water-lilies in the lake, all the Sclavonians  left their ranks at a signal from their chief, hastened to the spot, and began plucking  the flowers, placing those that had the silver pieces inside in the gold trays, and  those that had the gold pieces in the silver trays, and when every water-lily on the  lake had thus been plucked and placed in the silver and gold trays, they appeared  again in the presence of Al-mansir, and deposited their gatherings at his feet, thus  raising a mountain of silver and gold before his throne. When the Christian",297,book_3,chapter_4
"    244 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    ambassadors saw this, they were seized with astonishment, and remained deeply  convinced of Al-manstir’s immense resources and countless treasures; they  addressed him in the most humble terms, asked for a truce, which was granted,  and returned to their country, where they said to their king, ‘‘ Do not make war  “upon these people, for, by the Lord, we have seen the earth yielding them its  ‘* hidden treasures.”   It is related by Abi Idris Al-khauldni that as Al-manstr was one day sitting  in his palace of Az-zdhirah, reflecting on its beauties, listening to the murmur  of the running waters and to the songs of rare birds, inhaling the perfumes of  the scented flowers, and regaling his eyes with the emerald green of the bowers  and meadows,—as his whole soul in short was absorbed in the contemplation of  the manifold beauties surrounding him on every side,—suddenly tears rolled  down his cheeks, and he exclaimed, in deep sorrow, “‘O Az-zéhirah! may the  ‘* Almighty Lord save thee from the hands of the demon of war, who will ere  “‘long accomplish thy destruction!” and Al-manstr, after saying this, wept  bitterly and hid his face with both his hands. Then one of his favourites who  was present said to him, ‘‘ What ails thee, O Al-manstir? What words are these ?  ‘* What is the meaning of expressions which thy lips never uttered before ; and  “how comest thou to be assailed by thoughts so melancholy and sad as these,  “when the like of them never before entered thy mind?” ‘ God grant,” said  Al-manstr, ‘“‘ that my prediction be not fulfilled; for if my presentiments tell me  “ truth, the fire of civil discord will soon rage within the precincts of this palace,  ‘and all the beauties of Az-zéhirah will ere long be effaced,—all traces of it will  ‘« disappear from the face of the earth, this splendid mansion will be pulled down  “* and converted into a heap of ruins, the gardens transformed into a dreary desert,  ‘* my treasures will be squandered and scattered, and what was formerly the scene  “ of pleasure and mirth will be changed into a spot of desolation and ruin.”   Al-khauléni continues: ‘“ Alas! this prophecy of Al-manstir’s was speedily ful-  “ filled, as is well known; for his son Al-mudhfer, who after his death succeeded  “him in the command of the army and the management of public affairs, had  “‘ neither the abilities nor the popularity of his father, and the power of the  ‘ Khalifs began to decline. However, after the death of Al-mudhfer, whose  ‘administration did not last long, the reins of government were taken by his  “ brother ’Abdu-r-rahman, surnamed Sanjiil,”7 who was soon afterwards deposed and  “ put to death by a successful rebel, a prince of the royal blood, named Mohammed  “ Tbn Hishém Ibn ’Abdi-l-jabb4r, who afterwards assumed the honourable appella-  “tion of Al-muhdi-billah® (the directed by God). This Mohammed collected an  ‘ army in the provinces, marched against the capital, which he entered, and having",298,book_3,chapter_4
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 245    “ succeeded in securing the persons of ’Abdu-r-rahmén and of his principal par-  “ tisans, put them all to death. The rebels then repaired to Az-zéhirah, which  “ they levelled with the ground, as being the residence of the usurpers against whom  “ the war was raised. So this Al-muhdi, whom Al-mansir had not thought worthy  “his notice while he lived, not only cut off his lineage and snatched away the  “ empire from the hands of his posterity, but demolished the very edifices which he  “had erected. The power of the Beni ’A’mir. vanished for ever, and as a poet has  “ remarked,—  ‘ Hajin will no longer be As-safé’s faithful companion, the pilgrims will no  ‘ longer meet in Mekka to hold nightly confabulations.  ‘ Indeed, we ourselves shall perish, like the course of time and the passing  “ away of successive generations.’ ”®   Nor was the havoc and ruin confined to Az-zéhirah only. The same fate befel  Az-zahra and other palaces raised by the Beni Umeyyah, for during the civil com-  motions which disturbed the capital, and the struggles of the contending parties to  secure the empire, that splendid palace and city, where so many treasures had been  spent by ’Abdu-r-rahmén and by his son Al-hakem, was completely destroyed, and  vanished like evening ; the royal chambers were plundered of their costly furniture  and tapestry, every object of art was scattered, and the whole building transformed  into a heap of ruins; it is even asserted that many of the precious articles which  these palaces contained, such as arms, vases, jewels, and the like, were sold in  Baghdad and other cities of the East.’   Abi Nasr Al-fat’h says in his Matmah that the Wizir Hazm Ibn Jehwar”  happening once to pass with a friend of his by the palace of Az-zahrd, which in  his time had already been converted into a haunt of wild beasts, he pointed to it  and exclaimed,—   ““T once asked that house, whose inhabitants have now exterminated one  “ another,—where are thy owners, the eminent lords who ruled over us ?   “ And she answered me,—here they lived for a while, but they are now  “gone; they have vanished without my knowing where.” '?   They say also that a holy man who lived in those days, one of those austere and  pious Moslems whose thoughts are entirely consecrated to God, having once directed  his steps towards Az-z4hirah, when he came in sight of it was so much struck by  the magnificence and size of the building, the luxuriance and excellent arrangement  of the gardens, and the profusion of costly ornament and gilding lavished on it,  that he could not help exclaiming,— :   “* O palace of the kings! every house in this country has contributed to thy",299,book_3,chapter_4
"    246 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK 111.    “ ornament and perfection : thou shalt also (when in ruins) afford materials for  “* every house.” 8  Few days had elapsed since that pious and holy man had made his prayer when  all the treasures of Az-z4hirah were plundered and scattered over the country, and  the building itself was levelled with the ground, as we have previously stated,  in consequence of the horrid and disastrous civil war which soon arose in Andalus,  and from which no family or tribe escaped without contributing some victim.  Praise be ascribed to God, whose decrees are infallibly executed upon his creatures !  There is no God but Him! the high! the great !  pene ~The Christians, it appears, had likewise in Cordova a church to which pilgrims  came from distant lands. It was called Santa Maria, and was held by them in  great veneration and respect. They had besides, as Ibnu Hayyén relates, other  churches and chapels within and out of the city, and some monasteries in the  recesses of the neighbouring mountains, wherein their impious and abominable  rites were performed in the very faces of the Moslems. But their principal church  was the above-mentioned. The poet Ibn Shoheyd’® has preserved us the following  anecdote respecting this church. ‘I once entered at night,” says he, ‘“ into the  ‘« principal Christian church ; I found it all strewed with green branches of myrtle,  “ and planted with cypress trees.'° The noise of the thundering bells resounded in  “‘ my ears, the glare of the innumerable lamps dazzled my eyes ; the priests, decked  “in rich silken robes of gay and fanciful colours, girt by girdle cords,’” advanced  “to adore Jesus. Every one of those present had banished mirth from their  ** countenances, and expelled from their minds all agreeable ideas; and if they  “* directed their steps towards the marble font it was merely to take sips of water  “with the hollow of their hands. A priest then rose and stood among them, and  “‘ taking the wine-cup in his hands prepared to consecrate it; he applied to the  “liquor his parched lips, as dark as the dusky lips of a beautiful maid ;'* the  “ fragrancy of its contents captivated his senses, but when he had tasted the  “« delicious liquor, its sweetness and flavour seemed to overpower him.” On leaving  the church Ibn Shoheyd said extempore the following verses :  “ By the Lord of mercy! This mansion of God is pervaded with the smell  ‘ of the fermented red liquor, so pleasant to the youth.  “ It was to a girl’? that their prayers were addressed, it was for her that  “they put on their gay tunics instead of humiliating themselves before the  “« Almighty.  “ The priests, wishing us to stay long among them, began to sing round us  “ with their books ® in their hands ;",300,book_3,chapter_4

As this subject, however, has been one of great dispute among the learned, we deem  it convenient to state here a few of the arguments produced in favour of or against  the proposition.   The Imam Ibn ’Orfah, (the mercy of God be upon him!) treating about the  conditions required from an Im4m who is to pronounce judgment in conformity  with one of the approved sects, says, ‘‘ And if both the parties concerned should  “ resist the judge’s sentence there are three ways of remedying it, namely, to have  “ recourse to the decisions of Al-b4ji,”* or to the jurisdictional tribunals of Cordova,  “ or to the civil law of Sahniin,® the judge still deciding in conformity with the sect  “he may follow from among the sects professed by the people of Medina.”   Al-marazi disputes the opinion delivered by Ibn ’Orfah ; he agrees as to the first  appeal being right, but he denies the second, and declares that it is one of the errors  propagated by At-tortoshi™ in his work treating on the legal regulations of the  people of Cordova, and adds that it is a gross mistake, exhibiting great ignorance on  the part of the author ; the third however he admits.   Ibn Gh4zi entertains the same opinion as Al-mérazi, and says that the whole error  originated in a mistake made by At-tortoshi and copied by Ibn ’Orfah. Another  author, Ibn Shas,” has also discussed this subject at full length ; but let us hear what  our lord and ancestor Sidi Abi ’Abdillah Al-makkari At-telemsdni, who was Kadi-  I-koda4 (chief of the Kédis) at Fez, says in his work entitled ‘‘ foundations of civil law  among the people of Cordova,” after treating this subject at large. ‘‘ These were the  “* duties incumbent upon the office of K4di in Andalus, whence they were introduced  “and generally adopted in this country (Africa), for while we were disputing with  “ each other for the jurisdiction of Medina, and decided for that of Kiéfah, owing to  “ its having been the residence of a greater number of the companions of the Prophet  “* and heads of the law, such as ’Ali, Ibn Mes’iid, and others, the people of Cordova  “ refused to acknowledge it, and decided in all matters without the assistance of the  “lawyers in those cities; but God has spared my life and I have seen wonderful  “* changes of fortune.    ity Tahoma of",301,book_3,chapter_4

Nor did the evil, when once it raged,  ‘ stop at Cordova, for it spread widely among the people of other cities as soon as  “ the power of the Sultans of Cordova passed into the hands of the kings of small  ‘ states.27 The evil increased so much that they even neglected to appoint a head  ** of the law,?° but took as a foundation the old customs, and in this manner the  ‘* love of poetry, eloquence, intonation, genealogy, and other sciences cultivated by  ‘the ancients, lost every charm for their hearts, and instead they gave all their  ‘* attention to studies condemned by the heads of the law.”   The Hafedh Ibn Ghazi, after quoting the preceding passage from the work of our  illustrious ancestor, says as follows. ‘‘ I was told by a trustworthy person whom  “Tonce met, that when the very learned doctor, Abi Yahya Ash-sherif At-telem-  ‘* sini, came to the court of Fez, and began to give public lectures in the new city”  “upon the art of commenting upon and explaining the Koran, the reigning Sultan,  “whose name was Abt Sa’id Al-merini Al-hafid, convoked the principal theolo-  ‘‘ gians of the place to a meeting in his palace, to discuss various points of law  ‘* about which Al-makkari entertained a different opinion from the rest of the pro-  “ fession ; and that, although the doctors had almost agreed among themselves to  “ repudiate and condemn his doctrines, they could not help saying when they heard  ‘‘ him express his opinion that he had not gone further in his doubts than other  “* famous theologians, as Ibn Roshd and his disciples, Al-mateyti, and others among  ‘* the people of Cordova.”   This is what we have thought fit to say about Cordova in the present Book. We  shall, however, occasionally return to the subject when we treat about the Khalifs  of the house of Umeyyah, who resided in it, making it the capital of their empire,  ornamenting it with splendid buildings, magnificent palaces, and stupendous works  of public utility. In this, as well as in the other Books, our narrative has been  borrowed from the best Andalusian as well as Eastern authors, sometimes tran-  scribing literally from their works, but mostly abridging and extracting their",302,book_3,chapter_4

In so doing we have endeavoured to select the most interesting as well  as the most faithful records, by choosing among the descriptions of Cordova, which  are to be met with in almost every book upon the history or topography of Andalus,  those that appeared to us most interesting and true.   We shall now proceed to write the narrative of the occupation of that country by  the Moslems, from the year ninety-two of the Hijra (a.p. 711), when it was first  subdued by the Berbers, commanded by Miisa’s freedmen, until the moment when  it pleased the Almighty God to chastise the sins of the Moslems, and to permit  that the impious Christian should put his foot upon their necks.  strength, nor power, but in God! the high! the great!

No sooner was Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, then governor of Africa, apprised of the  success of this first expedition, which, as we have already observed, took place in  the month of Ramadhan of the year ninety-one (July, a. p. 710), than he appointed  his freedman, Tarik Ibn Zey4d, to command another expedition against Andalus,  and sent him over in company with Iy4n, King of Ceuta. The landing of Tarif  and Térik has been differently related ; but as it is our intention to recount in  detail every one of these events, and we shall therefore have many opportunities to  return to the subject, we shall now proceed to examine the causes which are  generally believed to have given rise to the conquest.   TIbnu Hayyaén says, ‘‘ One of the principal causes of the conquest of Andalus was cae Gite  “the appointment of Miisa Ibn Nosseyr to the government of Africa and more  “ remote lands: this took place in the year seventy-eight of the Hijra (beginning  “ March, a.p. 697),® by the Khalif ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Merwdn. Mhisa, whose  “ father, Nosseyr, had been a liberated slave of ’Abdu-l-’aziz, the Khalif’s brother,   “left the court of Damascus, followed only by a few volunteers, and arrived in  “Egypt; while there he collected together the Moslem troops which garrisoned  “ that province, and marched to take possession of his government.”   But this event is differently related by other historians. They say that Miisa was  not directly appointed by ’Abdu-l-malek, as before stated, but by ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn  Merwan,’ who then governed Egypt and Africa in the name of his brother ’Abdu-l-  malek Ibn Merwdn. Having received orders from the Khalif to send an army to  Africa, ’Abdu-1-’aziz, who knew Miisa’s talents and ability, gave him the command Apprintment  of it, and dispatched him to make war on the Berbers, and other nations which had  not yet been subdued. This, Al-homaydi states, took place in the year seventy-nine  (beginning March, a.p. 698), namely, one year after the date assigned by Ibnu Hayyan.   No sooner had Miisa arrived in Africa proper, than hearing that some of the Tks posses-  nations inhabiting the frontiers of Ss al-addnt (the nearest province of Stis) ® had government of  shaken off the yoke of Islim, he sent against them his own son ’Abdullah, who  soon returned with one hundred thousand captives. He sent Merwdén, another of  his sons, against the enemy in another quarter, and he also returned with one  hundred thousand captives. According to Al-leyth Ibn Sa’d the number of captives  taken in these two expeditions, commanded by the two sons of Miisa, must have  been still greater, since he asserts that the share of the Khalif amounted to sixty  thousand.’ But this is no doubt exaggerated, for we have read elsewhere that the  share belonging to the Khalif, being the fifth of the whole number, amounted only  to twenty thousand, although Misa is said to have sent him soon afterwards twenty",305,book_4,chapter_1

But be this as it may, certain it is that the  Khalif Al-walid received from his general a prodigious number of Berber captives  taken in war, and that the historian As-sadfi states that the captives (remaining)  in the hands of Mtisa amounted to a number never before heard of in any of the  countries subject to the rule of Islam.’®   Owing to this cause, adds the historian last mentioned, most of the African cities  were depopulated, the fields remained without cultivation, and, a general drought  ensuing, the Moslems were exposed to a most dreadful famine, as well as to most  raging thirst. In this extremity Miisa ordered a general fast throughout his do-  minions, and enjoined that public prayers should be said by all the Moslems. He  also recommended alms-giving, and the practice of good and charitable actions, to  appease the wrath of heaven. He then ordered a general procession, and placing  himself at the head of his people, followed by their cattle and beasts of burden, he  entered far into the desert."" There he separated the mothers from the young ones,  and the cries and lamentations began, and he remained in the desert until noon-  time, when he ordered a general prayer ; and this being done, he preached the usual  sermon (khotbah) ;'? and some of the auditory having remarked that he had made  no mention whatever of the Khalif Al-walid, one man got up and said, ‘“ Why  ** didst thou not, O Misa! mention the Khalif in thy sermon?” To which Misa  replied, ‘‘ Because this is neither the moment nor the place to invoke any one but  “ Allah (may his name be exalted !)” No sooner did Misa speak these last words  than the rain began to fall in torrents, numerous streams oozed up through the  sands of the desert, and the men drank until their thirst was quenched.   After this, Mtisa went out against the Berbers, and pursued them far into their  native deserts, leaving wherever he went traces of his passage, killing numbers of  them, taking thousands of prisoners, and carrying on the work of havoc and de-  struction. He next penetrated into Sis al-addnt, where he met with no resistance  on the part of the inhabitants, who humbly besought him to grant them peace, and  embraced Isl4m. Those, however, who still persisted in their hostility against the  Moslems, Misa attacked in person, or by the various divisions of his army, defeated  them in the field, and stormed their towns ; and never ceased pushing his conquests  until he arrived before Tangiers,* the citadel of their country and the mother of  their cities, which he also besieged and took, obliging its inhabitants to embrace  Islam. ;   They say that Tangiers had never been taken by an enemy before the days of  Misa; and, once in the hands of the Moslems, it became one of their strongest  citadels.'*   The same historian from whom we have borrowed the preceding particulars adds",306,book_4,chapter_1

When the nations inhabiting the dreary plains of Africa saw what had befallen Genera! svt. |  the Berbers of the coast and of the interior, they hastened to ask for peace and Bere.  place themselves under the obedience of Miisa, whom they solicited to enlist them  in the ranks of his army. Musa lent a favourable ear to their petitions, and gave  them generals to command them. He also appointed his‘ freedman Tarik Ibn  Zeyad, the Berber, (whom some authors make of the tribe of Sadf,) to be governor  of Tangiers and the neighbouring districts, and placed under his orders nineteen  thousand Berbers, well provided with arms, and every requisite store to carry on  the war. In order to instruct these Berbers in the duties of true religion, for they  had all been previously converted to Islam, and their conversion had been sincere,   Misa further left with them a few learned Arabs and theologians, to read and  explain to them the sacred words of the Koran, and instruct them in all and every  one of the duties enjoined by their new religion.'®   This arrangement being made, Muisa returned to Africa proper, and when on jy oamediates  looking round him he saw no more enemies to attack, no more nations to subdue, ""42!""  either among the Berbers or among the Greeks,!’—when he perceived that the  principal cities along the coast had all been taken,—he wrote to his freedman Térik,  who was governor of Tangiers, and ordered him to get himself and troops ready to  make an incursion into the opposite land of Andalus. In compliance with this  order from his master, T4rik put to sail from the port of Tangiers with twelve  thousand of the new converts, and landed at the foot of the mountain which  afterwards took his name on Monday, the fifth day of Rejeb, of the year ninety-two  of the Hijra (a.p. April 28th, 711).

They say that, having given to this general the  command of an army, he directed him against the nations inhabiting the northern  coast of Africa. Térik marched first against Tangiers, which he took; he then  directed his arms against certain districts which acknowledged the sway of the  Kings of Andalus, and the capital of which was Ceuta, a strongly fortified city.""° A  barbarian chief, named Ilyan, ruled as sovereign in it: he was a man of great  resolution and courage; having been on a former occasion attacked by Misa, he  not only bravely withstood the attack, but made a sally at the head of his best  troops and obliged that general to raise the siege.

King Wittiza the country and destroying the fields, thinking that he would thus reduce them by   oo to famine ; but this also proved unavailing, for Ghittishah (Wittiza),” who then   the besieged. reigned in Andalus, sent them reinforcements and provided them by means of his  fleet with all sorts of provisions and military stores. As long as Wittiza occupied  the throne of Andalus the garrison of Ceuta defended itself with the greatest  courage and perseverance, and fought valiantly for the preservation of their families  and liberty; but on the death of that monarch the state of affairs was entirely  changed, and, owing to the civil dissensions which soon arose among the Goths,  the Moslems were enabled not only to reduce such cities as still acknowledged their  sway in Africa, but to push their conquests into the very heart of Andalus.   Death of Wit- —-Wittiza left sons” behind him, but the Goths not being satisfied with them this  gave rise to much tumult and agitation, until they decided upon giving the crown  to a chief named Roderic, who, although he was not of the royal blood, belonged to  one of the principal families of the land, and was moreover known to be a brave   : and gallant soldier, and one much experienced in the affairs of the kingdom.   Usurpation of — Tbnu Hayydn, in his Muktabis,* gives some account of this Roderic. He agrees  that he was not a descendant from the kings who occupied the throne of Andalus  before him, but that he was a powerful and noble lord, much respected for his  talents and his courage, and that having formed a considerable party among the  people he succeeded in snatching the sceptre from the sons of King Wittiza.   Another writer says that when Wittiza died he left three sons, who being of  tender years were not deemed fit to govern the country, upon which their mother *  assumed the royal power, and, holding the reins of government, administered the  kingdom in their name,—Toledo continuing to be her residence as well as the  court of the empire. However, Roderic, who under the reign of her husband Wittiza  had commanded the cavalry, refused to acknowledge the authority of the widow-  queen, and, having created a rebellion in Cordova, seized on the empire.   Iyiny Lord of But let us hear the account of Abii Zeyd Ibn Khaldiin, who, after saying that  Andalus was in the hands of the Goths, and that their king at the time was called  Roderic, expresses himself in the following terms :—‘ Besides their kingdom of  ‘* Andalus the Goths had settlements beyond the sea, so that when Misa arrived  ‘in Africa they were in possession of large tracts of land along its northern shore.*  “« These they were at first enabled to defend on account of their holding Tangiers,  “‘ which was the key of the straits, and owing also to the narrowness of the sea  ‘“‘ which separates Andalus from Africa, and which enabled them to send reinforce-  “‘ ments wherever they were required, so as to keep those countries in obedience  “and defend them against the Arabs. A great many of the tribes inhabiting the  “ coast were therefore subject to them. Now in that part of the country which is",308,book_4,chapter_1
"    cuaP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 255    “now called Jebdl Ghomdrah (the mountains of Gomera) * there was a king of  “ the Berbers 7” named Ily4n, who acknowledged himself a subject of the Gothic  “ monarchs, obeyed their sway, and followed their religion.» Africa was governed  “at the time by Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, a lieutenant of the Khalif Al-walid Ibn ’Abdi-l-  “ malek, who resided at Cairw4n, then the seat of the African governors. Under  “ that general the Moslem armies subdued the greatest part of Africa and carried  “the war to the extreme western frontiers, after which they penetrated into the  “ mountain districts about Tangiers, and opened themselves a passage until they  “reached the mouth of the straits, when King Ily4n, unable to withstand their  “ attacks, surrendered, and submitted himself to the sway of Islam. Mbisa Ibn  “Nosseyr then appointed his freedman Térik Ibn Zeydd Al-leythi to the govern-  “ment of his new conquests, as well as to the command of all the troops encamped  “in those districts.” So far Ibnu Khaldiin, whose account does not ant %  differ from that of the preceding writers.  We have said that one of the principal causes of the conquest of Andalus was the nya Tyén's discon-  appointment of Misa Ibn Nosseyr to the government of Africa; the second in order  is the enmity that broke out between Ilyén and Roderic. Every historian that we  have consulted alludes more or less explicitly to a certain quarrel between those two  individuals, which led to the invasion of the Arabs.” The author before quoted,  Abé Zeyd Ibn Khaldin, attributes it to a desire on the part of Ilydn of revenging  certain injuries he had received in the person of his daughter, who was then staying  in the royal palace ; since, adds that historian, it was a custom among the Gothic  nobles to send their daughters to be brought up and educated at the royal palace,  along with the king’s daughters. They say that when Ilyén heard of the outrage  committed on the person of his daughter he repaired immediately to court, took  her away, and brought her back to Africa. Not satisfied with this, he went to  see Tarik, acquainted him with his desire of revenge, engaged him to invade  Andalus, and offered to conduct his army through the enemy’s country. TArik,  who wished nothing so much as an occasion of trying the fortune of arms against  the neighbouring kingdom, immediately seized on Ilyan’s offer, and, having pre-  viously obtained his master’s leave, prepared for the intended expedition. But as  the doings between Ily4n and Roderic, and the application made by the former to  the Arabian general, are recounted more at length by other writers, we shall borrow  from them what we deem necessary to make this our history both agreeable and  instructive.  “It was then the custom among the Goths,” says Al-khozeyni, ‘“ for the nysu’s daugh-  “ princes of the royal blood, the great noblemen of the kingdom, and the governors Ree  “ of the provinces, to send to the supreme court at Toledo such among their sons *°*""*    a",309,book_4,chapter_1

In  ‘* the same manner the daughters were sent to the king’s palace, and educated with  ‘“‘ his daughters, and when grown up the king would marry them to the young  “‘ noblemen at his court, according to their fathers’ dignity, and bestow upon them  “* marriage portions. ,   “It happened that in compliance with this custom Ilyan, the Lord of Ceuta,  “a city then under the sway of King Roderic, and the inhabitants of which also  ‘« professed the Christian religion, having a daughter, a beautiful and innocent  ‘* creature, crossed the straits and took her to Toledo, then the court and capital  “‘ of the kingdom. When Roderic beheld her, he was so much struck with her  “beauty that he fell desperately in love, and did not hesitate, when persuasion  “‘ had failed, to obtain by violence the gratification of his wishes. Some time  “ afterwards the girl found the means of secretly acquainting her father with the  “ treatment she had suffered at the hands of Roderic ; and it is related that when  “‘ Tlydn read his daughter’s message he fell into a most violent rage, and swore  “‘to revenge the injury inflicted by Roderic, exclaiming,—‘ By the faith of the  “* Messiah ! I will undermine his throne and disturb his dominions, until the whole  “is overturned and annihilated.’ So there can be no doubt that the injury done to  “« Tly4n’s daughter was one of the causes of the conquest of Andalus, subordinate  “to what God Almighty had decreed about it. Ily4n embarked immediately for  “ Andalus, although the inclement season was far advanced,—it being then the month  “ of January®? and the depth of winter,—and hastening to Toledo presented himself  “before the king, who, not expecting him at so unseasonable a time, upbraided  ‘him for leaving his post, and addressed him in the following words: ‘ What  “ brought thee here? Thou knowest very well that this is neither the time nor the  “ occasion for thy coming to court.’ To which Ilyén answered, excusing himself by  “ saying that his wife was dangerously ill, and desired greatly to see her daughter  ‘* once more before she died, and had begged and entreated him to fetch her. He  ‘then asked Roderic to issue orders that his daughter should be delivered to  “him, and all her baggage prepared for: immediate departure. Roderic granted  “his request, not without having previously made the daughter promise that she  “would keep their intercourse a secret from her father, but the girl preferred her  “ father to the king, and informed the former of his conduct towards her. They  “ say, on the authority of Ilyan himself, that when about to take leave of the king  “the latter addressed him as follows: ‘O Ily4n! I hope that I shall soon hear of  “thee, and that thou wilt endeavour to procure for me some of those very swift",310,book_4,chapter_1

I will never feel satisfied until I bring thee such sha-  “« dhankah as thou never sawest in thy life ;’ meaning by this the Arabs, whom he  ‘* already thought of bringing against his country. But Roderic did not understand  “ the meaning of his words.”   No sooner did Ilyén find himself safe in Africa than he repaired to the city of  Cairwan, where the Arabian governor then held his court, and by his glowing  descriptions of the fertility, wealth, and extent of the island of Andalus, by repre-  senting his countrymen as divided and weakened by internal divisions, and enervated  by their luxurious habits and a long peace, prevailed upon Miisa, as we shall  presently relate, to send with him some troops under the command of one of his  Berber freedmen, who, with the rapidity of the hawk pouncing upon his prey,  subdued the whole kingdom, and added new and extensive dominions to those  already subject to the sway of Islam.   Some historians assign a third cause for the conquest of Andalus ; they say that  there was at Toledo a palace built in times of old by a sage king, who, having  predicted that Andalus would in times to come be invaded by people from Africa,  had placed in one of its rooms a certain magic spell, by means of which the  country was to be for ever preserved from foreign invasion. As long as the  spell remained untouched Andalus was safe, but when broken (and it was so  by Roderic) the ruin of that country became inevitable. This event is thus related  by various historians.   It is well known that the Greeks ™ were a nation famous for their knowledge in eae eo  the sciences, as well as for their talent and acuteness in availing themselves of the ara  secrets of nature. Before the times of Alexander they inhabited the East, but their country.  when the Persians predominated in those quarters, and subdued every one of the  realms possessed by the Greeks, they decided upon emigrating and taking to a  distant land their knowledge and their science. They fixed upon the island of  Andalus, owing to its being placed at the extremity of the inhabited world, on  which account it was scarcely known at the time, had never been possessed by  any of the sage monarchs of olden times, and, finally, was then without inhabitants ;  for although Andalus, son of Yafeth, son of Nuh, had settled in it soon after the  deluge, taken it for his residence, given it his name, and left besides various traces  of his domination, yet his generation had since perished, and the country was then  a desert.* ‘   It has been said that when the earth was first peopled after the deluge it appeared   VOL. 1. 2.",311,book_4,chapter_1

In order, therefore, not to be hindered and disturbed in the study  and cultivation of science, which made the principal business of their lives, they  fled before the Persians, their enemies, and migrated to Andalus, where they had  no sooner arrived than they began to dig canals, and to make cuts from the rivers  for the purpose of irrigation ; to erect bridges and aqueducts, to construct fortresses  and castles, to plant gardens and vines, and to build cities and towns; ploughing  and sowing the land, and raising whatever buildings were deemed necessary for  the pleasure and comfort of the people. In fine, the country soon became so thickly  peopled, and so studded with cities and towns, that one of their wise men, who  knew well that the country they inhabited had been called “‘ the bird’s tail,” owing  to the supposed resemblance of the earth to a bird with extended wings, is said  to have remarked that that bird was the peacock, the principal beauty of which  is well known to be in the tail. This brings to our recollection a witty answer once  made by a Western Arab to the Prince of believers, Hartin Ar-rashid (the mercy of  God be upon him!) That Khalif happened on a certain day to address a native  of Africa in the following manner: ‘ I am told, O man! that the world resembles  “a bird in shape ; and that the west is the tail.” ‘‘ Thou hast been told right, O  “ Prince of the believers!” replied the Maghrebi, “ but thy informer ought to have  “added that that bird was the peacock ;” hearing which, Ar-rashid laughed and  wondered much at the man’s quickness at repartee in defending his native country.  But to proceed with our account of the spell.”   The Greeks continued in possession of Andalus, leading a life of security and  pleasure. They took for a capital the city of Toledo, owing to its being situate  in the heart of Andalus, and their principal care consisted in strengthening it  against their enemies and maintaining themselves in their possessions, and con-  cealing from other nations the knowledge of the comforts they were enjoying. In  order better to gain their object they began consulting the stars, and found that  by two nations only were they to be disturbed in their enjoyments, and to be hated",312,book_4,chapter_1

When the Greeks heard of this prognostic they were struck with fear,  and trembled for their populated island ; they agreed upon constructing immediately  a talisman that should avert their impending ruin, and by its power keep off the  two nations mentioned in the prophecy, to which effect they began consulting  the stars for a time and place fit for their undertaking. In the meanwhile, when-  ever some of the scattered tribes of Berbers inhabiting along the northern coast of  Africa happened to approach the sea shore, being thus separated only from Andalus  by a narrow channel, the fears and consternation of the Greeks would increase,  they would fly in all directions for fear of the threatened invasion, and their dread  of the Berbers waxed so great that it was instilled into their nature, and became in  after times a prominent feature in their character. On the other side, the Berbers  having been made acquainted with this ill-will and hatred of the people of An-  dalus towards them, hated and envied them the more, this being in a certain  measure the reason why even a long time afterwards a Berber could scarcely be  found who did not most cordially hate an Andalusian, and vice versa, only that  Berbers being more in want of Andalusians than these are of them, owing to  certain necessaries not to be procured in Africa, and which are imported from  Andalus, a communication has necessarily existed between the people of both  countries. But to return. .   There was in the west of Andalus a Grecian king, who reigned over an island  called the island of Kadis (Cadiz). This king had a daughter of incomparable  beauty, whom the other kings of Andalus,—for that country was then ruled by several  kings, each having estates not extending over more than one or two cities,—sought  in marriage. Each of these kings sent accordingly his messengers to Cadiz, and asked  for the hand of the beautiful daughter. Her father, however, unwilling to choose  among so many pretenders, lest by favouring one he should offend the others, was  very much perplexed, and sent for his daughter to acquaint her with the state of his  mind. Now it happened that the daughter of this king was possessed of much  wisdom as well as beauty, for among the Greeks both men and women were born  with a natural instinct for science; this having led to that common saying, that  ‘* science came down from heaven and lodged itself in three different parts of man’s  “ body; in the brains amongst the Greeks, in the hands amongst the Chinese,  “and in the tongue among the Arabs.” This daughter, then, having heard the  whole of the case, said to her father, ‘‘ Only do what I will tell thee, and do not  “ trouble thyself any more about this matter.”—‘ What is thy advice then? ’—  “‘ That to those who solicit my hand thou shouldst answer, that I will give the",313,book_4,chapter_1
"    260 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK Iv.    ‘* preference to him only who proves himself a sage king;” and her father ac-  cordingly dispatched messengers to the neighbouring kingdoms to acquaint the  royal suitors with his daughter’s determination. When the lovers read the letters  containing the princess’s intentions, many who could not lay any claim to science  immediately desistéd from their courtship ; two kings only being found among her  numerous admirers who professed themselves sages, and who immediately answered  his letters, each saying of himself, ‘‘ I am a sage king.” ‘When the father got  these letters, he sent for his daughter, and, informing her of their contents, ‘‘ See,”  said he, ‘“ we are still in the same difficulty as before; for here are two kings who  ‘* both call themselves sages, and if I choose one I shall make an enemy of the  “other. What dost thou propose to do in such a difficulty?” The daughter  replied, ‘‘ I will impose a task upon both kings, and whichsoever of the two executes  ‘it best, he shall be my husband.”—“ And pray, what is it? ’—‘‘ We want in  “ this town a wheel to draw up water ; I will ask one of them to make me one that  ‘‘ shall be moved by fresh running water coming from yonder land; and I will  ‘‘intrust the other with the construction of a talisman or charm to preserve this  ‘island from the invasions of the Berbers.”   The king was delighted with the plan suggested by his daughter, and, without  bestowing any more consideration on the subject, wrote to both the princes, making  them acquainted with his daughter’s ultimate determination; and each having  agreed to undergo the intended trial, they set to work as soon as possible. The  king to whose lot it had fallen to construct the hydraulic machine * erected an  immense building, with large stones placed one upon the top of another, in that part  of the salt sea which separates the island of Andalus from the continent; and in the  spot known by the name of Strait of Ceuta.*® This arched building, which was  built entirely of free-stone, the interstices of which were filled by the architect with  some cement of his own composition, connected the island of Cadiz with the main  land. Traces of this work are still visible in that part of the sea which divides  Ceuta from Algesiras,“° but the greatest part of the inhabitants of Andalus assign it  another origin, as I have already explained elsewhere ; they suppose it to be the  remains of a bridge which Alexander ordered to be constructed between Ceuta. and  Algesiras : but God only knows which of the two reports is the true one, although  I find the last of the two more generally believed. However, when the architect _  had finished his work of stone, he conducted fresh water from the top of a high  mountain on the continent to the island, and making it afterwards all fall into a  basin, he caused it to rise again in Andalus by means of a wheel.*!   As to the other king, whose task was the construction of the magic spell, he first  consulted the skies in quest of a proper and fit time to commence its fabrication ;",314,book_4,chapter_1
"    CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. . 261    and when he had discovered it, he began to build a square edifice. The materials  were of white stone, and the place chosen for its erection a sandy desert on the sea  shore. In order to give sufficient solidity to the building, the architect sunk the  foundations as deep into the earth as the building itself rose above the surface ;  and when he had completed it, he placed on the top a statue of melted copper and  iron, mixed together by dint of his science, to which he further gave the look and  appearance of a Berber, with a long beard ; his hair, which was exceedingly coarse,  stood upright on his head, and he had besides a tuft hanging over his forehead.“? His  garment consisted of a tunic, the ends of which he held on the left arm; he wore san-  ‘ dals on his feet, and the most extraordinary thing about him was that, although the  dimensions of the figure were excessive, and he stood up in the air at a distance  of more than sixty or seventy cubits, no other support was seen but the natural one  at his feet, which were at most one cubit in circumference. He had his right  arm extended, and in his hand were visible some keys with a padlock ;* with his  right hand he pointed towards the sea, as if he were saying, “ No one is to pass  “ this way ;” and such was the magic virtue contained in this figure, that as long  as it kept its place, and held the keys in its hand, no ship from Barbary could ever  sail into the strait, on account of its stormy and fearful waters.“   However, each of the kings worked with uncommon activity at his task,  hoping that whichsoever of the two accomplished his first stood a good chance of  gaining the heart of the princess. The constructor of the aqueduct was the  first to finish his, for he contrived so as to keep it secret from the other, in hopes  that if he did his work first, the talisman would not be completed, and the  victory would remain to him: and so it happened, for he measured his time so well,  that on the very same day on which his rival’s work was to be accomplished water  began to run in the island, and the wheel to move; and when the news of his   - success reached his competitor, who was then on the top of the monument giving  the last polish to the face of the figure, which was gilt, he took it so much to heart  that he threw himself down, and fell dead at the foot of the tower; by which means  the other prince, freed from his rival, became the master of the lady, of the wheel,  and of the charm.   The author from whom the preceding narrative is borrowed does not acquaint  us in what manner the spell acted against Africans, nor how its virtue came to be  impaired, but we here subjoin another writer’s version of this story.   In times of old the Greek kings who reigned in Andalus were terribly afraid of  an invasion on the part of the Berbers, on account of the prophecy that we have  recorded. To avoid this they constructed different spells, and, among others, one  which they put inside a marble urn and placed in a palace at Toledo: in order",315,book_4,chapter_1
"    262 . HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Boox Iv.    to ensure its custody and preservation they placed a padlock on the gate of the  palace, leaving instructions for every succeeding king to do the same. This injunc-  tion having been faithfully complied with, it came to pass that after the lapse ofa  great many years twenty-seven padlocks were appended to the gate of the building,  that number of kings having reigned in Andalus, each of whom had put his  padlock as ordained. Some time previous to the invasion of the Arabs, which, as is  well known, was the cause of the overthrow of the Gothic dynasty and of the entire  conquest of Andalus, a king of the Goths, Roderic by name,** ascended the throne.  Now this king, being young and fond of adventure, once assembled his Wizirs,  great officers of the state, and members of his council, and spoke to them thus :—  “T have been thinking a long time about this house with its seven-and-twenty  “ padlocks, and I am determined to have it opened, that I may see what it contains,  ‘« for I am sure it is a mere jest.” ‘‘ It may be so, O King!” answered one of the  Wizirs ; ‘‘ but honesty, prudence, and policy demand that thou shouldst not do it;  “ and that, following the example of thy father, of thy grandfather, and of thy  “ ancestors,—none of whom ever wished to dive into this mystery,—thou shouldst  “add a new padlock to the gate.” When the Wizir had done speaking, Roderic  replied,—‘* No: I am led by an irresistible impulse, and nothing shall make me  “ change my resolution. I have an ardent wish to penetrate this mystery, and my  “ curiosity must be satisfied.” ‘‘ O King! answered the Wizirs, “if thou doest it  “under a belief that treasures are concealed in it, let us hear thy estimation of  ‘them, and we will collect the sum among ourselves and deposit it in thy royal  “ treasure, rather than see ourselves and thee exposed to frightful calamities and  “‘ misery.” But Roderic being a man of undaunted spirit, stout of heart, and  strong of determination, was not easily persuaded. He remained deaf to the  entreaties of his counsellors and proceeded immediately towards the palace, and  when he arrived at the gate, which, as we have already observed, was furnished  with several locks, each of them having its key hanging to it, the gate was  thrown open, and nothing else was to be seen but a large table made of gold  and silver and set with precious stones, upon which was to be read the following  inscription :—‘‘ This is the table of Suleyman, son of Datid, (upon whom be  “* peace!)” Another object, besides the table, was to be seen in another apartment  of the palace, provided. also with a very strong padlock, which being removed  * allowed Roderic to look into it. But what was his astonishment on entering the  apartment when nothing was to be seen but the urn, and inside it a roll of  parchment and a picture representing in the brightest colours several horsemen  looking like Arabs, dressed in skins of animals, and having, instead of turbans,  locks of coarse hair; they were mounted 'on fleet Arabian steeds, bright scimitars",316,book_4,chapter_1
"    cua. 1.) DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 263    hung by their sides, and their right hands were armed with spears. Roderic ordered  his attendants to unroll the parchment, when lo! what did he see but the following  inscription written in large letters upon it :—‘‘ Whenever this asylum is violated, and  “ the spell contained in this urn broken, the people painted on this urn shall invade  “ Andalus, overturn the throne of its kings, and subdue the whole country.”*  They say that when Roderic read this fatal prognostic he repented of what he had  done, and was impressed with a strong belief of his impending ruin. He was not  mistaken, for tidings soon reached him of an army of Arabs, which the emperor of  the East sent against him.   This is the enchanted palace and the picture to which Roderic is said to have  alluded afterwards, on the day of the battle of Guadalete, when, as he was advancing  upon the Moslems, he saw for the first time. before his eyes the very men whose  representations were upon the parchment. Of this more will be said hereafter.  But whether this account is a true one or not, God only knows, for we find it  related in various ways by the historians, as we shall have further occasion to  observe when we come to, treat about the famous table of Suleyman and other  particulars connected with this case, and that we shall do by taking our information  from the best and purest sources. As to the other story, namely, that of the sage  king making a contrivance to bring sweet water from Africa into Andalus, it is  scarcely credible, for Andalus happens just to be one of the countries most  abounding in waters and rivers ; and therefore we do not see the necessity of  bringing water from the opposite shore, unless, as some pretend, the princess only  did it to puzzle her admirer and try his skill by imposing upon him this extra-  ordinary and most difficult task.

No sooner did Ily4n, the Lord of Ceuta, arrive safely in his dominions, than he  went to see the Amir Misa Ibn Nosseyr, and proposed to him the conquest of  Andalus, which he described as a country of great excellence and blessings ; he  told him that it was a land abounding in productions of all kinds, rich in grain  of all sorts, plentiful in waters renowned for their sweetness and clearness; he  proceeded afterwards to draw the picture of the inhabitants, whom he affirmed  to be enervated by long peace, and destitute of arms.! This account awakened  the ambition of the Amir, who, after a mature deliberation on the proposition  made to him, came to the following agreement with Ily4n,—that he should desert  the cause which he was then defending? and pass over to the Moslems, and that  by way of proving his enmity towards his own countrymen, professing the same  religion as himself, he should first of all make an incursion into their country. This  Tly4n immediately put into execution, and, collecting some troops in the districts  subject to his rule, he embarked in two vessels and landed on the coast of  Algesiras,> whence he overran the country, and after killing and making a number  of captives he and his companions returned safe to Africa, loaded with spoil, on the  following day.   No sooner did the news of this first expedition, which took place at the close  of the year ninety,* become known in Africa, than a great many Moslems flocked  under the banners of Ily4n and trusted him. As for the Amir Misa, he wrote    Misa aequaints immediately to the Khalif Al-walid, informing him of what Iy4n proposed to    Al-walfd with  the victory.    him to undertake against Andalus, and asking his leave to try the conquest,*  and the answer of the Khalif was conceived in the following terms :—‘“ Let",318,book_4,chapter_2
"    CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 265    “the country be first explored by light troops, to overrun it and bring thee  “news of what it contains; be prudent, and do not allow the Moslems to be  ‘lost in an ocean of dangers and horrors.” To which Misa replied, “ It is  “ not an ocean, but only a narrow channel, whose shores are every where distinct  “to the eye.” ‘‘ Never mind,” answered Al-walid; ‘‘ even if it be so, let the  “« country be first explored.” ®   Accordingly Misa sent a freedman of his, a Berber, whose name was Tarif Abi ape  Zar’ah,’ with four hundred foot and one hundred horsemen,® with instructions to  make an incursion into Andalus. Tarif and his small army embarked in four vessels,  and landed on an island situated opposite to another island? close to Andalus, and  known by the name of Jeztrah Al-khadhrd (the green island), where the Arabs  of the present days keep their ships and their naval stores,'° it being their principal  port to cross over to Africa. In this island, which has since taken the name of Tarif,  on account of his landing on it,'' the Berber general stayed a whole day, until all  his men were with him ;!? he then moved on and made several inroads into the  main land, which produced a rich spoil and several captives, who were so hand-  some that Misa and his companions had never seen the like of them.’* This  took place in the month of Ramadhan of the year ninety-one (Aug.-Sept. a.p.  710),'* and when it was made known every one wished to go to Andalus.   The number of troops that accompanied Tarif in this expedition is not satis- Lanting of  factorily ascertained. Some authors make it amount to one thousand men ; others  give him only half that number, as above stated. But we must observe that the  whole of these accounts are very doubtful, since there are not wanting historians  who make Tarif a different person from Abi Zar’ah, as these words of one of them  seem to purport. ‘‘ Tarif returned from this expedition loaded with spoil, and  “ bringing a great number of captives ; another incursion was made by a Sheikh  “of the Berbers, whose name was Abi Zar’ah,'® who landed with one thousand  “men of his nation on the island of Algesiras, and finding that the inhabitants  “had deserted the island he set fire to their houses and fields, and burnt also  “a church '® very much venerated amongst them. He then put to the sword such  “of its inhabitants as he met, and, making a few prisoners, returned safe to  “* Africa.”   But we believe the former account to be the most credible, since it is confirmed  by Ar-rdzi!7 and other historians, who make these two captains to be one and the  same person, and call him Abi Zar’ah Tarif Ibn Malik Al-mughéferi,'® for such  were his name and patronymic.

He  at the same time instigated him to undertake the conquest of the country more at  large: he told him what captives they had brought him, and the good tidings about  the fertility and wealth of the land. When Misa heard of it he praised God for the  victory he had granted his servants, and strengthened himself in his intention of  invading Andalus ; to this effect he called a freed slave of his, to whom he had on  different occasions intrusted important commands in his armies, and whose name  was Tarik Ibn Zeydd Ibn ’Abdillah, a native of Hamdan, in Persia, although some  pretend that he was not a freedman of Misa Ibn Nosseyr, but a free-born man of the  tribe of Sadf,?° while others make him a mauli?! of Lahm. It is even asserted that  some of his posterity who lived in Andalus rejected with indignation the supposition  of their ancestor having ever been a liberated slave of Misa Ibn Nosseyr. Some  authors, and they are the greatest number, say that he was a Berber, but, as we  intend to form a separate article about Tarik, we shall leave the discussion of this  and other points for another place, confining ourselves at present to the relation  of the historical events as we find them recorded by the best Andalusian writers.   To this Tarik, therefore, whether a liberated slave of Misa, or a freeman of the  tribe of Sadf, the Arabian governor of Africa committed the important trust of con-  quering the kingdom of Andalus, for which end he gave him the command of an  army of seven thousand men, chiefly Berbers and slaves, very few only being genuine  Arabs. To accompany and guide Térik in this expedition Miisa again sent Iyan,  who provided four vessels from the ports under his command, the only places on  the coast where vessels were at that time built. Every thing being got ready, a  division of the army crossed that arm of the sea which divides Andalus from Africa,  and landed with T4rik at the foot of the mountain which afterwards received his  name, on a Saturday, in the month of Sha’bdn of the year ninety-two (July, 711),  answering to the month of Agosht (August), and the four vessels were sent back,  and crossed and recrossed until the rest of Térik’s men were safely put on shore.   It is otherwise said that T4rik landed on the twenty-fourth of Rejeb (19th June,  711), in the same year. Another account makes the number of men embarked on  this occasion amount to twelve thaqusand, all but sixteen, a number consisting almost  entirely of Berbers, there being but few Arabs amongst them ; but the same writer  agrees that Ilydn transported this force at various times™ to the coast of Andalus  in merchant vessels, (whence collected it is not known,) and that Térik was the  last man on board.*   Various historians have recorded two circumstances concerning Tarik’s passage  and his landing on the coast of Andalus, which we consider worthy of being tran-  scribed. They say that while he was sailing across that arm of the sea which",320,book_4,chapter_2
"    CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 267    separates Africa from Andalus he saw in a dream™ the prophet Mohammed,  surrounded by Arabs of the Muhajirin®® and Anssdr, who with unsheathed swords  and bended bows stood close by him, and that he heard the Prophet say, “ Take  “ courage, O Térik! and accomplish what thou art destined to perform;” and that  having looked round him he saw the messenger of God, (upon whom be the peace  and salutation of his Lord!) who with his companions was entering Andalus.  Tarik then awoke from his sleep, and, delighted with this good omen, hastened  to communicate the miraculous circumstance to his followers, who were much  pleased and strengthened. T4rik himself was so much struck by the apparition  that from that moment he never doubted of victory.   The same writers have preserved another anecdote, which sufficiently proves  the mediation of the Almighty in permitting that the conquest of Andalus should  be achieved by Térik. Directly after his landing on the rock Miisa’s freedman  brought his forces upon the plain, and began to overrun and lay waste the neigh-  bouring country. While he was thus employed, an old woman from Algesiras””  presented herself to him, and among other things told him what follows: “ Thou  “ must know, O stranger! that I had once a husband who had the knowledge of  “ future events ; and I have repeatedly heard him say to the people of this country  “ that a foreign general would come to this island and subject it to his arms. He  “ described him to me as a man of prominent forehead, and such, I see, is thine ; he  “told me also that the individual designated by the prophecy would have a black  “ mole covered with hair on his left shoulder. Now, if thou hast such a mark on  “thy body, thou art undoubtedly the person intended.”” When Tarik heard the  old woman’s reasoning, he immediately laid his shoulder bare, and the mark being  found, as predicted, upon the left one, both he and his companions were filled  with delight at the good omen.”   Tbnu Hayydn’s account does not materially differ from those of the historians  from whom we have quoted. He agrees in saying that Ily4n, Lord of Ceuta, incited  Misa Ibn Nosseyr to make the conquest of Andalus; and that this he did out of  revenge, and moved by the personal enmity and hatred he had conceived against  Roderic. He makes Térik’s army amount only to seven thousand,” mostly  Berbers,-which, he says, crossed in four vessels provided by Iy4n. According to  his account Térik landed on a Saturday, in the month of Sha’ban of the year ninety-  two,” and the vessels that brought him and his men on shore were immediately  sent back to Africa, and never ceased going backwards and forwards until the whole  of the army was safely landed on the shores of Andalus.   On the other side, Ibnu Khaldtin®' reckons the army under the orders of Tarik",321,book_4,chapter_2
"    268 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book Iv.    at three hundred Arabs, and ten thousand Berbers. He says that before starting on  his expedition Tarik divided his army into two corps, he himself taking the com-  mand of one, and placing the other under the immediate orders of Tarif An-naja’i.*?  Tarik, with his men, landed at the foot of the rock now called Jebalu-l-fatah (the  mountain of the entrance), and which then received his name, and was called  Jebal-Térik (the mountain of Tarik); while his companion Tarif landed on the  island afterwards called after him Jeztrah-Tar(f (the island of Tarif). In order to  provide for the security of their respective armies, both generals selected, soon after  their landing, a good encampment, which they surrounded with walls and trenches,  for no sooner had the news of their landing spread than the armies of the Goths  began to march against them from all quarters.   The precise date of Tarik’s invasion has been differently stated. Some historians,  as Ibnu Khaldtn, content themselves with giving the year, viz., ninety-two (be-  ginning 28th October, 710); others have fixed the month and the day in which this  memorable event is supposed to have taken place. Ibnu-l-khattib places it on Monday,  five days before the end of Rejeb (25th Rejeb) of the year ninety-two (20th June, 711);  Ibnu Hayydn on a Saturday of the month of Sha’b4n: others say on the twenty-  fourth of Rejeb; Adh-dhobi on the eighth day of the same month. There are not  wanting authors who place it at the beginning of the year ninety-three ; but those who  fix it in ninety-two are most in number. God only knows the truth of the case.   pieced by But, to continue our narrative, no sooner did T4rik set his foot in Andalus than  he was attacked by a Goth named Tudmir (Theodomir), to whom Roderic had  intrusted the defence of that frontier. Theodomir, who is the same general who  afterwards gave his name to a province of Andalus, called Beldd Tudmtr® (the  country of Theodomir), having tried, although in vain,** to stop the impetuous  career of Térik’s men, dispatched immediately a messenger to his master, apprising  him how Tarik and his followers had landed in Andalus. He also wrote him a  letter, thus conceived :—‘‘ This our land has been invaded by people whose name,  ‘* country, and origin are unknown to me. I cannot even tell thee whence they  ‘* came,—whether they fell from the skies, or sprang from the earth.”   Roce aster ‘When this news reached Roderic, who was then in the country of the Bashkans   of his kingdom. (Basques), making war in the territory of Banbilénah (Pamplona),*” where serious  disturbances had occurred, he guessed directly that the blow came from LIlydn.  Sensible; however, of the importance of this attack made upon his dominions, he  left what he had in hand, and, moving towards the south with the whole of his   Arrives in Cor- powerful army, arrived in Cordova, which is placed in the centre of Andalus. There   jove he took up his abode in the royal castle, which the Arabs called after him Roderic’s",322,book_4,chapter_2
"    CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 269    castle, and which we have already described in another part of this book.** In this  palace Roderic took up his residence for a few days, to await the arrival of the nume-  rous troops which he had summoned from the different provinces of his kingdom.   They say that while he was staying in Cordova he wrote to the sons of Wittiza  to come and join him against the common enemy ; for although it is true, as we  have already related, that Roderic had usurped the throne of their father and perse-  cuted the sons, yet he had spared their lives ;—since these two sons of Wittiza are  the same who, when Térik attacked the forces of King Roderic on the plains of  Guadalete, near the sea, turned back and deserted their ranks, owing to a promise  made them by Térik to restore them to the throne of their father if they helped  him against Roderic. However, when Roderic arrived in Cordova, the sons of  Wittiza were busily engaged in some distant province collecting troops to march  against the invaders, and he wrote to them to come and join him with their forces, ee  in order to march together against the Arabs; and, cautioning them against the  inconvenience and danger of private feuds at that moment, engaged them to join  him and attack the Arabs in one mass. The sons of Wittiza readily agreed to  Roderic’s proposition, and collecting all their forces came to meet him, and  encamped not far from the village of Shakandah, on the opposite side of the river,°*  and on the south of the palace of Cordova. There they remained for some time,  not daring to enter the capital or to trust Roderic, until at last, having ascertained  the truth of the preparations, and seeing the army march out of the city and him  with it, they entered Cordova, united their forces to his,*? and marched with him  against the enemy, although, as will be seen presently, they were already planning  the treachery which they afterwards committed. Others say that the sons of  Wittiza did not obey the summons sent them by the usurper Roderic ; on the con-  trary, that they joined Térik with all their forces: but which of these reports is the  true one God only knows. However, it seems to have been ascertained that all the  princes of the Goths came to join Roderic in this expedition, although it is equally  true that he was deserted by some of his noblemen on the field of battle. But  much obscurity prevails in the writings of the historians who have recorded the  events of those early times. Even the name of the Gothic monarch at the time of  Tarik’s invasion has been spelt in different ways, for we find it written thus,—  Rudheric, and Ludheric ; although the latter is more commonly used. It is also  stated that he was a descendant from Isbahdn (Hispan);*' but this is contrary to the  accounts of Ibnu Hayydn and others, who say that he was not of royal blood.   When Térik received the news of the approach of Roderic’s army, which is said pipe  to have amounted to nearly one hundred thousand men, provided with all kinds of forcements.  weapons and military stores, he wrote to Miisa for assistance, saying that he had",323,book_4,chapter_2

Musa,  who since TA4rik’s departure for this expedition had been employed in building ships,  and had by this time collected a great many, sent by them a reinforcement of five  thousand Moslems, which, added to the seven thousand of the first expedition, made  the whole forces amount to twelve thousand *? men, eager for plunder and anxious  for battle. Tlyén, Lord of Ceuta, who had become a tributary of the Moslems, was  also sent with his army and the people of his states to accompany this expedi-  tion, and to guide it through the passes in the country, and gather intelligence  for them.   In the meanwhile Roderic was drawing nearer to the Moslems, with all the forces  of the barbarians, their lords, their knights, and their bishops ;** but the hearts of  the great people of the kingdom being against him, they used to see each other  frequently, and in their private conversations they uttered their sentiments about  Roderic in the following manner: ‘‘ This wretch has by force taken possession of  “ the throne to which he is not justly entitled, for not only he does not belong to  ‘‘ the royal family, but he was once one of our meanest menials ; ** we do not  “ know how far he may carry his wicked intentions against us. There is no doubt  ‘* but that Térik’s followers do not intend to settle in this country ; their only wish  ‘is to fill their hands with spoil and then return. Let us then, as soon as the  “battle is engaged, give way, and leave the usurper alone to fight the strangers,  ‘* who will soon deliver us from him; and, when they shall be gone, we can place  “ on the throne him who most deserves it.” *® In these sentiments all agreed, and  it was decided that the proposed plan should be put into execution ; the two sons of  Wittiza, whom Roderic had appointed to the command of the right and left wings  of his army, being at the head of the conspiracy, in.the hope of gaining the throne  of their father.   When the armies drew nearer to each other, the princes began to spin the web of  their treason ; and for this purpose a messenger was sent by them to Tarik, in-  forming him how Roderic, who had been a mere menial and servant to their  father,“’ had, after his death, usurped the throne ; that the princes had by no means  relinquished their rights, and that they implored protection and security for them-  selves. They offered to desert, and pass over to Térik with the troops under their  command, on condition that the Arab general would, after subduing the whole of  Andalus, secure to them all their father’s possessions, amounting to three thousand  valuable and chosen farms, the same that received after this the name of Safdyd-l-",324,book_4,chapter_2

This offer Térik accepted ; and, having agreed to the  conditions, on the next day the sons of Wittiza deserted the ranks of the Gothic  army in the midst of battle, and passed ‘over to Térik, this being no doubt one of  the principal causes of the conquest.   Roderic arrived on the banks of the Guadalete (Wddt-Lek) *° with a formidable roi Ca  army, which most historians compute at one hundred thousand cavalry ; © although eae ete  Ibnu Khaldiéin makes it amount to forty thousand men only. Roderic brought all  his treasures and military stores in carts: he himself came in a litter, placed between  two mules, having over his head an awning® richly set with pearls, rubies, and  emeralds. On the approach of this formidable tempest the Moslems did not lose  courage, but prepared to meet their adversary. Tarik assembled his men, com-  forted them by his words, and after rendering the due praises to the Almighty God,  and returning thanks for what had already been accomplished, proceeded to implore  his mighty help for the future. He then encouraged the Moslems, and kindled  their enthusiasm with the following address.—‘{Whither can you fly,—the enemy IY Técik’s atdren  ‘is in your front, the sea at your back? By Allah! there is no salvation for you  “but in your courage and perseverance.** Consider your situation ;—here you are  “on this island like so many orphans cast upon the world ; you will soon be met  “ by a powerful enemy, surrounding you on all sides like the infuriated billows of a  “ tempestuous sea, and sending against you his countless warriors, drowned ®* in  “steel, and provided with every store and description of arms. What can you  “oppose to them? You have no other weapons than your swords, no provisions  “ but those that you may snatch from the hands of your enemies ; you must there-  “fore attack them immediately, or otherwise your wants will increase, the  “* gales of victory may no longer blow in your favour, and perchance the fear that  “lurks in the hearts of your enemies may be changed into indomitable courage.  “ Banish all fear from your hearts, trust that victory shall be ours, and that the  “ barbarian king will not be able to withstand the shock of our arms.

"    CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 273    shock similar to that of two mountains dashing against each other. King Roderic  came borne on a throne,-and having over his head an awning®’ of variegated silk  to guard him from the rays of the sun, surrounded by warriors cased in bright  steel, with fluttering pennons, and a profusion of banners and standards. TaArik’s  men were differently. arrayed ; their breasts were covered with mail armour, they  wore white turbans on their heads, the Arabian bow** slung across their backs,  their swords suspended to their girdles, and their long spears firmly grasped in  their hands. They say that when the two armies were advancing upon each  other, and the eyes of Roderic fell upon the men in the first ranks, he was horror-  struck, and was heard to exclaim,—“ By the faith of the Messiah! These are the  “ very men I saw painted on the scroll found in the mansion of science at Toledo,”  and from that moment fear entered his heart ; and when-Térik perceived Roderic  he said to his followers, ‘‘ This is the King of the Christians,” °® and he charged  with his men, the warriors who surrounded Roderic being on all sides scattered  and dispersed ; seeing which, Tarik plunged into the ranks of the enemy until he  reached the king, and wounded him with his sword on the head and killed him  on his throne ;* and when Roderic’s men saw their king fall and his body guard  dispersed, the rout became general and victory remained to the Moslems. The  rout of the Christians was complete, for instead of rallying on one spot they fled  in all directions, and, their panic being communicated to their countrymen, cities  opened their gates, and castles surrendered without resistance, &c. The preceding  account we have borrowed from a writer of great note, but we deem it necessary  to warn the readers that the assertion that Roderic died by the hands of Térik ~  has been contradicted by several historians, since his body, although diligently  sought on the field of battle, could nowhere be found; but of this more will be  said in the course of our narrative. We shall proceed to recount in detail that  memorable battle, when Almighty God was pleased to put King Roderic’s army to  flight, and grant the Moslems a most complete victory. ;  Several authors who have described at large this famous engagement state that  Tarik encamped near Roderic, towards the middle of the month of Ramadhén of the  year ninety-two (Sept. a.p. 711), and although there is some difference as to the  dates, all agree that the battle was fought on the banks of the Wadaleke (Guadalete),  in the distriet of Shidhiinah.* They say also that while both armies were encamped  in front of each other, the barbarian king, wishing to ascertain the exact amount  of T4rik’s forces, sent one of his men,“ whose valour and strength he knew,  and in whose fidelity he placed unbounded confidence, with instructions to pene-  trate into Térik’s camp and bring him an account of their number, arms, accoutre-  ments, and vessels. The Christian proceeded to execute his commission, and  VOL. I. 2N",327,book_4,chapter_2
"    Roderic’s fate.    274 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN. [Book Iv.    reached a small elevation whence he had a commanding view of the whole camp.  However, he had not remained long in his place of observation before he was  discovered by some Moslems, who pursued him, but the Christian fled before  them and escaped through the swiftness of his horse. Arrived at the Christian  camp he addressed Roderic in the following words. ‘‘ These people, O King!  “* are the same thou sawest painted on the scroll of the enchanted palace. Beware  ‘‘of them! for the greatest part of them have bound themselves by oath to reach  “thee or die in the attempt; they have set fire to their vessels,® to destroy  “ their last hope of escape ; they are encamped along the sea shore,* determined  “to die or to vanquish, for they know well that there is not in this country a  ‘* place whither they can fly.” On hearing this account King Roderic was much  disheartened, and he trembled with fear. However, the two armies engaged  near the lake or gulf; they fought resolutely on both sides till the right and  left wings of Roderic’s army, under the command of the sons of Wittiza, gave  way. The centre, in which Roderic was, still held firm for awhile, and made  the fate of the battle uncertain for some time; they fled at last, and Roderic  before them. From that moment the rout became general, and the Moslems  followed with ardour the pursuit of the scattered bands, inflicting death wherever  they went. Roderic disappeared in the midst of the battle, and no certain intel-  ligence was afterwards received of him; it is true that some Moslems found his  favourite steed,® a milk-white horse, bearing a saddle of gold sparkling with rubies,  plunged in the mud of the river, as also one of his sandals, adorned with rubies  and emeralds, but the other was never found; nor was Roderic, although diligently  searched for, ever discovered either dead or alive, a circumstance which led the  Moslems to believe that he perished in the stream’; indeed there are not wanting  authors who give it as certain that he died in this manner, and that, while trying  to cross the stream, the weight of his armour” prevented him from struggling  against the current, and he was drowned; but God only knows what became of  him.”   According to Ar-razi, the contest began on a Sunday, two days before the end of  Ramadhan, and continued till Sunday, the fifth of Shawdl, namely, eight whole  days,” at the end of which God Almighty was pleased to put the idolaters to flight  and grant the victory to the Moslems ; and he adds, that so great was the number  of the Goths who perished in the battle, that for a long time after the victory  the bones of the slain were to be seen covering the field of action.   They say also that the spoil found by the Moslems in the camp of the Christians  surpassed all computation, for the princes and great men of the Goths who had  fallen were distinguished by the rings of gold they wore on their fingers, those of an",328,book_4,chapter_2
"    CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 275    inferior class by similar ornaments of silver, while those of the slaves were made of  brass.” ‘Térik collected all the spoil and divided it into five shares or portions,  when, after deducting one-fifth, he distributed the rest amongst nine thousand  Moslems, besides the slaves and followers.   When the people on the other side of the straits heard of this success of Tarik, and Taking of $i.  of the plentiful spoils he had acquired, they flocked to him from all quarters, and Gomis  crossed the sea on every vessel or bark they could lay hold of. Térik’s army being  so considerably reinforced, the Christians were obliged to shut themselves up in  their castles and fortresses, and, quitting the flat country, betake themselves to their  mountains. Tarik first marched against Sidonia,”® which he besieged and took by  force after the garrison had defended it some time. In this city Tarik found con-  siderable spoil. From Sidonia he proceeded to Moror,’* whence he turned towards  Carmona,” and, passing by a fountain which afterwards received his name, he Carmona.  invested that city, which surrendered to him immediately, the inhabitants agreeing  to pay tribute. He next encamped before Ezija, and besieged it. The inhabitants kzije.  being numerous and brave, and having with them some remnants of Roderic’s army,  made at first a desperate defence ; but after a severe battle, in which a great many  Moslems were killed or wounded, it pleased Almighty God to grant them victory,  and the idolaters were put to rout and dispersed. No battle was afterwards fought  in which the Moslems had so much to suffer, for the Christians defended themselves  with the utmost vigour and resolution, and great was the havoc which they made  in the ranks of the faithful. However, the Almighty permitted that Tarik should  notice the governor, a crafty man, much experienced in battle, leave the town and  take, without attendants, the road to the river for the purpose of bathing. Tarik  did not know who he was, but, judging by his arms and his steed, he thought he  might be some person of distinction. No sooner was he aware of it, than, impelled  by his adventurous humour, he took the same direction, repaired to the river, feigned  a purpose similar to that of the barbarian, and, jumping into the water, made him  his prisoner ; he then conducted him to his camp, where the barbarian discovered  himself, and said he was the governor of the city, upon which the Arab general  granted him peace on the usual terms of paying tribute, and dismissed him free to  return to the city, where, as soon as he was returned, he fulfilled his word by  surrendering it to‘the Arabs.   In the meanwhile God filled with terror and alarm the hearts of the idolaters, and  their consternation was greatly increased when they saw Térik penetrate far into  their country ; for, as we have said elsewhere, they were under a belief that his  object in the attack was only to gain spoil and then return to his country. When,  therefore, they saw Térik advance to further conquests they were seized with despair, °    i",329,book_4,chapter_2

It is said  that Térik, too, endeavoured to increase the terror of the Christians by means  of the following stratagem :—he directed his men to cook the flesh of the slain in  presence of the Gothic captives in his camp, and when the flesh had thus been  cooked in large copper vessels he ordered it to be cut up, as if it were to be distri-  buted to his men for their meals ; he after this allowed some of the captives to  escape, that they might report to their countrymen what they had seen. And thus  the stratagem produced the desired effect, since the report of the fugitives contri-  buted in no small degree to increase the panic of the infidels.”",330,book_4,chapter_2

Arrer this they say that Ily4n addressed T4rik in the following words :—“ Since Térk i divides  “thy enemies are panic-struck, and their armies dispersed, proceed to their capital,  “and destroy them before they have time to collect their forces again. Take  “expert guides from among my people; divide thy army into bodies, and send  “them to different parts of the country, and, if thou follow my advice, thou wilt  “ thyself take a division of it and march towards Toledo, where their great men  “are by this time assembled to ce upon their affairs, and unite under a   “ chief of their choosing.” !   Térik assented immediately to the advice given by Iyén, but, before leaving Ezija, Msshey  he dispatched Mugheyth Ar-rimi (the Greek), a freedman of the Sult4n Al-walid, Comdov=  son of ’Abdu-l-malek, with seven hundred horse; for the Moslems by this time  were all, without exception, mounted on horses taken from the barbarians, and  had even some remaining. Mugheyth’s instructions were to attack Cordova, one  of their principal cities. Térik sent another division of his army against Malaga, ’  and a third against Gharnatt4,? the town of Al-birah (Elvira), while he himself, at  the head of the main body, hastened towards Toledo by way of Jaen: some authors  pretend that T4rik himself went to Cordova,> and not Mugheyth, but the former  account is the most certain.   However, those who follow the first opinion relate the affair in the following  manner. They say that Mugheyth’s army, having arrived close to Cordova, en-’  camped in a forest of lofty pines* on the bank® of the river of Shakandah. Having  soon after his arrival at the spot sent out his scouts® to gain if possible a knowledge  of the country, these soon returned with a shepherd, who, being interrogated about",331,book_4,chapter_3
"    278 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book tv.    Cordova, informed Mugheyth that the principal people of the city had quitted it and  gone to Toledo, but that a governor had been left behind with a garrison of four  hundred horsemen, besides the invalids and old soldiers.? The shepherd being  further questioned respecting the walls of the city said that they were strong and  high, but that there was a breach in them, which he described. Accordingly, no  sooner were the Moslems enveloped in the shadows of night than they set off  towards the city, and approached its walls, where God Almighty opened to them the  means of success, by sending a providential fall of hail, which prevented the stepping  of the horses from being heard. The Moslems proceeded gently and unnoticed till  they arrived on the banks of the river,® which they crossed, finding themselves then  at a distance of only thirty cubits, or perhaps less, from the walls. Owing to the  squalls of rain, and the cold of the night, the sentries, neglecting their duties, were  not on the walls keeping guard, a circumstance which allowed the Moslems to arrive  unheard and unmolested at the foot of the battlements; they then attempted to  scale the walls, but failed in their attempt by not finding a place to fix the  ladders. In this difficulty they returned to the shepherd, and asked him to lead  them to the breach he had mentioned ; this the man did, but it was also found upon  trial not to be of easy ascent. However, this was after some time obtained by  means of a fig tree, growing close to the walls, the branches of which afforded the  means of ascending. One of their strongest men mounted the tree, whence he  succeeded in gaining the top of the breach. Mugheyth then unfolded his turban,  and gave one end of it to the man, who by means of it succeeded in helping others  on until a considerable number of Moslems gained the summit of the wall.  Mugheyth, who remained on horseback at the foot of the battlements, then com-  manded the assailant party to rush upon the guard within the city. This order was  quickly obeyed by the Moslems, who surprised and killed many of the garrison,  and, breaking open the gate, let in Mugheyth and the rest of his men, who soon got  possession of the city. This being done, Mugheyth, with his guides, hastened  towards the palace of the governor, who, having received intelligence of the entry of  the Moslems, fled with his guards, four hundred in number, and betook himself to a  church situate at the west® of the city, and fortified himself in it. As water was  conveyed under ground to this church from a spring at the foot of a neighbouring  mountain, the besieged defended themselves some time against Mugheyth, who  nevertheless ruled in the city and its environs.   The same authors, namely, those who pretend that Té4rik was not present at the  taking of Cordova, and that this exploit was achieved singly by Mugheyth, state  that this latter general, after writing to Tarik to apprise him of his victory, con-  tinued to besiege the Christians shut up in the church. After three months of siege,",332,book_4,chapter_3
"    cHaP. 111.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 279    seeing that he could not reduce them, Mugheyth began to grow impatient and  melancholy, and thought of devising some stratagem that might make him master  of the fortress. He then called before him one of his black slaves, whose name  was Rabéh,’° a man of tried courage and fortitude, and directed him to hide  himself at night in a garden covered with trees"" that lay close to the church, to try  if he could not by chance lay hold of some barbarian, who might inform him of the  state of the garrison. The black man did as he was ordered, but being a stupid  fellow he soon committed himself; for as it was then the season for the trees to bear  fruit, and the place was covered with them, he mounted one in order to gather  some fruit, and eat of it. While he was thus perched in the tree he was discovered  by the people of the church, who, coming to the spot, made him get down, and  having secured him took him prisoner inside. Great was the fright, and at the  same time the astonishment, which the sight of the black man caused to the  Christians, for they had never seen a man of his colour before ; they surrounded him  on every side, they gazed at him with astonishment, and thinking he was painted or  dyed with some substance that made him look black, they rushed along, he in the  midst of them, towards the subterranean conduit by means of which the garrison  was supplied with water; and there they began washing and scraping him with  water and a hard brush"" till the black man, unable to endure the operation any  longer, begged them to desist, and explained to them that he was a human creature  like themselves; which being understood by them they left off washing him,  although they still continued to stare at him as a thing they had never seen before.  However, after seven days’ imprisonment, during which the Christians never ceased  coming round him and looking at him, the Almighty permitted that one night this  black man should effect his escape, and arrive safe at the camp of the Amir  Mugheyth, to whom he related his adventures, informing him at the same time of  the result of his observations, as well as of the direction of the subterranean conduit  which supplied the garrison with water. Immediately after Mugheyth summoned  before him some expert people, who looked for the conduit in the place pointed out  by the black man, and, having found it, succeeded in stopping it; the church was  from that moment deprived of water, and its garrison doomed to death.  Notwithstanding this loss, and that the besieged had no hopes of deliverance,  they were so obstinate that when safety was offered to them upon condition either  of embracing the Mohammedan religion, or paying tribute, they refused to surrender,  and the church being set on fire they all perished in the flames. This was the  cause of the spot being called ever since Kentsatu-l-harakt (the church of the  burning),'* as likewise of the great veneration in which it has always been held  by the Christians, on account of the courage and endurance displayed in the cause",333,book_4,chapter_3

However, he had not remained long in his place of observation before he was  discovered by some Moslems, who pursued him, but the Christian fled before  them and escaped through the swiftness of his horse. Arrived at the Christian  camp he addressed Roderic in the following words. ‘‘ These people, O King!  “* are the same thou sawest painted on the scroll of the enchanted palace. Beware  “of them! for the greatest part of them have bound themselves by oath to reach  “‘thee or die in the attempt; they have set fire to their vessels,* to destroy  “their last hope of escape ; they are encamped along the sea shore, determined  “to die or to vanquish, for they know well that there is not in this country a  ‘* place whither they can fly.” On hearing this account King Roderic was much  disheartened, and he trembled with fear. However, the two armies engaged  near the lake or gulf ;®’ they fought resolutely on both sides till the right and  left wings of Roderic’s army, under the command of the sons of Wittiza, gave  way. The centre, in which Roderic was, still held firm for awhile, and made  the fate of the battle uncertain for some time; they fled at last, and Roderic  before them. From that moment the rout became general, and the Moslems  followed with ardour the pursuit of the scattered bands, inflicting death wherever  they went. Roderic disappeared in the midst of the battle, and no certain intel-  ligence was afterwards received of him; it is true that some Moslems found his  favourite steed, a milk-white horse, bearing a saddle of gold sparkling with rubies,  plunged in the mud of the river, as also one of his sandals, adorned with rubies  and emeralds, but the other was never found ; nor was Roderic, although diligently  searched for, ever discovered either dead or alive, a circumstance which led the  Moslems to believe that he perished in the stream’; indeed there are not wanting  authors who give it as certain that he died in this manner, and that, while trying  to cross the stream, the weight of his armour” prevented him from struggling  against the current, and he was drowned ; but God only knows what became of  him.”   According to Ar-razi, the contest began on a Sunday, two days before the end of  Ramadhan, and continued till Sunday, the fifth of Shaw4l, namely, eight whole  days,” at the end of which God Almighty was pleased to put the idolaters to flight  and grant the victory to the Moslems; and he adds, that so great was the number  of the Goths who perished in the battle, that for a long time after the victory  the bones of the slain were to be seen covering the field of action.   They say also that the spoil found by the Moslems in the camp of the Christians  surpassed all computation, for the princes and great men of the Goths who had  fallen were distinguished by the rings of gold they wore on their fingers, those of an",336,book_4,chapter_3

Tarik collected all the spoil and divided it into five shares or portions,  when, after deducting one-fifth, he distributed the rest amongst nine thousand ™*  Moslems, besides the slaves and followers.   When the people on the other side of the straits heard of this success of Tarik, and Taking of Si,  of the plentiful spoils he had acquired, they flocked to him from all quarters, and done  crossed the sea on every vessel or bark they could lay hold of. Tarik’s army being  so considerably reinforced, the Christians were obliged to shut themselves up in  their castles and fortresses, and, quitting the flat country, betake themselves to their  mountains. ‘Térik first marched against Sidonia,’”> which he besieged and took by  force after the garrison had defended it some time. In this city Tarik found con-  siderable spoil. From Sidonia he proceeded to Moror,”* whence he turned towards  Carmona,” and, passing by a fountain which afterwards received his name, he Carmona.  invested that city, which surrendered to him immediately, the inhabitants agreeing  to pay tribute. He next encamped before Ezija, and besieged it. The inhabitants Bzija  being numerous and brave, and having with them some remnants of Roderic’s army,  made at first a desperate defence ; but after a severe battle, in which a great many  Moslems were killed or wounded, it pleased Almighty God to grant them victory,  and the idolaters were put to rout and dispersed. No battle was afterwards fought  in which the Moslems had so much to suffer, for the Christians defended themselves  with the utmost vigour and resolution, and great was the havoc which they made  in the ranks of the faithful. However, the Almighty permitted that Tarik should  notice the governor, a crafty man, much experienced in battle, leave the town and  take, without attendants, the road to the river for the purpose of bathing. Tarik  did not know who he was, but, judging by his arms and his steed, he thought he  might be some person of distinction. No sooner was he aware of it, than, impelled  by his adventurous humour, he took the same direction, repaired to the river, feigned  a purpose similar to that of the barbarian, and, jumping into the water, made him  his prisoner ; he then conducted him to his camp, where the barbarian discovered  himself, and said he was the governor of the city, upon which the Arab general  granted him peace on the usual terns of paying tribute, and dismissed him free to  return to the city, where, as soon as he was returned, he fulfilled his word by  surrendering it to‘the Arabs.   In the meanwhile God filled with terror and alarm the hearts of the idolaters, and  their consternation was greatly increased when they saw Térik penetrate far into  their country ; for, as we have said elsewhere, they were under a belief that his  object in the attack was only to gain spoil and then return to his country. When,  therefore, they saw Térik advance to further conquests they were seized with despair, °",337,book_4,chapter_3

It is said  that T4rik, too, endeavoured to increase the terror of the Christians by means  of the following stratagem :—he directed his men to cook the flesh of the slain in  presence of the Gothic captives in his camp, and when the flesh had thus been  cooked in large copper vessels he ordered it to be cut up, as if it were to be distri-  buted to his men for their meals ; he after this allowed some of the captives to  escape, that they might report to their countrymen what they had seen. And thus  the stratagem produced the desired effect, since the report of the fugitives contri-  buted in no small degree to increase the panic of the infidels.”",338,book_4,chapter_3

Take   “expert guides from among my people; divide thy army into’ bodies, and send   “them to different parts of the country, and, if thou follow my advice, thou wilt   “thyself take a division of it and march towards Toledo, where their great men   “are by this time assembled to deliberate upon their affairs, and unite under a   “ chief of their choosing.”   Térik assented immediately to the advice given by Ily4n, but, before leaving Ezija, Muetey™  he dispatched Mugheyth Ar-rém{ (the Greek), a freedman of the Sult4n Al-walid, Cordove.  son of ’Abdu-l-malek, with seven hundred horse; for the Moslems by this time  were all, without exception, mounted on horses taken from the barbarians, and  had even some remaining. Mugheyth’s instructions were to attack Cordova, one  of their principal cities. Térik sent another division of his army against Malaga,’  and a third against Gharnattd,? the town of Al-birah (Elvira), while he himself, at  the head of the main body, hastened towards Toledo by way of Jaen: some authors  pretend that Térik himself went to Cordova,? and not Mugheyth, but the former  account is the most certain.   However, those who follow the first opinion relate the affair in the following  manner. They say that Mugheyth’s army, having arrived close to Cordova, en-’  camped in a forest of lofty pines * on the bank® of the river of Shakandah. Having  soon after his arrival at the spot sent out his scouts® to gain if possible a knowledge  of the country, these soon returned with a shepherd, who, being interrogated about",339,book_4,chapter_3
"    278 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book Iv.    Cordova, informed Mugheyth that the principal people of the city had quitted it and  gone to Toledo, but that a governor had been left behind with a garrison of four  hundred horsemen, besides the invalids and old soldiers.7?_ The shepherd being  further questioned respecting the walls of the city said that they were strong and  high, but that there was a breach in them, which he described. Accordingly, no  sooner were the Moslems enveloped in the shadows of night than they set off  towards the city, and approached its walls, where God Almighty opened to them the  means of success, by sending a providential fall of hail, which prevented the stepping  of the horses from being heard. The Moslems proceeded gently and unnoticed till  they arrived on the banks of the river,® which they crossed, finding themselves then  at a distance of only thirty cubits, or perhaps less, from the walls. Owing to the  squalls of rain, and the cold of the night, the sentries, neglecting their duties, were  not on the walls keeping guard, a circumstance which allowed the Moslems to arrive  unheard and unmolested at the foot of the battlements; they then attempted to  scale the walls, but failed in their attempt by not finding a place to fix the  ladders. In this difficulty they returned to the shepherd, and asked him to lead  them to the breach he had mentioned ; this the man did, but it was also found upon  trial not to be of easy ascent. However, this was after some time obtained by  means of a fig tree, growing close to the walls, the branches of which afforded the  means of ascending. One of their strongest men mounted the tree, whence he  succeeded in gaining the top of the breach. Mugheyth then unfolded his turban,  and gave one end of it to the man, who by means of it succeeded in helping others  on until a considerable number of Moslems gained the summit of the wall.  Mugheyth, who remained on horseback at the foot of the battlements, then com-  manded the assailant party to rush upon the guard within the city. This order was  quickly obeyed by the Moslems, who surprised and killed many of the garrison,  and, breaking open the gate, let in Mugheyth and the rest of his men, who soon got  possession of the city. This being done, Mugheyth, with his guides, hastened  towards the palace of the governor, who, having received intelligence of the entry of  the Moslems, fled with his guards, four hundred in number, and betook himself to a  church situate at the west® of the city, and fortified himself in it. As water was  conveyed under ground to this church from a spring at the foot of a neighbouring  mountain, the besieged defended themselves some time against Mugheyth, who  nevertheless ruled in the city and its environs.   The same authors, namely, those who pretend that T4rik was not present at the  taking of Cordova, and that this exploit was achieved singly by Mugheyth, state  that this latter general, after writing to Tarik to apprise him of his victory, con-  tinued to besiege the Christians shut up in the church. After three months of siege,",340,book_4,chapter_3
"    CHAP. I1I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 279    seeing that he could not reduce them, Mugheyth began to grow impatient and  melancholy, and thought of devising some stratagem that might make him master  of the fortress. He then called before him one of his black slaves, whose name  was Rabdh, a man of tried courage and fortitude, and directed him to hide  himself at night in a garden covered with trees"" that lay close to the church, to try  if he could not by chance lay hold of some barbarian, who might inform him of the  state of the garrison. The black man did as he was ordered, but being a stupid  fellow he soon committed himself ; for as it was then the season for the trees to bear  fruit, and the place was covered with them, he mounted one in order to gather  some fruit, and eat of it. While he was thus perched in the tree he was discovered  by the people of the church, who, coming to the spot, made him get down, and  having secured him took him prisoner inside. Great was the fright, and at the  same time the astonishment, which the sight of the black man caused to the  Christians, for they had never seen a man of his colour before ; they surrounded him  on every side, they gazed at him with astonishment, and thinking he was painted or  dyed with some substance that made him look black, they rushed along, he in the  midst of them, towards the subterranean conduit by means of which the garrison  was supplied with water; and there they began washing and scraping him with  water and a hard brush” till the black man, unable to endure the operation any  longer, begged them to desist, and explained to them that he was a human creature  like themselves ; which being understood by them they left off washing him,  although they still continued to stare at him as a thing they had never seen before.  However, after seven days’ imprisonment, during which the Christians never ceased  coming round him and looking at him, the Almighty permitted that one night this  black man should effect his escape, and arrive safe at the camp of the Amir  Mugheyth, to whom he related his adventures, informing him at the same time of  the result of his observations, as well as of the direction of the subterranean conduit  which supplied the garrison with water. Immediately after Mugheyth summoned  before him some expert people, who looked for the conduit in the place pointed out  by the black man, and, having found it, succeeded in stopping it; the church was  from that moment deprived of water, and its garrison doomed to death.  Notwithstanding this loss, and that the besieged had no hopes of deliverance,  they were so obstinate that when safety was offered to them upon condition either  of embracing the Mohammedan religion, or paying tribute, they refused to surrender,  and the church being set on fire they all perished in the flames. This was the  cause of the spot being called ever since Kentsatu-l-harakt (the church of the  burning),'> as likewise of the great veneration in which it has always been held  by the Christians, on account of the courage and endurance displayed in the cause",341,book_4,chapter_3

Their commander, however, did    not share their fate, for, when he perceived that the case was desperate, and saw  that he and his followers were doomed to certain death, he abandoned his com-  rades to their fate and escaped towards Toledo. But Mugheyth, being informed of  it, galloped off immediately in pursuit of him, and overtook him near the village of  Talavera.* They say that the barbarian rode a black steed,’® a noble and swift  animal, and that when he saw Mugheyth close at his heels he was terrified and  spurred his horse, but the beast gave a start and threw him down. When  Mugheyth came up he found him stunned by the fall and lying on his shield as if  he were dead, seeing which he took possession of his arms and made him prisoner.   This feat of arms of Mugheyth is differently related by the historians. They all  agree, it is true, in the taking of the church after a considerable resistance, and the  flight and capture of the governor, but some relate this event as having happened  before, not after, the reduction of the fortified church, and say that after taking  the governor prisoner Mugheyth invested the building where the Christians had  taken refuge, and, having reduced it, put every one of them to the sword: the  same historians asserting that the church was called ever since Kentsatu-l-asrat  (the church of the captives). Be this as it may, certain it is that Mugheyth made  the governor of Cordova prisoner, and’ spared his life with the intention of pre-  senting him to the Khalif Al-walid on his return to the East, this Christian being  the only captive of the royal blood of the Goths taken at the time of the conquest,  the rest having either surrendered on terms which secured them their liberty or  escaped to Galicia. However, as we shall presently see, Mugheyth was not able  to accomplish his purpose, for some time afterwards a dispute having arisen between  him and Misa as to whose province it was to present the royal captive to the  Khalif, the latter, seeing that he could not prevail upon Mugheyth to relinquish  his prize, slew the Gothic slave in the very presence of his master. .   After the taking of Cordova, Mugheyth assembled all the Jews in the city and  left them in charge of it, trusting them in preference to the Christians, on account  of their hatred and animosity towards the latter. He then fixed his abode in the  palace, and left the rest of the town to be inhabited by the Moslems.   In the meanwhile the forces that proceeded against Malaga '* took possession of  that town, the barbarians flying for refuge to the neighbouring mountains. After  this they joined the army dispatched to Elvira, and laying siege to its city, Ghar-  nattah,’”” took it by storm. The citadel of this latter place they intrusted to the  care of the Jews, and this practice became almost general in the succeeding years ;  for whenever the Moslems conquered a town, it was left in custody of the Jews,  with only a few Moslems, the rest of the army proceeding to new conquests,",342,book_4,chapter_3
"    CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. . 281    and where Jews were deficient a proportionally greater body of Moslems was  left in charge.'® This plan was equally adopted with regard to the district of  Rayah, to which Malaga belonged.   After the subjection of these two cities, the army proceeded on to Tudmir, ag""!  country so called after its king (Theodomir), and the citadel of which was Ouriwwélah  (Orihuela),'® a place renowned for its strength. This King Tudmir (Theodomir) was  aman of great experience and judginent, who for a length of time defended his  states valiantly.” But at last, having ventured a battle in the open country, he was  completely defeated, and most of his men slain, himself and a few followers only  succeeding in gaining Orihuela. When safe inside the town, he ordered the  women to let their hair loose, to arm themselves with bows, and to appear on  the walls as if they were so many warriors prepared for battle, he himself,  with his scanty followers, standing in front, with a view to deceive the Mos-  lems with regard to the real strength of the garrison. In this stratagem he Besieged in  succeeded, for the Moslems, overrating his forces by the numbers they saw on  the walls, offered him peace, and Theodomir, feigning to accept of it, repaired  in disguise to the camp of the Moslems; and there, as if he were a deputy from  his own people, he first treated for the security of the inhabitants, and afterwards  for his own. When he had brought the Moslems to grant him the terms which  he wished for, he made himself known to them, giving as an excuse for his  stratagem the great love he had for his subjects, and his ardent wish of obtaining  for them a favourable capitulation. He then guided them into the town, according Capitulates.  to the treaty agreed upon, but when the Moslems saw that there were in it only  women and children, they were very much ashamed of themselves, and mortified  at having been deceived. They, however, observed faithfully the terms of the  treaty, as it was their custom to do on every occasion; so that the district of  Tudmir, by the artifice of its king, was freed from the invasions of the Moslems,  and the whole of its towns and villages were comprised in the same capitulation.  The Moslems wrote to Térik, apprising him of the surrender of that district,  and a small portion of the army remaining in the capital of the country, the  test proceeded to Toledo to join in the siege of that city.”   The taking of Malaga and Granada by Térik’s lieutenants has been called into  question by some historians, who attribute it, together with that of Valencia,  Denia, and other cities of the eastern district, to ’Abdu-l-a’la, one of Miisa’s  sons, who landed in Andalus with his father some time after. Even the war made  against Theodomir, and the treaty concluded with him, are by some postponed  until the year ninety-four (beginning 6th October, 712).

But God only knows which of these is the true account, for there is so much  discrepancy in the writings of ancient authors, that to choose among their con-  tradictory accounts becomes a task of the greatest difficulty for the modern  historian.*  sicee Mtoleta While these events were taking place, Térik, according to Ibnu Hayydn, reached  by Tarik. Toledo, the court and capital of the Gothic monarchy, and found it deserted, the  inhabitants having fled and betaken themselves to a town dependent on it beyond  the mountains.* Tarik collected together the Jews of the place, and, leaving  behind a body of his troops in charge of the city, marched with the remainder  in pursuit of the fugitives. He took the road of W4da-l-hijérah (the river of the  stones) ;?° he then came to a range of mountains, which he crossed at a pass named  after himself (Fej-Térik),?” and arrived at Medinatu-l-méyidah (the city of the table),  beyond the mountains, this city being so called from a table which Tarik found in  it, and which is supposed to have belonged to Suleymén, son of Daétid. The colour  / of it was green, and its sides and feet, the latter of which are represented as three  hundred and sixty-five in number,* were made of solid emerald. Tarik took pos-  session of this inestimable jewel, and proceeded to the city beyond the mountains in  which the people had fortified themselves,” and where he also acquired many pre-  cious objects and considerable treasures, after which he did not push his conquests  any further, but returned to Toledo in the year ninety-three * (beginning October,  A.D. 711), although some authors are of opinion that he did not return this time,  but, on the contrary, invaded the country of Galicia, and traversed it till he arrived  as far as Astorga, which he subdued, as well as the neighbouring country, and then  came back to Toledo. But God only knows which of these two opinions is the true  one. It is even said that all these conquests were achieved by Térik against the  express injunctions of his master Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, who, hearing of his success  on the banks of the Guadalete, sent him orders not to advance any further into the  country, but to stop where he was. Be this as it may, one thing is certain, namely,  that Térik went on subduing and conquering the country till the arrival of his  master Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, as we shall afterwards have occasion to relate.*'  arrene""’ ‘The spoils collected by Tarik in his expedition to Toledo are universally repre-  sented as almost innumerable, and as baffling all description by the richness of their  materials, and their admirable workmanship.

But to return to the main subject of our  narrative.   According to Ibnu Hayyén and other historians, when Térik had defeated the Miss preveres  entire forces of the Gothic empire, with King Roderic at their head, on the banks ” so  of the Guadalete, he hastened to communicate to his master Misa Ibn Nosseyr |  the news of the signal victory which God Almighty had granted to his arms.  But, instead of congratulating himself upon his freedman’s success, the Arabian  Amir grew jealous and spiteful, and, fearing lest, by prosecuting the conquest,  Tarik should take all the spoil and the glory to himself, and leave none for him,  sent Tarik a severe reprimand because he had attacked without his orders, together  with an injunction not to move from where he was until he should join him.  Accordingly, having made a few hasty preparations, he crossed over to Andalus,  leaving his eldest son ’Abdullah to command at Cairwan in his stead, and, taking  with him Habib Ibn ’Abdah Al-fehri, and three of his other sons, Merwan,  *Abdu-l-a’la, and ’Abdu-l-’aziz, landed on the coast of Andalus in the month of  Ramadhén of the year ninety-three (August, a.p. 712), or, according to others,  in the month of Rejeb of the same year (June, a.p. 712). The number of troops  which Musa led to this expedition has been differently calculated ; some say ten  thousand men, others say eighteen,®* others make their number still more con-  siderable. Muisa brought in his suite several noble Arabs of the best families of  Yemen, and the countries subject to the Moslems. In their number came several  of the ¢dbi’s (followers), as Hansh™* Ibn ’Abdillah As-san’4ni, ’Abdu-r-rahman  Tbn ’Abdillah Ibn Yezid Al-bajeli, ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Shamdsah* Al-misri,  Abi-l-nadhar Hayyan Ibn Abi Hoblah,* a mauli of the Beni ’Abdi-d-dar ; some  add Jebel Ibn Hasanah*’ and others, to complete the number of twenty-five.

He  therefore determined to hasten to Andalus, and punish his freedman for advancing  against his express orders. He sailed from Ceuta, and, avoiding the mountain  where Tarik had landed, disembarked at a spot which was since called after him  Jebal-Misa* (the mountain of Misa). Thence he proceeded to Algesiras, where  he is said to have expressed his wish not to follow the same route which Tarik had  taken. Some of Ilydn’s people,” who served him as guides, then told him, ‘‘ We  “* will take thee a shorter road than his, and conduct thee to cities more populous  “‘ and wealthy than those which he has conquered ; cities, too, which no conqueror  “‘ has yet subdued, but which, if such be God’s will, will surrender to thee.”  Delighted with this account Misa followed his guides, for the idea of having been  outstripped by Térik in the conquest annoyed him much. They led him along the  coast of Shidhinah (Sidonia),*° which place he took by storm, the inhabitants  imploring his mercy ; thence he proceeded to Karmtinah (Carmona),*' the strongest  city in Andalus, and the best calculated for defence against a besieging enemy, but  he gained it through a stratagem which he devised. Ilydn’s people entering it as  if they were a small body of friends fleeing from the enemy, they approached it in  the night, when, throwing the gates open, they admitted the Moslems, who rushed  upon the guards, and made themselves masters of the town.*? Misa next pro-  ceeded to Seville, the largest and most important city of Andalus for its buildings  and its ancient remains. It had been the capital of the country in ancient times,  and remained such until the conquest of Andalus by the Goths, at which time  these transferred the seat of government to Toledo, as we have observed elsewhere ;  still the heads of the church resided there,** and Seville was considered one of  the principal cities in Andalus. Owing to this the city withstood for some  time** the attacks of Misa, but at last that general entered it by force of  arms, and the barbarians fled to Bajah (Beja). Musa collected the Jews in the  citadel, and left a body of his own troops for the defence of the place, he himself  passing on to Merida, which had also been formerly the seat of government under  some of the kings of the country. This city was of considerable size and great  strength; in it were the remains of palaces, temples of vast size and exquisite  workmanship; and other public buildings. Musa laid siege to it, but the people,  being brave and determined, repulsed the Moslems several times with great loss.  Miisa then had a war-engine* constructed, by means of which the Moslems  approached one of the towers under cover, and began undermining the wall; but  this also proved ineffectual, for no sooner had they begun to displace and remove  the stones than they found themselves in an open space, a kind of work which the  barbarians call in their language Al-eshah meshah:** having there laid down‘’ their",346,book_4,chapter_3

After this Misa offered to treat with the besieged on terms  of peace; accordingly a deputation, composed of the principal inhabitants, came  forth from the city to settle with him the conditions. Having obtained a safe  conduct the deputies reached the camp of the Moslems, where Mtisa made use  of the following stratagem to deceive and astonish them: he received them the  first time with his white hair and beard both undressed. Not having agreed  then, the deputies returned back to the city, and appeared again before him on  the day before the feast of Al-fitr;** but what was their astonishment to behold  his beard, which he had tinged with hinna,“ dyed of deep red, resembling  that of the branches of the ’arfaj.° Again not having come to a perfect under-  standing, the deputies returned to the city, and when they came to visit Misa  the next day, they were still more astonished to see his hair and beard entirely «  black, a circumstance which filled them with amazement, for the barbarians were \  totally unacquainted with the practice of staining and dressing the beard. When |  they went back to the city they said to their countrymen, ‘“‘ Know ye that we have   “ to fight a nation of prophets,*' who can change their appearance at pleasure, and  “transform themselves into any shape they like. We have seen their king, who  “was an old man, become a young one; so our advice is this, that we should   “‘ go to him and grant him his demands, for people like them we cannot resist.” *?  To this the people submitted, and peace was concluded with Misa on the following  conditions, namely, that the property of all citizens slain during the siege, as well   as that of those who had fled to Galicia, together with all the riches and ornaments   of the churches, should be given up to the Moslems, but that to all others residing   in the city at the time of the capitulation should be left the undisturbed possession   of their property. Upon these terms the city surrendered on the day of the festival   of Al-fitr, of the year ninety-four (beginning 6th October, 712).   In the meantime, and while Misa was occupied in the conquest of Merida, the Rebellion a  inhabitants of Seville, assisted by those of Beja and Liblah (Niebla), revolted against  the Moslems, and killed about eighty men belonging to the garrison ; in consequence  of which, after the surrender of Merida, Musa dispatched his son ’Abdu-l-’aziz with  an army against the insurgents. He first marched to Seville, which he took,  making great slaughter among its inhabitants ; he then proceeded to Niebla, which  he reduced also, and, after re-establishing his authority and upholding Islam in  those districts, came back to Seville, where he fixed himself, making it the capital  of the Mohammedan conquests.”",347,book_4,chapter_3
"    Masa goes to  Toledo.    The table of  Suleyman  described.    286 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book tv.    About the end of the month of Shaww4l® of the same year (ninety-four), Misa  left Merida to go to Toledo, and when Térik was informed of his arrival he went  out to receive him with his principal officers, and met him in the district of Talavera.  This is according to some historians, for others say that from Merida he proceeded to  Galicia, which he entered by the mountain pass called Fej-Tdrik (the pass of Tarik) ,*  and traversed the whole of that country until he overtook Térik, the leader of the  van of his army, at Astorga. But the former account is the most probable, besides  being adopted by the best writers. All agree, however, that Misa’s reception of  his freedman was both unnatural and unjust,—that he reprimanded him severely for  advancing contrary to his orders into the heart of the country, and manifested in  public all the envy and animosity he had conceived against him. They say, also,  that the moment Térik perceived his master he alighted from his horse, out of  respect, and to do him honour, but that Misa struck him with his whip,”  reproached him with his disobedience, and upbraided him before all the army  for acting against his orders. He then took Térik with him to Toledo, where  he summoned him to produce all the spoil gained from the enemy at the taking  of that town, and especially the famous table of Suleyman, son of David, for which  he seemed to wish more eagerly than for any other article found at the time of the  conquest.   We have already said something on this inestimable jewel, descriptions of which  are to be met with in almost every book on the history or geography of Andalus.  These, however, are not all alike, since by some the materials of the table are said  to be pure gold, by others green emerald. Some describe it as being made of gold  and silver, and having round it a row of pearls, another of rubies, and a third of  emeralds, and being, besides, strewed with innumerable precious gems ; others make  its substance to be solid emerald, and pretend that it had three hundred and sixty-  five feet ; others again say that it was all set with a variety of precious stones, and  incrusted with all sorts of aromatic woods, and that the whole was covered with  inscriptions in Greek. But as that trustworthy and accurate historian, Ibnu  Hayy4n, has preserved a description of this table, as well as an account of its  origin, we’ shall refer to him.   His words are as follow :—‘ The celebrated table which Tarik found: at Toledo,  “although attributed to Suleyman, and named after him, never belonged to that  “ Prophet, according to the barbarian authors, who give it the following origin.  ‘« They say that in the time of their ancient kings it was customary amongst them  “ for every man of estimation and wealth’ to bequeath, before dying, some of  “‘his property to the churches. From the money so collected the priests caused  “tables to be made of pure gold and silver, besides thrones and huge stands,*®",348,book_4,chapter_3
"    CHAP. 111.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 287    “for the priests, deacons, and attendants to carry the gospels when taken out at  ‘‘ public processions, or to ornament the altars ® on great festivals. By means of  “such bequests this table was wrought at Toledo, and was afterwards emulously in-  “ creased and embellished by each succeeding monarch, the last trying always to sur-  “ pass his predecessors in magnificence, until it became the most splendid and costly  “ jewel that ever was made for such a purpose, and acquired great celebrity. The  “ fabric was of pure gold, set with the most precious pearls, rubies, and emeralds ;  “around it was a row of each of those valuable stones, and the whole table was  “ besides covered with jewels so large and bright that never did human eye behold  “any thing comparable to it. Toledo being the capital of the kingdom, there was  “no jewel, however costly, no article, however precious, which could not be pro-  “cured in it; this and other causes concurred to ornament and embellish that  “ inestimable object. When the Moslems entered Toledo it was found on the great  “altar of their principal church, and the fact of such a treasure having been  “ discovered soon became public and notorious.”   Tarik soon perceived by the haste that his master Misa made to come from  Africa, and his eagerness to demand from him the spoils acquired, that he was  devoured by envy ; he, accordingly, decided upon taking away one of the legs of the  table, which he kept concealed, and which afterwards became, as we shall see, his  principal argument against Musa, when in the presence of the Khalif the latter  disputed with him the possession of this jewel, which he pretended to have found  himself.   Arrived in Toledo, Miisa asked Tarik to produce the table of Suleyman, and the  order being instantly obeyed, it was brought to the presence of the Arabian general,  who, seeing it with only three feet instead of four,®' immediately questioned Tarik  respecting it. Tarik answered, that he had found it thus; upon which Miisa caused  a foot of pure gold, handsomer than which none could be procured, to be wrought ;  and notwithstanding its great disparity, (the other three being made of emerald,) to  be fixed to the table, which he laid carefully up until he should present it himself to  the Khalif Al-walid as the fruit of the Andalusian conquest.   After this Misa is represented as having cast Tarik into prison, and as meditating  his death, which he would have accomplished had not a messenger of the Khalif  arrived in Andalus with orders to set him at liberty, and restore him to the com-  mand of the troops. However, it appears by Ibnu Hayydn’s narrative that he soon  restored to him his confidence and friendship ; when, uniting their forces, they both  proceeded to new conquests, and speedily subdued the remainder of Andalus.",349,book_4,chapter_3

He then  gave him orders to march before him with his division, Misa himself following him  with the main body of the troops. Taking the route of Ath-thagheru-l-a’lt (Aragon),  they subdued Saragossa and its districts, and continued to penetrate far into the  country,’ Tarik preceding him, and not passing a place without reducing it, and  getting possession of its wealth, for God Almighty had struck with terror the hearts  of the infidels, and no one came before him but to ask for peace. Misa followed  the track of Tarik, achieving the conquests begun by him, and confirming to the  inhabitants the conditions agreed upon by his lieutenant. When the whole of that  country had been subdued, such of the Moslems as consulted their safety were of  opinion that they should return, while others, and they were the greater number,  They invade eagerly desired to penetrate into the land of the Franks. Accordingly Musa, after  devoting some time to make the necessary selection of those who volunteered to go  with him from those who preferred remaining, proceeded with the rest to the country  of the Franks, a land where the Moslems after them never ceased making conquests,  gaining spoil, storming cities or granting them peace on the usual terms, till they  reached the river Rodhanoh (Rhone), which was the furthest limit of their con-  quests and incursions in the country of the barbarians. Indeed, the bands which  Tarik had led to Andalus subdued also the country of Afranj, and made them-  selves the masters of the two cities of Barcelona and Narbonne, of the rock of  Abenitin? (Avignon), and of the fortress of Lidhiin (Lyons), on the banks of  the Rhone, the Moslems advancing far into the country and separating them-  selves considerably from the shore by which they had penetrated. The distance  between Narbonne, in the country of Afranj, and Cordova is, according to some,",350,book_4,chapter_4
"    CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 289    three hundred and thirty-five farsangs, according to others, three hundred and  fifty.   How far Misa pushed his conquests into the land of the Franks is not explicitly  related by the historians of Andalus. Some say that after the taking of Saragossa  he went eastwards into the country of the Franks,‘ subduing on his passage  Gerona, Calahorra, Tarragona, Barcelona, and other principal cities of those  districts. Others say that he penetrated as far as Narbonne and Carcassonne,  both of which he subdued. They relate that on his way to one of those cities  he crossed a great desert, where he saw the ruins® of ancient buildings scat-  tered on the ground, and among them a colossal monument, like a-column, rising  high into the air, bearing the following inscriptions engraven in Arabic cha-  racters on the stone. ‘‘O sons of Isma’il, hither you will arrive, hence you must  “return ;” and on the other side, ‘‘ for if you go beyond this stone you will return  “ to your country to make war upon one another, and consume your forces by dis-  “ sensions and civil war.””® Miisa was terrified at the mysterious meaning of these  expressions ; he called his men together, and consulted them as to whether they  should go back or advance beyond the column; the opinions were divided, but  the greater part wishing to return, Miisa followed their advice, and retreated with  his army into Andalus, after having seen enough of the country to judge of the  boundless plains that lay before him.   Tbnu Khaldiin’s words are as follows: ‘‘ Having met his master, Musa Ibn  “ Nosseyr, Térik resigned the command of his troops into his hands, and placed  “himself under his immediate orders. Miuisa then completed the conquest of  “ Andalus, and, led by him, the Moslem armies reached as far as Barcelona in the  “ east, Narbonne in the north, and the idol of Cadiz in the west, subduing all the  “intermediate provinces and gaining incredible spoil. It is confidently believed  “ that, elated with success, Misa conceived the project of returning to the East by  “‘ way of Constantinople ; for which purpose he intended to march from Andalus  “at the head of his brave troops, until, by making his way through the countless  “ Christian nations that inhabit the great continent, he should arrive at the court of  “the eastern Khalifs. However, this design having reached the ears of Al-walid,  “who well knew the state of Mohammedan affairs in Andalus, and feared that if  “ Misa once communicated his intention to his army they would all follow him, he  “ dispatched to him a messenger to signify his displeasure, and to order him to  “desist from his rash enterprise, and to appear alone, without his army, in the  “ Khalif’s presence.” So far Ibnu Khaldin.   Another historian says that Musa penetrated into the continent and reached as  far as a city called Carcassonne, which is twenty-five days’ march from Cordova ;7   VOL. I. 2P",351,book_4,chapter_4

But let us hear Al-hijari in  “his Mas‘hab.   “God Almighty bestowed his favours on Misa Ibn Nosseyr in a manner that  ‘* cannot be surpassed, since he vanquished the Christian kings, and dispersed their  “* armies like the dust, till he penetrated into the continent by one of the gates in  “ that chain of mountains that divides Andalus from Afranj: it is related that the  ‘* Franks flocked immediately under the banners of their great king K4roloh, (for  ‘* such was the appellation of their kings,)° and said to him, ‘ What is the meaning  ‘* of this our ignominy and shame, which will rest as a stigma on our posterity? We  “ hear about these Arabs sprung from the East, and are informed of their conquests  ** and of their arrival in the West, subduing the neighbouring kingdom of Andalus,  “* notwithstanding the numerous armies and considerable resources of that empire ;  ‘* and yet these Arabs, we are told, are scanty in numbers, badly equipped and pro-  ‘‘ vided, and do not wear armour:’ and Kéroloh answered them, ‘ My opinion is  “ that we should not oppose these people in their first irruption, for they resemble  ‘* the mountain torrent, which surmounts every obstacle in its course; they are now  “in the height of prosperity, and, instead of being abated, their courage is only  “increased at the sight of the enemy; their proud hearts scorn the defence of a  “* cuirass. Let them alone until their hands are well loaded with spoil, for when they  “ have settled in this country and established their government, they will then vie  “‘ for command, and fight with one another for the acquisition of it. That will be  “ the time and occasion for our attacking them, and I doubt not but that we shall  “ easily vanquish them :’ and by Allah so it was; for in the civil wars that soon  “ afterwards broke out between the Syrians and the Beladis,’° the Berbers and the  ‘* Arabs, the tribes sprung from Modhar, and those of Yemen, the Moslems divided  ‘* into factions, made war upon each other, and lent each other assistance against  “ the people of their own nation, their brethren in country and religion.”   It is also reported that Musa Ibn Nosseyr sent his son ’Abdu-l-a’la' against  Tudmir, and also against Granada, Malaga, and the district of Raya, which cities  he entirely subdued. On this occasion they tell the following adventure of ’Abdu-  1-a’la at the siege of Malaga. They say that the governor of that city was a stupid —  man, and one who did not much care for the safety of the town. Not liking to  endure the fatigues and privations of the siege, he used to go out to a garden of his,",352,book_4,chapter_4
"    CHAP. IV.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 291    where he retired to enjoy the pleasures of the country. This he did frequently, but  without taking the necessary precautions of appointing scouts or stationary sentries  on places commanding the country, so that he might be informed of ’Abdu-l-a’la’s  arrival. No sooner, therefore, was the Arabian Amir informed of this circumstance  by his spies than he prepared an ambush for him, and concealing a small body  of his best and most experienced horsemen near the walls of the garden where the  governor was, these rushed at night upon the house, surprised him, and made  him their prisoner. The Moslems afterwards took the city by storm, and collected  considerable plunder.   Others, again, say that Miisa was present at all these conquests, and that he    was preparing to attack the land of the infidels,’? the country of Galicia, when aint with    he was prevented by Mugheyth Ar-rimi,'? who was the bearer of an order from his & message from    patron, the Khalif Al-walid, enjoining Miisa to cease his conquests, and, quitting  Andalus, to return to the East with his messenger. This order put a stop to  Misa’s enterprises and marred his intention, for at that time not a single town  remained in Andalus which was not subdued to the Arabs, if we except the country  of Galicia.“ However, Misa had such an ardent wish to push his conquests in  those parts that he prevailed on the envoy, by offering him the half of his own share  of the spoils, to stop until he had accomplished his object, and accompany him a  few days into the heart of the enemy’s country. Mugheyth consented, and marched  with him until he arrived at the frontiers of the enemy’s territory '* and conquered  the fortress of Bézi® and the castle of Lik (Lugo), where they stopped some  time. From thence Miisa sent forward some of his troops, who reached the rock of  Belay (Pelayo),’” on the shores of the Green Sea, destroying on their way all the  churches, and breaking all the bells. The Christians surrendered every where, and  asked humbly for peace, which was granted on condition of their paying tribute.  The Arabs inhabited the towns deserted by the Christians ; for whenever any of the  invaders, whether an Arab or a Berber, received orders to settle in a spot, he not  only approved of it, but established himself with his family in it without reluc-  tance, by means of which the words of Islam spread far into the country, and the  idolatry of the Christians was destroyed and annihilated.   Things were in this state, and Miisa pushing on his conquests into the land of the  Galicians, his hope of success strengthening every day, when a second envoy, whose  name was Abi Nasr, arrived from Syria with orders to stop him in his victorious  career, for the Khalif Al-walid, seeing that his commands were not quickly obeyed,  and that Mugheyth allowed Misa to protract his departure, had now sent this Abi  Nasr with a letter upbraiding Musa, and enjoining him to return immediately, at    Galicia and As-  turias invaded.

After staying for some time at Cairwdn, Misa prepared to march, leaving the  government of Africa proper in the hands of his eldest son ""Abdullah, the conqueror  of Mallorca,” that of Maghreb (Western Africa) in those of ’Abdu-l-malek,* the  youngest of his sons: intrusting to his son ’Abdu-l-a’la the command of the coast,  with the garrisoning of Tangiers and other strong places, he moved on in the  ensuing year (ninety-five), preceded by an immense number of waggons and camels  carrying the immense booty and vast riches he had acquired, in which were com-  prised, besides the famous table, such a quantity of precious stones, silver and gold  vases, and other valuable objects, as to surpass all computation by their number  and baffle all description by their materials. He was also followed by thirty  thousand captives taken in war, but with all this he was affected with melancholy  and disappointment, which are said to have caused his death soon after, owing to  his having been checked in his projects of conquest, since, as we have related  elsewhere, some historians attribute to him the design of reducing such parts of  the country as still remained in the hands of the Franks, and after this of invading  the great land (continent), and arriving with his army in Syria; and this he is  supposed to have planned with a view to establish, by the entire subjection of  the intermediate countries, an open and direct communication with the East, that",354,book_4,chapter_4
"    CHAP. IV.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 293    the people of Andalus might in future receive reinforcements, or visit Syria, without  having to cross the sea and encounter its dangers.   Misa left Africa for Syria in the year ninety-five of the Hijra (beginning Sept. Leases Africa  713), leaving the inhabitants of the towns and villages through which he passed in  utter astonishment at the sight of the immense treasures and numberless curiosities,  being part of the spoil made in Andalus, which preceded him in waggons.   They say that as he was journeying™ towards Syria with his suite, he asked  Mugheyth to deliver into his hands his prisoner, the Gothic nobleman, governor  of Cordova, but this Mugheyth refused to do, answering, ‘‘ Nobody shall present  “him to the Khalif but myself; he is my patron and master, and to him only  “ will I make homage of my prisoner.” Upon which Miisa sprang upon the Goth  and tore him out of the hands of Mugheyth. However, some of his friends having  told him that if he arrived at court with his prisoner, Mugheyth would undoubtedly  claim him before the Khalif, in which case the Goth would not contradict his  assertion, he ordered him to be beheaded, and the sentence was immediately carried  into execution. From this moment Mugheyth conceived a violent hatred against  Misa, and contributed not a little to hurt him afterwards in the mind of the  Khalif by supporting the charges brought against him by Tarik.   Whether Miisa reached Damascus before or after the death of Al-walid is a con- Arve: iv  troverted fact amongst historians. Those who incline to the latter opinion pretend  that Suleyman,” who succeeded his brother in the Khalifate, was ill disposed towards  Misa, owing to charges and complaints laid against him by Tarik and Mugheyth,  who, having preceded him at court, had informed the Khalif of his rapacity and  injustice, and told him how he had appropriated to himself the famous table, and  deprived Mugheyth of his noble captive. Misa was further accused of concealing a  jewel more valuable than any that a king ever possessed since the conquest of Persia.  Accordingly, when Misa arrived in Damascus he found Suleyman very much pre-  judiced against him; that monarch received him angrily, reprimanded him severely,  and cast upon him several imputations and charges, which he tried to answer as well  as he could. He then asked him to produce the table, which being done, Suleyman  said to him, “‘ Térik pretends that it was he, not thou, who found it.” ‘“ Certainly  not,” answered Misa, ‘‘if ever Tarik saw this table, it was in my possession and  “nowhere else.” Then Tarik, addressing the Khalif, requested him to question  Misa about the leg that was wanting, and on Muisa’s answering “‘ that he had  “found it in that state, and that in order to supply the deficiency he had caused  “another leg to be made,” Tarik triumphantly produced from under his tunic  the identical one, which at once convinced Suleyman of the truth of Térik’s  assertion and Miisa’s falsehood. This also led the Khalif to suppose that all the",355,book_4,chapter_4
"    294 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book Iv.    other charges brought against him were equally correct; he therefore deprived  him of all the riches he had acquired, and banished him to a distant province of  his empire: others say that he imprisoned him, and ordered that he should be  kept with the greatest vigilance ;—that he also fined him very heavily, whereby he  became so poor that he was obliged to beg for his subsistence among the Arabs,  the tribe of Lakhm, to which he belonged, having contributed ninety thousand  pieces of gold towards the payment of his fine, which is said to have amounted to  two hundred thousand. Half of this enormous sum Musa paid down, but he failed  in procuring the means of paying the rest, when, having excited the compassion  of Ibnu-l-muhlib,* a favourite of Suleymén, that courtier interceded for him with  the Khalif, who absolved Miisa from the payment of the remainder and par-  doned him, although he gave orders for the removal of ’Abdullah, his eldest son,  from the government of Africa.   panied The historians who follow the former of the two opinions, namely, that Misa  reached Damascus before the death of Al-walid, relate that when Misa arrived  in Syria the Khalif was indisposed, and that when Suleymdn, who was the pre-  sumptive heir, heard of Miisa’s approach, he wrote requesting him to delay his  entry into Damascus until his brother was dead and himself succeeded to his  throne, that the rich spoils he brought with him might grace his inauguration,  and give him popularity among his subjects, who had never seen or heard of  such an accumulation of riches. This Misa refused to do, from motives of  fidelity to his lawful sovereign, and, hastening his march, arrived in Damascus  while Al-wélid was still alive, and delivered into his hands the fifth of all the  spoil, the fruit of his conquests, besides immense treasure and countless wealth,  and many valuable gifts, all the produce of the plunder collected in Andalus.  However, Al-walid died a very few days afterwards, and his successor, Suleyman,   peered vented his rage against Musa, whom he caused to be imprisoned, and exposed to  the sun till he was almost lifeless. He had him also very heavily fined, and wrote  to his generals in Andalus to murder his son ’Abdu-l-’aziz, whom he had left to  command in his name, as has before been said, and who, in his absence, collected  together the scattered bands of the Arabs, fortified the frontiers, and contributed  greatly to consolidate the conquest, by storming many towns which had escaped his  father’s eye.   Of the two preceding accounts the latter is, in our opinion, entitled to most  credit, since there can be no doubt that Misa was imprisoned and fined in the  year ninety-six (beginning September, 714), at the beginning of which Al-walid  died; and therefore what Ibnu Hayy4n says, that it was Suleyman Ibn ’Ab-  di-l-malek who disgraced and imprisoned Misa, is the true account, and not",356,book_4,chapter_4

Al-hijari, who is one of the authors who maintain that Misa was ill treated by Su-  leymén, says, in his Mas‘hab, that Misa Ibn Nosseyr begged Yezid Ibnu-l-muhlib,””  who was a favourite with the commander of the faithful, Suleyman Ibn ’Abdi-l-  malek, to intercede for him that he might be more lenient and better disposed  towards him. ‘ Very willingly,” answered Yezid ; ‘let me only first put to thee a  “ question which I desire thee to answer.” ‘‘ What is it?” said Musa. “I have  “ often,” replied Yezid, “‘ heard people speak of thy superior talents, thy great sa-  “ gacity, and thy deep acquaintance with all the casualties of war, as well as with  “ the sudden changes of fortune ; how is it, then, that after conquering Andalus, and  “ putting a boisterous sea between thee and these people, thou now comest to deliver  “ thyself into their hands, like the man who blushed after he had gained his purpose,  “‘ which had cost him much trouble, or like the man who got the skin, and, after  “ tanning and preparing it with his own hands, gave it to his enemy. How is it, I  “ repeat, that thou hast placed thy person in the hands of people who know nothing  “ but thy good and thy evil?”* Thou hadst become the master of treasures and  “ riches, thou hadst subdued castles and cities, thou wast at the head of a numerous  “army, so that hadst thou only made a show of resistance thou wouldst not now  “ find thy head in the hands of a man who has not the least regard or compassion  “for thee. Besides, how couldst thou forget that Suleymdén was the presumptive  “heir to the empire, he having been designated by Al-walid to be his successor,  ‘“‘and that by his brother’s serious illness this event was daily expected? Thou  “must have been ignorant of it, or else thou wouldst not have opposed his will  “and thrown thyself into his power, causing thy own ruin and perdition, and  “‘ making thyself the mark of the hatred both of thy master and of thy slave  “‘ (meaning Suleyman and Tarik). I may tell thee that it will be very difficult  “to persuade the Khalif to restore thee to his favour; however, I promise to do  “all in my power to obtain it.”   Then Misa said, “‘O Ibnu-l-karam! This is not the moment for reproaches.  “ Hast thou not heard it said, that when the occasion is propitious the fountain  ‘is dry?” ‘* By addressing thee in this manner,” replied Yezid, “it is not my  “intention to offend or upbraid thee; my only wish is to gain a better knowledge  “of thy case, and see how matters stand between thee and Suleyman.” ‘ Hast  “thou not heard,” said Musa, “ of the lapwing that is enabled to see the water at  “‘a great depth under ground, and yet falls into the snare which is in sight of his  “ eyes?”   After this Yezid went to see Suleyman, and spoke to him in favour of Misa, but",357,book_4,chapter_4

Some gave us alms, others  ‘* dismissed us ; some, moved to pity, used to give us one or two dirhems, which  “ caused great satisfaction to the Amir, for he stored them to add to the sum to be  ‘* deposited in the hands of the officers intrusted with the receipt of his fine, in hopes  “ of alleviating his sentence.” Thus was he obliged to beg from door to door,—he  who had seen the meanest soldiers of his army, at the time of the great conquest of  Andalus, enter the palaces and temples, and throw away the gold with which they  were overloaded, in order to seize only on pearls, rubies, and other precious stones.  Praise be given to Him who distributes poverty and wealth as he chooses, and in  ' whose hands are both exaltation and depression !   It is further related, that while Musa was escaping from the violence of the  Khalif, and was in vain seeking an asylum among the Arabs, he found at last in  Wada-l-koré one of his ancient maulis, who, remembering his former engagements,  shared his misfortunes with him, received him in his house, and fed him; until  finding that Misa protracted his stay, and that his means were thereby exhausted,  he determined upon delivering him into the hands of the officers of justice. Musa,  however, guessing his intention, went up to him and addressed him in a very  humble tone of voice, saying to him, ‘ Wilt thou, O friend, betray me in this man-  ney?” and the mauli replied, ‘‘ Against fate there is no complaint. It is not I who  “ betray thee, it is thy master, thy creator, he who gave thee sustenance, who now  “abandons thee.” Upon which Misa raised his eyes, bathed in tears, to the sky,  and humbly besought God to grant him his help and favour in his perilous situation.  On the following day Muisa delivered up his soul.   The author from whom the -preceding is transcribed observes, ‘‘ Whatever  “* Miisa’s faults might have been, certainly he did not deserve so severe a chas-  “tisement. His conduct, and the territories he gained to Islam, ought to have  ‘* moved the heart of Suleyman to pity. And doubtless his ordering ’Abdu-l-’aziz,  ‘* whom Misa had left to command in Andalus, to be beheaded, and his head to be",358,book_4,chapter_4

They say that Suleymdn once asked Mtisa what he had observed in his trans-   actions and wars with the infidels. ‘‘ What nations were they ?” inquired the Khalif.  “ They are more than I can enumerate,” replied Misa. ‘‘ Tell me then about the  “ Greeks,°° what sort of people are they ?”’—‘‘ They are lions behind the walls of  “ their cities, eagles upon their horses, and women in their vessels.. Whenever they  “* see an opportunity they sieze it immediately, but if they are vanquished they fly to  “ the tops of their mountains, being so swift that they scarcely see the land which they  “ tread.””—‘ And the Berbers ?”—‘‘ The Berbers are the people who most resemble  “the Arabs in activity, strength, courage, endurance, love of war, and hospitality,  “only that they are the most treacherous of men. They have no faith, and they  “ keep no word.”— Tell me about the Goths.” *\—*‘ The Goths are lords living in  “Juxury and abundance, but champions who do not turn their backs to the  ‘““enemy.”—‘ And the Franks, what are they ?’”—‘‘ They are people of great  “ courage and enterprise ; their numbers are considerable, and they are amply pro-  “ vided with weapons and military stores.”   However, upon the year of Miisa’s death there is but one opinion. Ac¢ording Muss’s death.  to Ibnu Hayydn, Ibnu Bashkiwal, and other historians, he died at Wada-l-kora,*?  in the year ninety-seven (beginning Sept. a. v. 715); he was born in the  year nineteen of the Hijra (beginning Jan. a.p. 640), during the Khalifate of  Omar Ibnu-l-khatt4b, and therefore was sixty years old when he took possession of  the government of Africa in the year seventy-nine. His surname was Abd ’Abdi‘y-  rahman.* “   As to his ancestors there are various opinions; some authors make him Opinions about  the son of Nosseyr, son of Zeyd, of the tribe of Bekr; others of Nosseyr, son origin. —  of ’Abdu-r-rahman, son of Zeyd, of the same tribe. Ibn Khallekan, following  Al-homaydi and other ancient historians, calls him Misa, son of Nosseyr, a mauli*  of the tribe of Lakhm. Some go so far as to say that he was a Berber of mixed -  blood.   Those who incline to the former opinion say that his father, Nosseyr, drew his  origin from those barbarians who, when defeated by Khaled Ibnu-l-walid near ’Aynu-   VOL. I. 2a",359,book_4,chapter_4

[Book 1v.    n-namar, (the fountain of the panthers,) pretended to be hostages and descendants  of Bekr Ibn Wayil.** Nosseyr became at the time the slave of ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn  Merwan, of the family of Umeyyah, who in the course of time gave him liberty, and  promoted his son Misa in the army, until he bestowed on him the government of  Africa proper. But this is very far from being a settled opinion, for, as we have  already observed, there are not wanting genealogists who make him a mauli of the  tribe of Lakhm, and say that his father, Nosseyr, was captain of the guard *’ of the  Khalif Mu’awiyah Ibn Abi Sufydn, and that when the latter made war against ’Ali,  before the battle of Sefayin, Nosseyr refused to accompany the expedition.. Having  been interrogated by Mu’awiyah as to the cause which prevented him from joining  his army, and made him show himself so ungrateful for past favour, he is said  to have answered, ‘‘It is not in my power to assist thee against one to whom I  “am more indebted than to thee.” ‘“ And who is he?” replied Mu’awiyab.  “ God Almighty!” said Nosseyr. Hearing this Mu’awiyah turned his back upon  him in great anger, but he is said to have afterwards asked God’s pardon, and to  have implored his mercy upon the deceased.   Be this as it may, in one thing we find all historians agree, namely, that Musa  was a mauli of ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Merwaén, of the royal family of Umeyyah, and  viceroy of Egypt and Africa in his brother ’Abdu-l-malek’s name. It was he  who gave him command in the army, promoted him, and appointed him at last  to the government of Cairwén and the African conquests. When the Khalif  Al-walid married his niece Ummu-l-baneyn,** Misa was intrusted by her father  *Abdu-l-’aziz with the care of taking her to the house of her royal spouse ; hence  the high favour he always enjoyed with the Khalif, until, by his death, things  were entirely changed.   There are not wanting historians, as Ibnu Bashktwal and Ibnu-l-faradhi, who  count Misa in the number of the ¢dbi’s (followers of the companions) of the  Prophet, asserting that he preserved many of the traditions delivered by the  individuals of that illustrious body, that he quoted Temim Ad-dari*® as his  authority, and was himself quoted by Yezid Ibn Masrék Al-yahsebi. This Ibnu  Bashkiwal affirms on the authority of Misa’s own son,*° who wrote a book with  the following title, Kitdbu-l-aymati mina-l-musanafin (a treatise on the principal  authors of traditional collections), in which he collected particulars respecting the life  of every one of them,—‘‘ a work,” observes Ibnu Bashkiwal, ‘ which is justly con-  “* sidered as the key-stone of the history of this country, and one which is consulted  ‘* and quoted by every student, whether young or old, whether noble or plebeian.”   All historians who have written the life of Misa agree in describing him as a man  of undaunted courage, and great abilities ; he was, they say, generous, mild, pious,",360,book_4,chapter_4

Al-hijéri says that ‘“ he  “ always surrounded his person with holy men, and virtuous friends, whom God  “ Almighty selected to be the instruments of his glory and power, as well as the  “‘ means of establishing the fame of Misa, a fame that shall last throughout day and  “night, and which the course of ages shall not impair; although it was tarnished in  “his days by his becoming the victim of that cruel enemy against whom a noble-  “minded man has no power, I mean envy and hatred, those two vices so common  “in people of narrow minds,—for nothing is more true than the words of that  “ captain who exclaimed—  : ‘ No captain ever stood against malevolence.’ ”   Al-hijari says that Misa was originally from Wada-l-kord, a town of Hejéz, that  he became a mauli of the Beni Merwan of Damascus, and that having gained some  celebrity by his military talents the Khalifs of that family appointed him to different  situations in the state, until, under the Khalifate of Al-walid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, he  was intrusted with the government of Africa proper, and more remote countries in  the West; that he penetrated to the utmost frontiers, and conquered Andalus,  entering it from the mountain called after him in the vicinity of Ceuta“! But  having been recalled to Syria by Al-walid, the indisposition and death of that Khalif  was the cause of all his misfortunes, since Suleyman, his brother and successor,  inflicted upon him a most severe chastisement, deprived him of his riches, and even  went so far as to send him to Wéda-l-kord, the place of his birth, in order that his  countrymen might harass and despise him. According to the same writer Musa  died at Wada-l-koré, in the year ninety-seven (beginning Sept. a. p. 715), as above  stated.   Tbnu Bashkiwal also mentions his death as having taken place at Wada-l-koré in  the said year, and adds, that his military science and talents for government were  sufficiently established by his conquests, as well as by the fact of his being  appointed in perilous times to the command of those Moslem settlements beyond  Egypt, and along the shores of the ocean between the country of the Berbers and  the country of Andalus ; and that, respecting his literary accomplishments, some of  his writings, in prose as well as in verse, were reckoned to be very good, and of  sufficient merit to class their author among those writers who have strung together  the pearls of speech. Ibnu Hayydn says that he was eloquent, and a master of  the Arabic language, and gives as a proof his conversation with Ibnu-l-mahlab, and  the answer he sent to the Khalif Al-walid.

The second, Al-mileki, is indicative of the sect followed by  the author, who, like most western Arabs, professed the doctrines of MA4lik Ibn Ans. The third is the  general appellative of all the Moslem inhabitants of Africa and Egypt; and the fourth—which in    two out of the three MSS. which I have consulted is pointed thus wp 3) (Al-isha’rt)—may be  I F    either that of a tribe, or that of a religious sect whose founder was Abit-l-hasan ‘Ali Ibn Isma’il  Al-ash’arf, who belonged to the same tribe (see D’Herbelot, Bib. Or. voce Aschariun). The tribe of  Isha’r, which, according to Kalkashandi (Ar. MS. in the Brit. Mus., 7353), may be written also Ash’ar    78    ~ } was a branch of the noble stock of the Benf Kahttdn, and settled early in Spain, for Ibnu-1-khattib,  in his history of Granada, entitled Kitdbu-l-ahdttah f( tdrtkhi Gharndttah (Ar. MS. in my possession),  mentions it among those that had their domicile in or about the city of Granada; and Casiri, in  his Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 262, gives the name of an illustrious Arab, a K&di-l-kod4 in that  city, whose name was Abi-l-hasan Mohammed Ibn Yahya Ibn Rabi’ Al-isha’ri.   I am, however, inclined to believe that the word Isha’rf or Ash’arf designates the sect, not the  family, of the author; my reasons for supposing so are—Ist. That it is not uncommon to find African  doctors professing the sect of M4lik, and following, besides, the religious opinions of Ash’ari: 2nd.  That one of the author’s ancestors used the patronymic Al-korayshi, denoting an origin with which  the tribe of Ash’ar is in no way connected. I shall conclude by observing that As-sam’4ni, in his  genealogical treatise entitled Kitdbu-l-ansdb (Ar. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 7352, fos. 12 and 40),  writes this patronymic thus, Al-ash’arf, and derives it from Ash’ar, which means ‘‘a man whose body  is covered with hair,” a surname which was given to the eldest son of Odad, the head of the tribe.   The patronymic Al-makkarf, which former writers (see Fluegel’s transl. of H4ji Khalfah, vol. ii. p. 115,  and Shakspear’s Hist. of the Moham. Emp. in Spain, p. 31,) have erroneously written Al-mokri and Al-  mukry (meaning a reader of the Koran in a Mosque), may be written either Al-makkar( or Al-makri, as the  author himself informs us in that part of the manuscript which I have left untranslated (Part 11. Book iii.  fo. 414). ‘ The patronymic surname of our family has been variously written by various authors, some,    “like Ibn Marzdk, writing it thus, us il Al-makrt, while others, and those the greater number, will",363,,

Ibn Marzik may be right, for, having written the life of one    “ of my ancestors under this title, os A anaall ee yi AP sy yp (the light of the moon    “on the declaration of the life of the faquikh Al-makrt,) he must have seriously investigated the  “« subject, and his opinion is therefore entitled to some credit; but we follow the majority,—in which  “‘may be counted authors of the greatest repute,—who always spell it thus, Al-makkarf. It is in  “either case a relative adjective derived from Makkarah (or Makrah, as others will have it),* a small  “ town in the country called Ifrikiyyah (Africa proper).”   In the same page the author acquaints us with some circumstances respecting his family. He tells  us that one of his ancestors had the honour of being the preceptor of the famous Wizir Lis4nu-d-din  Ibnu-l-khattib (whose life forms the subject of the present work), and that his grateful disciple  consecrated to him an article in his Biographical Dictionary, which he copies at length. Indeed,  looking into the biography of illustrious men who lived at Granada, written by Ibnu-l-khattib (Ar.  MS. in my possession), I find the following notice of him, which I have translated entirely, as it abounds  in curious information, and may serve to illustrate the writer’s narrative.   “One of the instructors of my youth, and to whom I am mostly indebted for whatever knowledge I  “ possess, is the Sheikh Abd ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibn Ab{ Bekr Ibn Yahya  « Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahm4n Ibn Abi Bekr Ibn ’Ali Al-koraysh{ At-telemsan{, Kddiu-l-jamd’h (or supreme judge)  “at Fez. The following notice of his ancestors I hold from him :—‘ The first of my family who fixed his  “ residence at Makkarah was the Sheikh ’Abdu-r-rahm4n Ibn Abi Bekr Ibn ’Ali Al-makkari, the disciple  “and companion of the famous Sheikh Abi Medin. ’Abdu-r-rahm4n was the father of five children,  “ and I, Mohammed, am the son of Mohammed, son of Ahmed, son of Abi Bekr, son of Yahya, son of  “the said ’Abdu-r-rahmén. From time immemorial my family had exercised the profession of commerce  “in the countries where they settled, deriving no small share of influence and riches from it. They  “ furrowed the sands of the desert in all directions, they dug wells, and facilitated travelling in the  “ Sahra, thus affording security to merchants and travellers; they took a drum, and marched always  “« preceded by a banner, and headed the numerous caravans which from time to time penetrated into the  “country of the blacks. Yahya, son of ’Abdu-r-rahman, being dead, his five sons, Abi Bekr, Mo-  « hammed, ’Abdu-r-rahman, ’Abdu-]-wahid, and ’Alj, determined upon forming a partnership, carrying on  “« the trade conjointly, and dividing between themselves the profits of their mercantile speculations. They  “accordingly threw together in a common fund all their father’s inheritance, and, having held a  “consultation together as to the means of carrying on the trade to the greatest advantage of the  “community, it was agreed that Abi Bekr and Mohammed, the two eldest, and the principal branches of  “ my genealogical tree on the male and female side, should remain and establish themselves at Telemsan ;  “that ’Abdu-r-rahmAn, the eldest of the three remaining brothers by another wife, should fix his resi-    ce    ‘  _} in the    «dence at Sijilmdsah ; and, lastly, that ’Abdu-l-wahid and ’Ali should go to Aywalétin® Ye I, GS         « It is evident that this difference in the spelling originated from the Berber name of the town. Masrah, in Berber,  means great, and Amukrdn means a great man, a chief. Al-bekri says that in the dialect spoken by the Masmidis Mokrah  ydkosh means “ God is great.” He, however, writes the name of this town Makrah, not Makkarah. See Ar. MS. in the  Brit. Mus., No. 9577, fo.47. M. Jaubert, in his French translation of Idrisi, Paris, 1836, vol. i. pp. 202, 241, reads Mokra,  as well as Hartmann, (see Edrisii Africa, Gotting. 1795, pp. 77, 117, 132, e¢ passim); M. de Quatremére has Makarrah.

It was done as agreed between them; each reached the place of his destination, settled there,  “ married, and had a family, and they began to conduct their trade in the following manner :—those in  “Telemsén sent to their partners in the desert such goods and commodities as were wanted in those  “ districts, while these supplied them in return with skins, ivory, and goroo nuts? x 55 9 In the meanwhile  “Abdu-r-rahm4n, the one stationed at Sijilmdsah, was like the tongue of the balance between the two,  “since, being placed at a convenient distance between Telems4n and the desert, he took care to acquaint  “the respective parties with the fluctuations of the trade, the amount of losses sustained by traders, the  “ overstock of the markets, or the great demand for certain articles ; and, in short, to inform them of the  "" secret designs of other merchants engaged in the same trade, as well as of the political events which  “ might in any way influence it. By these means they were enabled to carry on their speculations with  “ the greatest success, their wealth increased, and their importance waxed every day greater. However,    “ their establishment in the desert was once on the verge of ruin; the people of Tekrir ) is having  “ invaded the territory of Aywalatin, and taken possession of that city, the Arab residents were placed in  “great danger, and their property was on the point of passing into the hands of the conqueror, as  “ happened to that of the natives. But my ancestors, being men of great courage and determination,  “would not consent to witness their ruin,—they assembled all their servants and dependents, and such  “traders as happened to be in Aywalatin at the time, and, having distributed arms among them, they  “ shut themselves up in their warehouse and decided to fight, if necessary, for the defence of their goods  “and chattels. *Abdu-l-wahid then went to see the king of the Tekrir,° to petition him for the pre-  “ servation of their property, and acquaint him with their determination not to submit tamely to the  “ oppression, and to resist any attacks directed against them. The king received him with the greatest  “ affability and kindness ; he ordered him to be well lodged and hospitably entertained, and, his esteem  “and affection for him increasing, he distinguished him above the rest of the merchants residing in or  “trading with his country, giving him in conversation and in his letters the appellation of ‘sincerest  “ friend’ and ‘dearest relative.’ Not satisfied with these marks of friendship, the king of the Tekriir  “ often wrote to the partners of Telems4n, applying directly for such goods as he wanted for his own  “ consumption, or such as were most sought for in his dominions, and the language and expressions used in  “ his letters were equally flattering and significative of the greatest affection and esteem. This I can prove  “ by his letters, as well as by those of other sovereigns in Maghreb, which I now have in my possession.  “ The moment my ancestors perceived that they could trust and rely on kings, such difficulties as might  “have existed before were speedily removed; the countries through which they travelled appeared to  “them as if ornamented with the gayest colours, the desert and its dangers seemed no longer the scene  “of death and misery, and they began to frequent its most lonely and dangerous tracts; their wealth  “thereby increasing so rapidly that it almost surpassed the limits of computation. Nor were these the  “only advantages arising from their enterprise ; the nations with whom they traded were considerably  “benefited by it, for it must be understood that the trade with the desert was in the most deplorable  “state before the people of Makkarah? engaged in it; merchants totally unacquainted with the real  “wants of the inhabitants carried thither articles which were either of no use, or no value to them,  “ taking in exchange objects which were to them a source of profit and wealth. This even went so far         * Tekrir is sometimes written with the article, meaning no doubt the people or nation so called; at other times without,  and is then to be applied to the country inhabited by them.

He left behind him numerous proofs of his learning and talents; indeed, his  acquisitions in the sciences seem to have been almost universal, for in the list of works (forty-nine in  number, and some of them consisting of several volumes,) which Casiri has given (Bib. Arab. Hisp. Esc.  vol. ii, p. 72) there is scarcely any topic in the useful or elegant arts which he left untouched. History,  medicine, music, theology, astronomy, rhetoric, and poetry, alike exercised his prolific pen, and among  his works many may be pointed out which by’ their titles, or their apparent contents, make us  deeply regret their loss. As it is, the Library of the Escurial exhibits some which sufficiently prove his  vast learning ; his history of Granada, entitled % pail Bo o & yall Seco!!

Lib., No. 1771),—of both which works Casiri has given very full extracts in the second volume of  his Catalogue,—are more than sufficient to establish his reputation as a writer of history, a branch of  science for which he ‘possessed the highest qualifications. A biography of illustrious men born at  Granada (Arab. MSS. in the Esc. Lib., Nos. 1668 and 1669),—the itinerary of his travels through Spain  and Africa (Nos. 1750 and 1811),—a collection of his official letters to the sovereigns of Africa  (No. 1820),—and a short treatise on the plague which ravaged the city of Granada, a.H. seven hundred  and forty-nine (a.p. 1348-9), with prescriptions for those who might again be attacked (No. 1780),—are  among the literary productions of this eminent writer preserved in the Escurial Library.

' Thou Sa’id being an historian whom the author has consulted at large, I have thought it necessary to  give some account of his life and writings, borrowed from the same work I am now translating (Part 1.  Book vi. fo. 131, verso). His entire name was Abi-l-hasan ‘Ali Ibn Miisa Ibn Mohammed Ibn’ Abdi-  I-malik Tbn Sa’id. He was born at Granada, of illustrious parents, on the first day of Shawwal of  the year six hundred and ten (Feb. a.p. 1214). His ancestor, ’Abdu-]-mélik Ibn Sa’fd, distinguished  himself in the wars between the Almoravides and Almohades. Being governor of a certain castle called  rex S35 Kal’at Yahseb (now Alcalé la Real), he declared himself against the Almohades, and  contrived for some time to maintain his independence. At last, on the subjection of Spain by the  Beni ’Abdi-l-miimen, he was, like the other chieftains, obliged to acknowledge their sway, although,  as a reward for his ready submission, he was allowed to continue in the government of his castle.   Abi-l-hasan was educated at Seville, where he passed his early youth. He quitted his country for  the East, visited Cairo, Damascus, Mausal, and Baghdad, where he was in six hundred and forty-eight  (s.p. 1250-1); from thence he went to Basrah and performed his pilgrimage, which being done, he  returned to the West. He died in Ttinis in the year six hundred and eighty-five (a.p. 1286-7).  Among the many works which he wrote, especially biographical and historical, the principal are the    >  following: Ist. wz yb oe ke! Wo EMS GIS (the book of the sphere of literature, com-  prehending the whole language of ‘the Arabs), which he divided into two distinct and separate parts, viz.,    bp ws Ss (the shining like the rising sun on the beauties of the East). 2ndly, A history    of his family, with this title Dew AP es AP disul viel (the propitious constellation in the history  of the Bent Sa’id), and other historical and geographical works, from which Al-makkari made ample quo-  tations, and which will be duly noticed in the ensuing notes.   Tbnu Sa’id is often quoted by Abt-l-fedé, Makrizi, Ibnu Khaldiin, Ibn Khallekén, and other writers of  note who have treated on the history and geography of Africa. Casiri has given a short notice of him  (fo. 110. vol. ii. of his Bibl. Ar. Hisp. Esc). He agrees with our author in the year of his death, which  he places at Tiinis in six hundred and eighty-five, but he makes him a native of Kal’at Yahseb (Alcali),  instead of Granada, and says that he died at the age of eighty, when he was only seventy-five.  D'Herbelot, in his Bid. Or. voc. Tarikk, mentions an author called ’Ali Ibn Sa’id, who, he says, wrote  the Kitdbu-l-ghardyib (book of wonders).

Casiri mentions him often under the names of Ién Hatan and Abi Merwdn (vol. ii. pp. 30,  153), but gives no information whatever as to the time of his birth, that of his death, or his writings. I bor-  row from Ibnu Bashktwél, in the Kitdbu-s-silah (Arab. MS. in the Nat. Lib. Madrid, marked Gg. 29), the  following particulars :—‘‘ Abi Merw4n Hayy4n Ibn Khalf Ibn Huseyn Ibn Hayydn was born at Cordova in  “the year three hundred and ninety-seven (a.p. 1006-7). His ancestor, Hayyan, had been a mauli of  “*Abdu-r-rahmin I., King of Cordova. He was an eloquent, learned, and judicious writer; he composed  “ a history of Andalus under this title tal puss 3 sl wl (the book of the seeker of  “« information respecting the history of Andalus), in ten large volumes; besides that large historical work  “of his which every body admires, and which counts no less than sixty volumes, entitled ott  ab SI LS! 3 (the book of solid information on the history of Andalus). He also wrote poetry,    “and various theological tracts. Ibnu Hayyén died on a Sunday, three days before the end of Rabi’ 1.  “« of the year four hundred and sixty-nine (Oct. 30, a.p. 1076), and was buried the next day, after the  ‘‘ prayer of ’Assar, in the cemetery of the suburb. Al-ghos4n{ says that Ibnu Hayy4n was of the tribe  “ of Sadf; but authors are at’ variance on this particular.”   There is nothing in common, as De Sacy’s conjecture would lead us to suppose (see Chr. Ar. vol. i.  p. 408), between this Ibnu Hayy4n and another mentioned by Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 153),  who was a native of Ceuta, flourished in the fourth century of the Hijra, and wrote a history of the tdbi’s  or followers of the Prophet. Nor is there the least analogy, as D’Herbelot seems to indicate (Bib. Or.  voc. Abi Haian), between the Cordovan historian and the famous grammarian Athiru-d-din Mohammed,  surnamed Abd Hayy4n, who died in Cairo in seven hundred and forty-five of the Hijra (a.p. 1344-5).   Ibn Khallekén, in his biographical dictionary (Zyd. Ind. 209), gives the life of this historian in nearly  the same terms as Ibnu Bashkiwél. H4ji Khalfah also mentions him in his bibliographical index; sce  voc. Ttirtkh Ibn Hayydn and Térikh Andalus.",372,,
"    cuaP. 1.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 311    + Abu Zeyd ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Mohammed Ibn Khaldtin. De Sacy has alluded frequently to this  historian, and translated some of his writings. (See Chr. Ar. vols. i. and ii., and Relation de I Egypte,  p. 509-524). He was born in Tiinis, on the first day of the month of Ramadhan of the year seven  hundred and thirty-two of the Hijra (May 26, a.p. 1332), and died, according to Abii-l-muahfsen, on  the twenty-fifth day of Ramadhan of the year eight hundred and eight (March 15, a.p. 1406), at the  age of seventy-six (Arabian or lunar) years.   To the details already given by M. De Sacy (Chr. Arab. vol. i. p. 393) upon the life and the writings  of Tbnu Khaldiin, I may add the following interesting anecdote which Al-makkari relates in Part 1.  Book vi. ‘‘ While the K4di-l-kod&4 Abi Zeyd Ibn Khaldiin Al-hadhram{ was in the service of the  “ Sultan of Egypt, Farej Ibn Barkik, the conqueror Timur invaded Syria, defeated the Sultan’s army,  “and obliged him to retreat upon Cairo. Among the prisoners who fell that day into his hands were  “the Kadis of the four sects of Egypt, several distinguished theologians, and Ibnu Khaldtn himself.  “« When the prisoners were about to be introduced to the conqueror’s tent, Abu Zeyd said to them, ‘ Let  me speak for you all, and perhaps I may save you, if God be pleased; if my speech produce no effect,  ‘* each of you may then speak for himself.’ They all agreed that he should be their spokesman. Abii  Zeyd, who had on a dress in the western fashion, was then introduced to the presence of Timtr-lenk,  who, seeing him thus arrayed, said to him, ‘Art thou not a native of this country?’ Upon which,  Tbnu Khaldiin told him how he was a native of the West, and that his name was so and so, and that  he had come to the East for the purpose of performing pilgrimage, &c. Timtr-lenk then began to  converse with him, Abii Zeyd answering him in his own language (Maghrebi), mixing, now and then,  injurious expressions ;* and it was an evident miracle of the Almighty that the trick was not discovered.  “« After this, Abii Zeyd said to Timur-lenk, ‘I have composed a history of the world, and am thinking  “* of ornamenting it with thy name.’ Others say that it was Timur who said to him, ‘I am told that  thou hast written a history of the world; what sayest thou of mentioning me in it, as thou hast done  “‘ Bokht-Nasser, for both of us conquered the world.’ To which Abi Zeyd Ibn Khaldtin replied, ‘Thy  ‘* exploits, and those of Bokht-Nasser, are undoubtedly worthy of the attention of the historian.’ This  * answer pleased Timur-lenk, who not only spared Abd Zeyd, but admitted him to his privacy. Some  time after this interview, they say that Abii Zeyd entered the presence of Timur-lenk and said to him, ‘O  master! if there is any thing in my present condition to give me sorrow it is my having left in Cairo  * an historical work which I have written, and in the composition of which I have spent the best ycars  * of my life. Were I to die now, the light which I intended should be thrown upon thy actions and  ‘ administration would be lost to mankind, for I am sure there is nobody in thy service who has  “ laboured so assiduously to that end; if, on the contrary, thou allow me to go in search of it, I shall be  ‘‘ back immediately to spend the remainder of my life in thy service,’ or words to that effect. Timur  “ then granted him permission, but Ibnu Khaldiin returned not as he had promised to do.”    Tonu Khaldiin used the patronymics of [shbflt ost and Al-hadhramié nee! The first, De Sacy    (see ib.) thought, indicated that he was either a native or a resident of Seville, but that city having been  taken by the Christians in the year six hundred and twenty-six of the Hijra, that is, nearly a century  before Ibnu Khaldin’s birth, this could not be the case. His family, indeed, was orignally from Seville,  for I find in the biographical dictionary of Arabian physicians, by Ibn Abi Ossaybi'ah, (Ar. MS. in the  Brit. Mus., No. 7340, fol. 135,) that there was in that city, in the fifth century of the Hijra, an individual         + I suppose using words with a double meaning, which, to an illiterate conqueror like Timur, must have been unintelligible,  especially as the dialect spoken by the western Arabs differed materially from that of Syria.",373,,
"    312 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [BOOK I.    named Abti Moslem ’Omar Ibn Ahmed Ibn Khaldtin; and Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. i. p. 20, and  vol. ii. p. 72) mentions individuals bearing the family name of Khaldin. As early as the year two  hundred and ninety-eight of the Hijra, a certain Karfbah Ibn ’Othmén Ibn Khaldiin, who was one of the  principal citizens of that city, was put to death with two of his brothers for having revolted in Seville  against ""Abdullah, Sultén of Cordova. See Casiri (loco Jaudato, vol. ii. p. 35), and Conde, Hist. de la  Dom. vol. i. p. 337.   As to the second patronymic, Al-hadkramt, it was natural to suppose, as De Sacy did, that the family of  Khalddn drew their origin from Hadhra-maut, a city in Syria. But such is not the case, for I read in  Ibnu-l-abbér (Ar. MS. in the Nat. Lib. Mad., Gg. 12) that the patronymic Al-hadhramf, so common  among Spanish Arabs, especially among those domiciliated at Seville, was given to the descendants  of Hadhra-maut, whom some genealogists make the son of Kahttén, and others the son of Kays, son of  Mu’awiyah, son of Josham, son of ’Abdu-sh-shems, son of Al-ghauth, &c., all sprung from Himyar.    7    0 ial Andalosh, with a slight aspiration on the initial a, is a corruption for Vandalocii, as we find  the Vandals were called. The Arabs could not well represent the sound of the V otherwise than by    using a hamzah }.    § The passage here quoted is to be found in the introduction to the history of Granada by Mohammed  Ibnu-]-khattfb, better known by the honorific surname of Lis4nu-d-din, an account of whom has been  given at p. 307, note 11.    7 Abu 'Obeyd-illah Al-bekri. The greatest obscurity has hitherto prevailed respecting the age and the  writings of this famous geographer. Even his names and surnames were but imperfectly known; for,  although the works of Al-bekri are repeatedly quoted by Arabian writers, and especially by those who  have treated on the geography of Africa and Spain, he always appears designated by his patronymic,  Al-bekri. Ibnu Khaldiin, who mentions him often, (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9575, fol. 92, et  passim,) always calls him Al-bekrf; Tbnu Bashkiiwél (Arab. MS. in the Nat. Lib. Mad., Gg. 29),  ’ Obeyd-illah Al-bekrt; and Ibnu-1-khattib, in his history of Granada, (Arab. MS, in my possession, fol. 50,)  ’Obeyd Al-bekri simply. Ibn Khallekaén does not mention him. Haji Khalfah (voc. Mesdlek) gives only  the year of his death. Even M. De Quatremére, who, with his usual criticism and learning, has lately  published a translation of part of Al-bekri’s geographical work (see Not. et Ext. des MSS. de la Bibl.  du Roy, vol. xii.), could obtain no satisfactory account of his life and writings.   Having from continual reference learnt to appreciate the merits of Al-bekri’s geographical work, which  in most instances was literally copied by Idrisf, I was led to investigate the matter closely, to gain, if  possible, some information upon the age in which that eminent writer lived, and the works which he left.  I perused in vain several MSS. in the Nat. Lib. Mad., containing the lives of illustrious men and authors  born in Spain, and I had almost given up my laborious undertaking, when, to my great satisfaction, I  found by chance in the Bégh’yatu-l-multamisi f( tdrtkhi rejdli ahli-l-andalusi (the object of the wishes for  those who desire information on the history of the illustrious Andalusians), by Adh-dhobi (Arab.

To his attainments in geography and history Al-bekri seems to have united those of medicine and  natural history, for I find him repeatedly quoted in the writings of Ibnu-]-beyttar and other naturaliste,  as well as by Ibn Ab{ Ossaybi’ah, who, in his lives of Arabian physicians, (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus.,  No. 7340, fol. 147,) says that he was an excellent physician, well acquainted with the properties of  plants, and that he wrote a work entitled uJ 3) Gob ee“) Gobill ylel Quis (a treatise on  the principal plants and shrubs growing in Andalus).   I ought to add that the author of the gle! gpulee AP ybasll wis Kaldyidu-l’ikiyén fi    mahdseni-l-a’ydn, ‘ gold necklaces on the brilliant actions of the illustrious,’ (a biographical dictionary of  Spanish poets in my possession,) gives also a short notice of Al-bekri, whom he says he knew at Seville  when young. He was born in four hundred and thirty-two (a.p. 1040-1), and died, as stated above, in four  hundred and eighty-seven (a.p. 1094-5). Al-bekri is often mentioned by Conde in his Hist. de la Dom.    (vol. i. pp. 395, 404), but that writer appears not to have seized the meaning of the patronymic “s pe    Al-bekri, which he translates by De Bejer, thus making Abt ’Obeyd-illah a native of Bejer, a town of  Estremadura, instead of a member of the tribe of Bekr. See loco Jaudato, vol. ii. p. 77.   The principal among Al-bekri’s works is his Kitdbu-l-mesdlek wa-l-memdlek, divided into three parts. 1  have already stated in the Preface that I possessed an ancient copy of the first part. The second is in the  British Museum, marked 9577. It wants some leaves at the beginning and at the end, and is described in  the Catalogue of Additions for 1833 as containing the history of the conquest of Egypt by the Moslems,  and as being the work of Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakam Al-misri; but I need not remark  that the fact of the volume beginning with an account of the conquest of Misr by the Moslems, borrowed  from the above-mentioned writer, whose name appears written in large letters on the beginning of the  page, is the only circumstance which could have given rise to that mistake.   As it is, the copy in the British Museum is not only ancient but appears more correct than another  of the same volume in the Royal Library at Paris, which M. De Quatremére used for his translation. It  is in every respect a valuable manuscript, and I have made ample use of it in writing the present notes.  There is also in the Escurial Library a copy of the second part.    8 j) ps Al-ahw&z is the name of a city and district of Khuzistén, one of the provinces of Persia.  It is sometimes applied to the whole country. Idrisi (p. 381 of the French translation) says that the  inhabitants of that country are very much annoyed by a sort of scorpion called 3 ,) iF al-jarrdrah, of a  yellowish hue, and whose bite produces immediate death. Ibnu-l-wardi, in his Khartdatu-l-’ajdyib  (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9590, fol. 113, verso), in the chapter treating on the peculiarities of  each country, confirms the statement. But, a few lines lower down, Al-makkari quotes the words of  another geographer who praises Spain for having few venomous reptiles. Contradictions like this are  unavoidable, owing to the plan adopted by the author.    ® Aba ’A'mir go duull As-salémi, Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 40) mentions an author  VOL.

According to Al-homayd{, quoted by Casiri, (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Ese. vol. ii. p. 329,)  Ar-r4zi wrote a very copious history of Spain, and a topographical description of Cordova, similar  to that of Baghdéd composed by Ahmed Ibn Abi Téhir.   The same author, Al-homaydi, (Arab. MS. in the Bodl. Lib. Oxford, Hunt. 464,) says that he saw a  genealogical history of the illustrious Arab families established in Spain, which was attributed to an  author named also Ahmed Ibn Mohammed Ibn Misa, although he was unable to say if he was the  same as Ar-r4zi. ‘   Of his life scarcely any account has been obtained. Al-makkari, in the sixth book (fo. 215, verso),  treating on those illustrious Moslems who came from the East to settle in Spain, gives the life of the  father of this Ar-rézi in the following terms :—‘‘ Mohammed Ibn Misa Ibn pty Busheyr Ibn Oa  “ Jenéd Ibn Lekitt Al-kenéni, surnamed Ar-rézi, owing to his being a native of Ray, a province of Persia,  “‘was the father of the famous historian Ahmed Ar-r&zi. He arrived in Spain from the East, as a  “* merchant, but being at the same time a man of learning and ability he met with encouragement from  “the Sultans of the family of Merw4n, who then occupied the throne of Andalus, and he consequently  “« settled in Cordova, where he died on his return from an embassy to the city of Elvira, whither he had  “been sent with a message for the Amir Al-mundhir Ibn Mohammed. His death took place in the  ‘month of Rabi’-l-akhar, a.#. two hundred and seventy-three (Oct. a.p. 886), according to Ibnu  “ Hayy4n in his Muktabis, from whom the preceding account is borrowed.”   As to Ar-rézi himself, he appears to have flourished during the reign of ‘Abdu-r-rahm4n III, that is  to say, towards the end of the fourth century of the Hijra and the beginning of the fifth. Ibnu-l-abbar    (Arab. MS. in the Nat. Lib. Mad., Gg. 12) calls him Kl At-térikhi, that is, the historian    par excellence, and says that, among other works on the topography and history of Spain, he wrote  a very voluminous one in which he described, with the greatest detail, the routes, sea-ports, and prin-  cipal cities, as well as the various settlements formed by the Arabs of the six invading armies olin 3!  (al-qjndd) in its provinces ; the peculiarities of each of them, the productions of the soil, mineral riches, in-  dustry, commerce, &c. This is no doubt the work to which Al-makkart frequently alludes, and from which  he makes numerous quotations ; and, to judge by the time in which Ar-rézi wrote, and the interesting  details he gives, it is really a matter of great regret that this or some other work of this eminent historian  should not be preserved entire in any of the public libraries of Europe. Casiri, indeed, with great  boldness, in my opinion, attributed to this writer a precious historical fragment existing in the Library  of the Escurial, which he translated at the end of the second volume of his Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. ;  but, as he was unassisted in his conjecture by any further proof than the name of Ahmed, (so common  among Mohammedans,) which is also the initial name of Ar-r4zi, having been placed at the head of the  page, very little reliance can be placed on a statement resting upon so loose a foundation. Neither can  much faith be placed in a semi-barbarous translation, bearing the title of Historia del Moro Razis, and  which, notwithstanding Casiri’s and Conde’s opinions to the contrary, is undoubtedly a version from the  writings of that Arabian historian, as I shall hereafter prove by a comparison of the translation with the  original text.    ‘| Tt is by no means easy to determine what part of Spain this word pl Ath-thagher is here meant to",376,,
"    CHAP. 1.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 315    designate. Its real and primitive signification is a pass in the mountains, or a district contiguous to the  enemy’s territory, a line of frontier. In this sense it is often used by Al-makin; Abd-l-fedé, and other  Eastern authors. In Spain it was given to those countries bordering on the Christian territory,  but, as the limits of the Cordovan empire often changed in the course of a successful invasion, the  word Thagher can only have conveyed a loose and indefinite idea; for instance, during the greatest  splendour of the Khalifate, the frontiers of the Mohammedan empire were extended on one side as  far as Navarre, on the other into the very heart of the kingdom of Leon. The former were designated    under the name of set pi ‘upper frontiers,’ and the latter under that of sol pi « lower  Frontiers.’ In later times, when the Mohammedan power began to decline, and the Christians    poured on all sides upon its defenceless provinces, Aragon was known under the former denomination,  and Toledo and its district under the second. The former of these two countries having, by the natural  strength of the soil, proved a more effectual barrier against the attacks of the Christians, and having  remained longer attached to the Moslem state, retained the name of Thagher long after it had ceased  to make part of the Moslem dominions, for Ibnu-l-khattib, in his Kitdbu-l-ahdttati (Arab. MS. in my    possession), calls James II., King of Aragon, - weole Urle Jaymes sdhibu-th-thagher ; and,    long after the reduction of Granada, the Moriscos inhabiting the towns and villages of Aragon were  called by the Spaniards Moros Tagarinos, i. e. from the Thagher.   It will not perhaps be amiss to observe that the Zegris, those knights of romance, who, by their deadly  feuds with the Beni Serréj (Abencerrages), hastened the fall of Granada and the ruin of their country,  were neither more nor less than certain powerful families who, after the taking of Saragossa and other  cities in Aragon (Thagher), sought refuge in other Mohammedan states and settled for the most part in  Granada, where they were known by the patronymic of Theghriiin (Zegris).   The spot here designated by the author might be Aragon, a province of Spain in which, owing to its  northern position, all fruits of the earth are considered to be more backward.    ""2 The following description of Andalus, by Ar-rézi, occurs at the bottom of the same page. As it is  expressed in nearly the same words, I have suppressed it in the body of the work, to avoid repetition.  “ Andalus,” he says, “is situate at the extremity of the fourth climate, one of the seven into which the  “ whole of our inhabited globe has been divided by geographers. Thus placed in the midst of the earth,  “ Andalus has delightful valleys and excellent lands, which many large rivers irrigate and fertilize ;  “there are but few wild beasts and venomous reptiles; the temperature is excessively mild, and the  “seasons so temperate that the transition from one to another is almost imperceptible, and man has  “ not to dread there, as in other countries, the passage from summer to winter, and vice versa.”    at  E ers ) Arghén or Aragon. I have looked ip vain in Idrisi for the passage here attributed to him.  The substance may be the same, but the words are not. At the time when that distinguished geographer  wrote his description of Spain (the twelfth century of our era), Aragon, being almost entirely in the  hands of the Moslems, was still called Thagher, its present denomination being comparatively modern.  The MS. reads Bley loge us sl wx) db that is, ‘the country of Aragon, at the southern    extremity of which is situated the city of Barcelona,’ as I have translated; but this is undoubtedly an  error, for whatever limits are assigned to the kingdom of Aragon, Barcelona could never occupy a  southern position with regard to it.

Others say that a king named Pyrrhus cut roads through them, after which the mountains were  called by his name.

It is written  thus FN Oe Jebal Al-aghar in A.; my copy reads pi Al-@z; B. - Al-aghaz; but I have not    hesitated in following the former reading, or more correctly je Una Jebal Al-ghdr, which means ‘the    mountain of the cave,’ now Cape Trafalgar (Taraf-al-ghdr) from Taraf, a mountain, or promontory, and  ghdr, a cave.    38 The town here mentioned is Santa Maria Bent Razin, so called from Abti Merw4n ’Abdu-]-mélik  Ibn Razin, its founder. There was in Portugal another town called also Santa Maria, to which the  Arabs added the epithet al-gharbf (that is, of the West), that it might be distinguished from this,  which is in the eastern part of Spain, on the very same spot now occupied by the town of Albarracin,  a corruption of Aben-razin.    39 eS plo -= is, perhaps, the Tyrrhenum Mare, or Sea of Tuscany, of the ancients, although, by the  description given by the author, the Mediterranean seems intended.

Escur. vol. ii. p. 829, et seg.) and Conde (Hist.  de la Dominacion, vol. i. Prol. p. ix.) have imagined, a complete forgery—a confused mass of traditional  stories current among Christians and Moslems—not only was a real version from a work written by  Ar-réz{, but, as far as I can judge, as faithfully executed as most of those made during the middle ages  from Arabic writings. There are no doubt in it several passages, such as the chronology of the Gothic  kings, which must be interpolations made by the translators, or by subsequent copyists, but the  geographical description of Spain, and the account of its conquest by the Arabs, are given in a manner  which leaves no doubt as to their authenticity. The attentive perusal of a very ancient copy (perhaps  the original), which is kept in the library of the Cathedral of Toledo, had long ago made me suspect that  the judgment hazarded by the two above-mentioned authors, and in which they seemed supported by  the opinions of the best European critics, was rather hasty. However, not having the means of verifying  my conjecture, I was obliged to postpone my judgment until I should be enabled to collate the words  of Ar-réz{ with those of his translators. I will now transcribe from my own copy, made by me from  the MS. of Toledo, the oldest in all Spain, the passage on the territorial division of the country, in order  that my readers may judge if what I have advanced is correct or not.   «* Las Espafias son dos porque se parten por los movimientos de los aires, los giros de las nubes, e por  “ el corrimiento de los rios que van 4 una mar 6 4 otra. Eay Espana de Levante, e Espana de Poniente.  “‘ E Espana de Poniente es aquella que yace contra Oriente, e corren sus rrios contra la mar grande que  “ cerca todo el mundo e lluebe ay con vientos de Poniente, e comiengase en la sierra del collado 6 Tajada  “* que nace contra Septentrion yendo para Cantabria, e subiendo al termino de Astorga ayuntasse con la  “ tierra de Biscaya, e decende para Agrite que es a par de Toledo, e biene por Algarcir e es a par del mar  “menudo que viene en derecho de Carthagena, e va a par de la billa de Lorca.

The expressions Mar de  Zocac, meaning the Bahru-z-zokdk or Strait of Gibraltar; Mar de Xem, meaning Bahru-sh-shdm (i.e.  Sea of Syria or Mediterranean); and Mar de Ciran, for Bahr Tirren, are very remarkable, and prove  sufficiently of themselves the truth of the version.    a pat! wy (the son of the stringer of pearls?)

Al-jauf, and not Al-jif, as in the translation. The Arabian geographers make use of this  word to designate generally the north-west, sometimes the north. It is always that point of the  compass opposed to the Aiblak, and as this varies according to the geographical position of the countries  with respect to the Ka’bah, (square house at Mekka,) so does the jauf. The word kib/ah, in its origin,  meant that part of a mosque which faces the Ka’bah, and as this, in most Mohammedan countries of Asia,  was to the south, the word kiblah was used as a synonymous expression for south. The same might be said  of the word jauf, which means concavity, interior, darkness ; and hence the body of a mosque, or all that  part which is not the Aiblak, and is opposed to it. Kiblah, therefore, meaning the south, the word jauf  was employed to designate the north, or that part facing the south. But as the Aiblah of Mohammedan  temples, both in Spain and in Africa, was considerably inclined towards the south-east, in which sense the  word kiblah is frequently used by Western geographers, so will the word jauf be also found occasionally  used to designate the north-west. The Arabian geographers and historians of Spain are careful enough in  making this distinction; they call Galicia, Asturias, and Biscay, 5 Fe as) Akttdru-l-jauf (the north-  western districts), while they designate Aragon and Catalonia by (L.A) ot) Belddu-sh-shamdl (the  country of the north); and Al-bekri, in his geographical description of Africa, often uses the word in  such a way as not to leave any doubt as to its real meaning. The same might be said of Ibnu Khaldin  (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9575, fo. 97, et passim).    4 This dissipates all doubts concerning the etymology of the word ‘ Andalus,’ by which all Moham-  medan writers designate Spain. Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 827, et seg.) laboured hard to  show that the word Andalus was of Arabic, not of Latin, origin, by pretending that it was derived from  (Us die Handalis, a word meaning “‘a land of darkness,—regio vespertina et tenebrosa atque Occidentis  « finis.” But the nature even of the word ought to have shown the learned author that it was of foreign  importation and not Arabic.   The Arabs, more than any other nation, corrupted proper names by accommodating them to the genius  of their language; whenever a letter was of difficult pronunciation they suppressed it, especially if com-  mencing the word. The V of Vandalocii was therefore omitted, as well as the last two letters, which  made the word too long; they being averse to words of many syllables. I may allege, besides, as a  proof that the word Andalus is only a corruption from Vandalucia, that it is not uncommon to find in  Spanish MSS., even of the fifteenth century, the words Vandalocia and Vandalicia employed to designate  that portion of Spain which was still in the hands of the Moors. Andrés Bernaldez, who flourished  towards the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century, and who wrote a chronicle of  Ferdinand and Isabella, still inedited (Bib. Eg. in Brit. Mus., No. 306, fol. 784), says, ‘“ Y el adelantado  “* de Vandalucia con gran caballeria salto d recibir 2 los Reyes a la peiia de los enamorados,” (and the com-  mander of the frontier troops of Vandalucia went out to meet the king and queen as far as the  Lover’s rock.) .   I must observe that the word Andalus will always be used in this translation, per synecdochen, for the  whole Peninsula, or at least for that part of it which obeyed the rule of Islém, whatever may be its  dimensions.    * An account of this drought, which, according to Pedro de Medina (Libro de las Grandezas de Espoia,    eS    ",384,,

In the Chronicle of Spain written by Florian de Ocampo, (Medina del Campo, 1553, f. 114,) Bokht-  Nasr (or Nebuchodonosor) is represented, not indeed as the friend, but as the sworn enemy, of Spain,  which he invaded and wasted, owing to certain reinforcements which the Spaniards had sent to the  people of Tyre when that city was besieged by him. In the long list of fabulous kings which disfigures  the best-written histories of the Peninsula, there are two whose names might easily be transformed into  wy with the alteration of one point; one is called Teron,-who is said to have expelled the Almajuzcs  from Spain ; the other Tarraco, an Ethiopian warrior, who conquered Spain, and became also in time  King of Egypt. (See Florian de Ocampo, loco laudato, fol. ci. et seg.) The word Majis (from payos)  means a fire-worshipper and an idolater. It was in time applied by the Arabs to all northern nations.  The people here mentioned appear to be the same whom the Cronica de Alfonso el Sabio, top x., and the  Cror. Gen. pp. 78, 80, et pass., call Almajuzes, Almozudes, and Almonides. .   bed Usa WLS Kitdbu-l-muktabis, ‘the book of the seeker of information’ or ‘the book of the  fire-striking steel,’—for the word Al-muktabis is susceptible of both mcanings,—is the title of one of  the historical works written by Ibnu Hayy4n, which is said to have been composed of ten volumes.  See a preceding note (No. 3, p. 310).    © Al-khadher or Al-khidhr is a prophet whom some authors identify with Elias, while others suppose  him to be the same as St. George. He is reported to have drunk of the fountain of life, and to have  thereby become immortal. The Arabs think that he is still living, and that he will live until the day of  judgment. According to others, Al-khidhr was a holy man who held the office of Wizir to Ishkander  Dhi-l-karneyn. There is in the Library of the British Museum (No. 7366) a history of Alexander and  his Wizir Al-khidhr, written by Ibrahim Ibn Mufarraj As-sdri (of Tyre).   It is singular enough that a legend similar to that here related should have been preserved in some of  the ancient Spanish Chronicles,—not, indeed, as applied to a fabulous monarch, as Ishbaén or Hispan  undoubtedly was, but to one of the last Gothic kings. It is said in the Cronica General, fol. lxvii., that  after the death of Receswind, St. Leo, in compliance with the earnest wishes of the Goths, prayed  that they might be divinely directed in the choice of a sovereign, which they were about te make,  and that the Saint, being inspired by heaven, advised them to look in the West for a labourer named",385,,

On the other hand, the author can hardly mean Athaulphus, who was the first, for I defy the most  expert etymologist to show a combination by which that word could pass into Aténguints; besides, only  a few lines higher he is called Talubush. The series of Gothic kings is said in one place to have been  twenty-seven, in another thirty-six, and further down fifty-five, no doubt comprising the Suevic and  Vandalic monarchs. Contradictions similar to these abound throughout this work, owing to the circum-  stances I have explained in the Preface. They are still more glaring when relating to the ancient history  of the Peninsula, a subject with which the Arabs must necessarily have been but slightly acquainted.  However, Ibnu Hayy&n’s account is not far from truth,—Ataulphus was elected king in four hundred  and eleven; he entered Spain in four hundred and fourteen; the number of Gothic kings was thirty-six,  including Theodomir and Athanagild, and the duration of their empire three hundred and forty-two  years likewise.

It is likely, however, that the author meant neither the one nor the other, but Claudius  Constantinus, who was proclaimed emperor in a.p. four hundred and seven, and held part of the  Roman empire conjointly with Honorius, under whose reign Ataulphus crossed the Pyrenees and  established himself in Spain, in four hundred and twelve. But Claudius having been beheaded in four  hundred and eleven, the duration of his reign was only four years; and therefore this event could not  have taken place in the fifth year of his empire. Besides, the author, who has evidently mistaken here  the era of Czsar for that of Christ, ought to have said four hundred and forty-five of the era of  Safar.    % The word po Safar, which in Arabic means bronze, or copper, (whence the Spanish word Azofar,)  seems to be the translation of the Latin ra. There has been much dispute about the origin and  meaning of the word ra or Era. St. Isidore, in his Origines, thinks that it arose from a certain  tribute imposed by Augustus, and which was called ra, that is, ‘copper money ;’ Sepulveda is of  opinion that the word Afra is a corruption of Annus erat Augusti; Resende that it came from Ab erordio  regni Augusti, the initial letters of which compose the word Aira; Morales, Covarrubias, and Gibbon,  follow a similar opinion ; but the former is undoubtedly the true one. How singular that we should have  to learn from the Arabs the meaning and the etymology of a Latin word !   However, the 4ira is a date peculiar to Spain; it began thirty-eight years before the birth of Christ,  under the empire of Octavius, and from it the Spanish writers computed until the middle of the fourteenth  century, when it was superseded by the Christian.    * Roderic, or rather Ludherik, as the Arabs have it, by the change which occurs frequently of R into  L, ascended the throne in a.p. seven hundred and nine; the battle of Guadalete, in which he is supposed  to have lost his life, was fought in seven hundred and eleven. If we add the thirty-eight years of the  era of Cesar, this makes exactly the date here given by the author.    % T have looked m vain, in the portion of Ibnu Khaldin’s work which is preserved in the Library of the  British Museum, No. 9575, for the passage here alluded to by the author. It is an important one, as  there is nothing in it which is not to be perfectly reconciled with true history.    * The Gothic monarchs had no fixed place of residence; some residing in Toledo, others in Merida,  Barcelona, Cordova, &c.,—some even, like Liuva I., in five hundred and sixty-seven, having fixed their  court at Narbonne, the capital of Septimania.    © The same mistake was committed by Ibnu Hayy4n, Ibnu Bashkiwél, and other Spanish historians,  who, thinking Roderic to be the title of the Gothic sovereigns, not the name of one of them, often    designate by that name all the kings of Asturias. As to p> Jerjiz, it seems to be a corruption for  Georgius, who might, for aught I know, have been the Greek governor of Sicily at the time of its conquest  by the Arabs; but I think it more probable that it is meant for pee Jeregori or Gregorius, a Greek,  who, according to Ibnu Khaldin (Ar.

See also Retrospect of Mohammedan History, by Major David Price,  vol. i. p. 157, and Isidori Pacensis Chronicon, apud Florez, Esp. Sag. vol. viii., under Zra pexc. As  Sicily was a dependency of Africa, Gregorius is probably meant.    61 The Mohammedans believe that there are seven worlds, as well as seven heavens, and that the world  we inhabit occupies the top, so that by digging deeply one may discover the crests of the mountains of  that which is underneath us.    6 The word I have translated by wharf is avo y rass(f, which means a paved road, a mole built of  masonry, and corresponds exactly in all its meanings with the Spanish arrecife, derived from it. It is  generally used by the Eastern Arabs to designate a Roman causeway. See Lord Lindsay’s Letters on  Egypt.    63 By the two islands the author no doubt intends Algesiras and Tarifa, which were thus called by the  Arabs, owing either to one small island, which each of those cities has at the entrance of its port, or to  their peninsular shape, for the Arabs made no distinction between an island and a peninsula. The same  expression is used by Idrisi. See the translation by Jaubert, vol. i. p. 5.    64 All this account of Alexander’s visit to Spain, and the works he raised there, is to be met with in  almost every Arabian geographer who lived after Idrisi; but, as far as I am aware, in none who preceded  him. Neither Ibn Khordédbah, (Bodl. Lib., No. 963,) nor Ibn Haukal, (idid., No. 993,) nor Al-belaédhori,  (Brit. Mus., No. 7496,) nor the famous historian Mes’tidi, who collected with the greatest care all  the popular traditions current among the inhabitants of the subdued nations, mentions a word of it. I  am inclined to believe that this fable, like many others of the same stamp, had its origin among the  Christian inhabitants of Spain, for in the history which Alfonso el Sabio ordered to be compiled in the  thirteenth century, and which was printed for the first time at Zamora in the year one thousand five  hundred and forty-one, as well as in the Cronica General de Espanta, by Florian de Ocampo, (Medina ‘del  Campo, 1553, vol. i. p. 191,) it is said that the Spaniards sent an embassy to Alexander, offering him the  sovereignty of the land, and begging him to deliver them from the attacks of the Africans. See also  Mariana, Hist. Gen. book i. chap. v., and Morales, both of whom borrowed it from Paulus Orosius.

(See fo. 225, verso, and following in 7334, fo. 69, and  following in 9592, and 147, verso, in 9591.) In collating the various extracts introduced by the author in  the first book, as making part of Ash-shakandi’s risd/eh, with the treatise in its entire state in the  seventh, 1 found that all the historical and geographical information which the said production contains  had been embodied by Al-makkarf in that part of his work of which the present is a translation. This  makes it unnecessary for me to translate the whole risdleh, which,—besides being very long, and being  strewn with difficulties of no ordinary nature,—contains, as is the custom among Arabian writers, many  poetical extracts and much uninteresting detail, which would annoy rather than instruct those who look  for information respecting the history of Mohammedan Spain.   I ought to add that Al-makkarf (Part 1. Book vi. fo. 99) quotes a biographical work by Ash-  shakandi, entitled 3 pall WwUS (the book of the extremities ?), of which I find no mention whatever in  Haji Khalfah. °    ENS sic jy I ae ure y sl, ure 15! after which B. adds GUS 5 sb po aber J,  NLA! ‘and since those who lose their way in those (perilous) tracts cannot well be charged with  error’ (owing to the difficulty of the subject they treated).",390,,

According to the Nozhatu-l-albdb (Arab. MS. on Genealogy in the Brit. Mus.,  No. 7351, fo. 9), Al-barrédh is the surname of two Arabs who lived before Mohammed: one called  Al-hareth Ibn Davis Al-ay4di, the other Rafi’ Ibn Kays Ibn Rafi’. But in consulting the Thamaru-I-koliib,  by Ath-tha’alebi (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9598, fo. 21), I find not only the right name  of this individual, (which is there written Al-barrédh, with a teskdid upon the ra,) but likewise  a curious account of the origin of the expression elegantly used by Ash-shakandi. I here translate    the passage : lz 4633 Fatakatu-l-barrddh (an attack like that of Al-barrédh). The origin of this  proverbial expression is as follows: ‘ Al-barr&édh, son of Kays Al-kendn{, (of the tribe of Ken&nah,)  “was one of the Arabian warriors whose prowess and courage have become proverbial; such as  “ Al-héreth Ibn ps Dhélim, ’Amri Ibn prs Kolshim, Al-hojéf Ibn Hakim, &c. One of the    “« greatest exploits recounted of this Al-barradh is the following:—He was a man very unsettled in  “his habits, and extremely fond of adventure: having at various times committed infractions against  the laws of his tribe, they decided to get rid of him, and he was accordingly cast away and deprived  “of all his rights as an individual of it. After this Al-barrédh went to Mekka, and placed himself  under the protection of Harb Ibn Umeyyah, to whom he swore fidelity; but after staying for some  ‘time at Mekka, he became tired of his new residence, so that, leaving Hejjéz, he travelled to ""Irak,  ands arrived at the court of An-no’mén, son of Al-mundhir, where he fixed his residence.   “It was the custom of An-no’man to send every year to the fair of ’Ok4dh some loads of drugs and  silken stuffs, to be sold there on his account. When the time for the expedition arrived, as An-no’mén  was one day sitting in his council hall, thinking whom he would send forward with his goods, his eyes  “chanced to rest upon Al-barrédh and another man called ’Orwah Ibn Ghanimah Ar-rahhél, who  happened to be present at the time. ‘To whom,’ said An-no’mén, ‘shall I intrust my merchandize  “this year, that he may take it to ’Ok4dh and dispose of it at the fair?’ and Al-barradh replied, ‘ May  “ thy words be blessed! I am the proper man to take thy goods to the tribe of Kenénah, for I am  “‘ authorized by them to that effect.’ ‘ Yes,’ replied An-no’man, ‘ but what I want is a person who can  “take them not only to Hirah of Ken&nah, but to Hirah of Kays also.’ Hearing which, Orwah Ar-  “ rahh4l rose and said, ‘ May thy words be blessed! How dares this vagabond, this outcast from his  “‘ tribe, offer himself to convey the king’s merchandize? I am the fit man, since I am authorized to sell    “« goods among the inhabitants of e* Sheih and pros Kaysstim from Nejd and Tehémeh.’ ‘Thine are  “‘the goods,’ exclaimed An-no’mén. Upon which 'Orwah took them and departed for the fair. But",392,,

This attack of Al-barrédh passed afterwards into a proverb.   “ The poet Abi Tem4m has said    BLE Keel sil SU nbsp pe iil,    ‘ This is the youth whom nights know well; as likewise the deserts, as dangerous as the deadly  * snakes :   ‘ For every day, on the return of night, he has to withstand an attack as formidable as those of  * Al-barrddh.’   “ They say that the memorable attacks «(Gis of the times before Mohammed were three in number ;  “those posterior to Islim two. The former are:—Ist. The attack made by Al-barrédh upon ’Orwah,  “which we have just recounted. 2nd. The attack of Al-héreth Ibn Dhélim, who not only killed his  “ adversary, Khaled Ibn Ja’far Kel4b, in the presence of and quite close to the Sult4n Al-aswad, son of  “ Al-mundhir, but afterwards escaped the vengeance of that monarch. 3rd. The attack of Amri Ibn  “ ps Kolthim upon ’Amru Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, whom he killed in the capital of his states, between    “ Hirah and Forat (the Euphrates), and after dispersing his horsemen, and seizing upon his camels and  “ treasures, returned to Syria laden with plunder, having achieved the adventure alone, and without the  “* assistance of his friends, from whom he concealed his intentions.   “« These are the three famous attacks made before the times of Islam; those made afterwards are :—Ist.  “ That of ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Merwén on ’Amri Ibn Sa’id Ibni-l-’4ss, upon which there is that verse  “ which says—    © fo de adel pl ye we LE SI ope or of    “ «Certainly when the Beni Merw4n killed him, it was like the assembling of the boghdth against the  “ sakr.’ Qnd. The attack of Al-manstir on Abi Moslem. 3rd. The attack of Al-mansir upon Abi  “ Moslemah.”   The volume from which the preceding extract has been made being hitherto unknown, I shall perhaps  be excused if I here give a slight description of it.

It is divided into sixty-one chapters, under each of which the proverbial  expressions are arranged alphabetically, and according to the class to which they belong :—for instance,  Chap. 1. contains all those substantive nouns which are used in connexion with the name of God.

It may easily be imagined what assistance a work like this may afford to the scholar who has to read  without commentaries the works of Arabian orators and poets. I have often had recourse to it in this  translation, and have always met with a solution of the difficulties, otherwise insurmountable, with which  the present epistle and many other rhetorical pieces in this volume are filled.   The Library of the Brit. Mus. possesses another very useful volume, the composition of the same author.  It is a small quarto, written in rather a good hand; were it not that the character, which is slightly  approaching to ta’lik, and the almost general want of diacritical points, render its reading extremely  difficult. Otherwise it is correct, and may be about two hundred years old. The title is es! pe    1 al Nawddiru-l-hikam wa jawdmi’u-l-kalam, (the memorable sayings of the wise and the  urs q    collections of speech;) it is, as the title sufficiently implies, a collection of apophthegms arranged  under four heads :—namely, 1. The memorable sayings of Prophets: 1. Those of Khalifa and Kings:  ut. Those of Wizirs and Secretaries: 1v. Those of Philosophers, Theologians, Judges, and learned  men.   The author of both these works, and of many more equally useful and precious, is Abu-]l-mansir  ’Abdu-]-mélik Ibn Mohammed Ibn Isma’fl Ath-tha’élebi An-nisaburi, who, according to Ibn Khallek4n,  who has given his life (No. 391, Tyd. Ind.), was born in three hundred and fifty of the Hijra (a.p.  961-2), and died in four hundred and twenty-nine (a.p. 1037-8).    3 Abt Ghalib, the rhetorician. Ibn Khallekén (No. 123 in Tyd. Ind.) has given the life of this  individual, who was a native of Cordova, and whose entire name was Abi Ghalib Temém Ibn Ghélib Ibn  ""Omar. He died in Almeria, in a.a. four hundred and thirty-six (a.p. 1044). He has also mentioned the  anecdote here related, and says that the work which Abi Ghalib was thus requested to dedicate to  Mujihid was entitled ol ek Talkihu-l.’ayn, and treated of rhetoric.

They became, in the fourth century of the Hijra, the masters of great part of Syria and Mesopotamia.

Mus., No. 9575, fo. 83), an account of this individual, whose real name  Was a hw Sakit. When young he had been taken in war by the Baragh’wdttah, and sold to a man of  the name of Haddad, who sold him to ’Ali Ibn Hamid, Sultén of Cordova. On the death of his master  Sakut was liberated, but continued to serve faithfully his son Yahya, and to share the fate of the other  princes of the Beni Hamid, distinguishing himself in their.wars with the Andalusians and Africans. In  four hundred and fifty-five, when the Almoravides began to spread their conquests over Africa, Sakiit was  governor of Ceuta and Tangiers under Hasan Ibn Yahya Ibn Hamid, King of Malaga; he valiantly defended  the territories intrusted to his care, until he was at last killed in battle by the troops of Yusuf Ibn  Tishfin in four hundred and seventy-one. Sakut left a son called Dhiy4u-d-din, who succeeded him in  his government.    % This Saleh was the son of Tarif, founder of the dynasty and religious sect of the Baragh’wittah, who  reigned about T4mesn4, and the coast of the ocean along Salé, Azamér, &c., from the beginning of the  second to the middle of the fourth century of the Hijra.

Tbnu Khaldin, who transcribes almost literally’ the narrative of Al-bekri, adds many  interesting details, and corrects besides many mistakes into which that author fell. Among other things  he says as follows :—‘‘ Several authors have made great mistakes while treating on the origin of the    + ree    "" able 2 Baragh’wéttah, some counting them among the Zenétah, while others pretend that they draw  “their genealogy from Sdleh, son of Tarif, a Jew, who was the son of Simeon, son of Ya’kub. This    we    “Tarif, they say, was born and educated at LL, ye Barbétt; he travelled to the East, where he took  “lessons from ’Abdullah, the Mota’zelite, and learnt magic and other sciences; after which he came to  “ Maghreb, and settled at Tamesné, where he found some Berber tribes in a state of ignorance. These  “he taught the principles of abstinence, and succeeded in enchanting by the charms of his speech, until  “ they flocked to him from all parts, and became his followers. He then assumed the title of Prophet.  “ The same authors add that this Tarif was called Barbétti, from the place of his birth, viz. Barbétt, a  “river in the plain of wm 7 Xerez, a city of Andalus; and that this patronymic Barbatti, having been  “ accommodated to the genius of the Arabic language, was changed into Baragh’watti. Such is at least  “the explanation given of this word by the author of the Nadhamu-l-jauhar (the string of jewels), and  “ other writers on the history and genealogy of the Berber tribes, such as Al-bekri and others. But all  “ this is a manifest error, since it is well known that the Baragh’wéttah did not belong to the tribe of  “ Zenatah, but are a tribe of themselves, having a well-known residence in the neighbourhood of their  “ brethren, the Masmidah, among whom Sileh Ibn Tarif is well known.”   T ought to observe that the name of this tribe has been written Barghawatah by Quatremére, and  Barguati by Graberg, but there can be no doubt that its real spelling is that given by Ibnu Khaldin,  since not only the copy of Al-bekri is preserved in the Lib. of the Brit. Mus., No. 9577, but the history    of Morocco, attributed to Ibn Battdttah (Ar. MS. in my possession), and the Karttis, present the same  reading.",395,,

MS. in the Brit. Mus.,  No. 7352, fo. 19) speaks of a poet who flourished before the time of Mohammed, and whose name was  Al-’abbés Ibnu-l-ahnaf. Al-jiizi, in his Kitdbu-n-nikdb ’ani-l-asmd wa-l-alkdb (a treatise on Arabic  names and surnames, in Dr. Lee’s collection), says that Ahnaf was the surname of Adh-dhahhak, son of  Kays, and that it was also that of ""Okayl Ibn Mohammed. See also Abvi-l-fed4, An. Mosl. vol. i. p. 463.   By having recourse, however, to Ath-tha’dlebi (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9558, fo. 17,  verso), I find not only the names and surnames of this individual, but also the meaning of the  proverbial expression here introduced. ‘ Ahnaf, son of Kays, a king of certain districts of Arabia in  ‘the times preceding Islam, was greatly renowned for his amiable disposition, forbearance, and  “tenderness of soul. The following expression Waie)] p> (the meekness of Al-ahnaf) is much    “used by poets. Al-jahedh says it is customary among Arabian poets to speak about .)\a!    “the tenderness of soul of Lokman, or that of Lokaym, son of Lokm4n; they mention also for the  “said purpose Kays Ibn ’A’ssem, and Suwwabah Qlyo Ibn Abi Sufvan, and several other men; but we  “‘ never saw this expression used so frequently, and with so much propriety, as when applied to Al-ahnaf,  “son of Kays, who, notwithstanding that civil war and discord raged through the greatest part of  “his dominions, was nevertheless the mildest man that ever lived, so much so that neither noble nor  “ plebeian, nor woman, nor pious man, nor ancient hero, nor any of the four Khalifs who, owing to their  “« virtues, were called Al-murashshidin (directed), nor any of the great conquerors, nor any man, in fine,  ‘in his time or after his days, will be found to have equalled him in those qualities, &c.”   The author, therefore, means ironically that had Abbas Ibnu-l-ahnaf been living he might have found in  Yusuf his superior in tenderness of soul, and mildness of disposition, since he could write to a friend in so    tender a strain.    % All the copies make the name of the son to be Abvi-l-walid, like that of his father; but I believe it  to be a mistake of the author. Abi-l-walid Ibn Roshd (better known during the middle ages by the  name of Averroes) had a son named Abii Mohammed ’Abdallah Ibn Roshd, the same who is here  meant.   As Ibn Roshd was a famous physician, besides being an eminent jurisconsult, and theologian, his life  has been given at full length by Ibn Abi Ossaybi’ah (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 7340, p. 146,  verso). This life, together with those of other eminent physicians, natives of Spain, the reader will find  translated in Appendix A.    3t Abii Mohammed ’Ali Ibn Ahmed Ibn Sa’id Ibn Hazm, commonly called Ibnu Hazm, from the name  of one of his ancestors, was of Persian origin, but born at Cordova in three hundred and eighty-four of",396,,

He was the descendant of Ghilib, son of Séleh, son of Khalf, son of Ma'dén, son  of Sufyaén, son of Yezid, a freedman of Abii Sufyén. His ancestor Khalf, who was the first of his family  who entered Spain, arrived during the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ad-ddkiel, the first of the Beni Umeyyah,  and settled at Cordova. His father, Abi ’A’mir Ahmed Ibn Hazm, was Wizir to Al-mansdér Ibn Abi  ’A’mir, and died in four hundred and two, when his son succeeded him in his charge. The life of this  writer may be read in Ibn Khallekén (Tyd. Ind., No. 459), who places his death in Sha’b4n, in four  hundred and fifty-six (a.p. 1064).

His entire name was Abi Bekr Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn Mohammed Ibn Mohammed  Tbn Tofayl Al-kaysi. He was originally from Guadix, a city in the province of Granada, but resided  most of his life in that capital, where he fulfilled the duties of secretary to the governor. He was a great  physician and philosopher, and excelled above all in his knowledge of mathematics and astronomy. His  death happened at Morocco, in five hundred and eighty-one (a.p. 1185-6). Among his works Ibnu-l-  khattib mentions the epistle of Hayyi Ibn Yokttan, the same that was first published in Arabic and Latin,  by Pococke, Oxon. 1671, reprinted in 1700, and then translated into English, with excellent remarks,  by Simon Ockley, London, 1708.   According to the author of the Karttds, Ibn Tofayl was chief physician at the court of Yusuf, son  of ’Abdu-l-mumen, the second Sultan of the Almohades. See the Karttds, translated by Moura, p. 226,  and Conde (Hist. de la Dom. vol. ii. p. 8369), who calls him Ben Tafail, by mistake. Casiri, in his Bib.",397,,

All these statements  leave no doubt as to Ibn Tofayl’s surname being Abt Bekr, and not Abi Ja’far, as Pococke and those  who followed him have erroneously stated.

Ind., No. 683), and the author of the Zohru-r-riyddh (Arab.    ‘  MS. in the Brit.

On his  return to Spain he settled at Denia, then the court of Mujéhid, the Sclavonian. According to Ibn  Khallekén, ’Abdu-l-malek died in this city, but Ibn Abi Ossaybi’ah, who wrote his life, as well as  those of four other eminent physicians, places his death at Seville. Neither biographer, however, gives  the year of it; but as Mujahid, King of Denia, died, according to Adh-dhobi, (Arab. MS. in the Nat.",398,,
"    CHAP. 11.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 337    Lib. Madrid, Gg. 14,) in four hundred and thirty-six of the Hijra (a. p. 1044-5), we may be justified  in inferring that ’Abdu-l-malek died towards the middle of the fifth century of the Hijra.   3. Zohr, surnamed Abi-l-dla, learnt medicine under his father, and became chief physician and Wizir  to Aba ’Amri 'Abb4d Al-mu’atadhed-billah, King of Seville. Ibn Ab{ Ossaybi’ah (Joco laudato, fo. 143)  says that he died before five hundred and twenty-six; Ibn Khallekén that he died at Cordova in five  hundred and twenty-five (a. p. 1130-1), from an abscess between his shoulders.   4. ’Abdu-]-malek, surnamed Abi Merwén, was also an eminent physician. He learnt medicine under  his father, and entered, when still young, the household of Ibréhfm Ibn Yusuf Ibn Tfshfin, the last of the  Almoravide Sultans, after whose death he passed to the service of ’Abdu-l-mimen, the first of the Al-  muwéhedin or Almohades who ruled Spain. He was highly distinguished by the latter sovereign, who  appointed him his Wizir. See Moura’s Karttds, p. 226; D’Herb. Bib. Or. voc. Taiassir, Zohar, &c. ;  and Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. p. 132, et passim. However, both D’Herbelot and Casiri were wrong in  supposing that he professed the Jewish religion. :   This ’Abdu-l-malek is the author of several medical treatises, held in much esteem during the middle  ages, and the most important of which is pos Teysir, or ‘introduction to medicine,’ which he dedicated  to his master, the Sultén Ibréhim Ibn Yusuf, and a Latin translation of which, made from an intermediate  Hebrew version, has been printed repeatedly, and for the first time at Venice, in 1490, by Joannes .  and Gregorius de Forlivio. ‘   *Abdu-l-malek died at Seville in five hundred and fifty-seven of the Hijra (a. p. 1162). See Casiri,  Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. i. p. 132, c. 2; Abt-]-fed4é, An, Mosl. vol. iii. p. 179, and Leo Africanus, De  viris illustribus, apud Hottinger, Bibliot. Quadrip. p. 252.   5. Mohammed, surnamed Abt Bekr, son of the preceding, is generally called by biographers fac!  Al-hafidh (i. e. the descendant, or the great grandson), to distinguish him from his great grandfather,  who had the same name and surname. Like his ancestors, Mohammed followed the profession of medicine,  but he was also a distinguished theologian and an excellent poet, and is justly held by the Arabian  biographers as the most eminent individual of this family. His life may be read in Ibn Khallekén (Tyd.  Ind., No. 683), as well as in the Zohru-r-riyddk, another biographical dictionary (Arab. MS. in the  Brit. Mus., No. 7349, fo, 232). See also Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. i. p. 128, c. 2; Abd-l-fed4,  Aa. Mosl. vol. iii. p. 179; Leo Africanus, De viris illustribus, apud Hottinger, Bibliot. Quadrip. p. 252;  D'Herb. Bib. Or. voc. Tuiassir, Abdalmalek, Aben Zohar, &c.   There are various opinions upon the year of Mohammed Ibn Zohr’s death. It has been fixed by Ibn  Abi Ossaybi’ah (/oco laudato, fo. 144) in the year five hundred and ninety-six (a. p. 1199-1200). Conde  (Hist. de la Dom. vol. ii. p. 369), and Moura, in his transl. of the Karttds, place it in the twenty-first  day of the month of Dhi-l-hajjah, five hundred and ninety-five (14th Oct. a.p. 1199). Ibn Khallekan,  quoting an Andalusian writer, named Ibn Dihyah, says that he died at Morocco in five hundred and  ninety-five, at the age of ninety-four; but this must be a mistake, since, if he was born in five hundred  and seven (a. p. 1113-4), as is generally admitted, he could not be so old when he died.   Mohammed has been frequently mistaken for his father, ""Abdu-]-malek, by European as well as Eastern  biographers, who have attributed to one only the actions and works of the two, so that the celebrated  Avenzoar of the middle ages is, as it were, an imaginary personification of the two. In order, then, to  throw greater light on this important topic, and afford materials for the literary history of the Spanish  Arabs, I have translated elsewhere, from Ibn Abi Ossaybi’ah (see App. A. at the end of the vol.), the  lives of ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Zohr, and his son, Mohammed Ibn Zohr.   6. ’Abdullah, surnamed Abi Mohammed, and Jbnu-l-haf{dh also, to distinguish him from the other  members of his family, was the sixth eminent physician of the Zohr family. His life occurs in Ibn Abf   VOL. I. 2x",399,,

The  former writer, who places the birth of ’Abdullah at Seville in five hundred and seventy-seven (A.D.  1181-2), says that he died from the effects of poison at Salé, in Africa, in the year six hundred and two  of the Hijra (a. p. 1205-6), at the age of twenty-five.   7. ’Abdullah left two sons; one was named Abii Merw4n ’Abdu-l-malek, the other Abii-l-’ala Moham-  med. Both practised medicine. Ibn Ab{ Ossaybi’ah (loco laudato, fo. 146, verso) mentions them both;  but the former and elder, ’Abdu-l-malek, seems to have distinguished himself the most, since I find his  life in Ibnu-l-khattfb (Arab. MS. in my possession), as well as in Ibnu-l-abbér (Arab. MS. in the Nat.  Lib. Mad., Gg. 13). He appeara to have gained great reputation for his writings, as well as in his art.  He inhabited Seville and Granada, but the year of his death is nowhere mentioned.    ” el Al-matin (that is, ‘the solid,’) is the title of Ibnu Hayy4n’s large historical work. All the  manuscript copies of H4jf Khalfah that I have consulted read oan Al-mubeyn, by mistake. See a pre-  ceding note, p. 310.    38 Abi ’Amer (’Omar or ’Amra) Ahmed, son of Mohammed, and surnamed Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi (the  servant of his Lord), was born in Cordova in Ramadhén, two hundred and forty-six (Nov. or Dec.  a.p. 860). Both Ibn Khallekén (Tyd. Ind., No. 45) and Abii-l-fedé (An. Mosl. vol. ii. p. 411) place  his death in the year three hundred and twenty-eight (a.p. 939-40), but H4ji Khalfah, (voc. ’ikd,) no  doubt by mistake, refers it to the year three hundred and sixty-five. Casiri, who calls him Abdrabboh  (see Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. i. p. 157, and vol. ii. p. 134), and Conde, (Hist. de la Dom. vol. i. p. 425,)  confirm the former statement.   The work here alluded to is thus described by H&ji Khalfah. ‘‘ Al-’ikd (the necklace) is the title of a  “work by Abd ’Amru Ahmed Ibn Mohammed, known by the surname of Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi, a native of  “* Cordova, who died in three hundred and sixty-five (read 328). The author says in his preface that the  ‘reason why he entitled his work <l.’ikd (the necklace) was its containing many of the inestimable  “« jewels of speech, forming, as it were, a string. The work is divided into twenty-five parts, each of  “‘ which is subdivided into two, thus making in all fifty books, to each of which he gave the name of one  “ of the jewels composing a necklace ; for instance, the first part he called 3 pl Al-hilé (great pearl), &e.   «« After Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi’s death, his work was abridged by Abu Is'hék Ibrahim Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén  «« Al-kays{, of Guadix, who died in five hundred and seventy (a.p. 1174-5), as well as by Jemélu-d-din  “* Abi-l-fadhl Mohammed Ibn Mukarram Al-khazraji, who died in seven hundred and eleven (a.p.  ‘© 1311-2), and who is well known besides as the author of a very elaborate composition, entitled  “« Lisdnu-l.’arab (the language of the Arabs).”   The Bodleian Library at Oxford possesses many volumes of this excellent work, which I shall describe  briefly. It isa sort of Cyclopedia, containing various treatises upon history, genealogy, the science of  government, eloquence, justice, liberality, courage, magnanimity, women and their good qualities,  military science, weapons, horses, stratagems, hostages, encampments, &c. The work is divided  into twenty-five books, each of which has two chapters, thus making in all fifty. Each of the  books is named after one of the twenty-five pearls composing a necklace, for in Arabic either every  one of them has its particular name, or the author chose to give it, which is more probable; for  instance, the centre one he called gh! 3) Al-wdsitah, the next to the right 3 pi | Al-hili, that to  the left § pl Al-faridah, the next in order to the right § do» i Az-zabarjadah, the corresponding  one on the other side Shell Al-jumdnah, &c., all words which mean a pearl.

"    CHAP. 1.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 339    chronology of the Khalifs), is perhaps the most interesting of all, as it contains much useful information  upon the history of the Arabs both in the East and West. The second chapter, especially, which is  exclusively consecrated to the history of Spain, although rather concise, is in my opinion invaluable. I  shall have occasion to quote from it in the course of these notes.   The MSS. in the Bodleian containing parts of this work, which in its original state could not be  composed of much less than ten folio volumes, are Laud. 292, Marsh. 59, 320, and 321. Many of these  copies, however, being only repetitions of the same volume, the work is incomplete.   The life of Abd ’Amer Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi may be read in the Mattmahu-l-anfus, by Al-fat’h,  (Ar. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9580, fo. 142, verso,) as well as in the Jadhwatu-l-muktabis, by Al-  homaydi, (Ar. MS, in the Bodl. Lib., Hunt. No. 464, fo. 43.) The last-mentioned writer states that  he saw in Cordova a copy of Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi’s work divided into twenty books, and written by the  author himself for the use of the Am{fr, Al-hakem, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmén III. This agrees very  well with what Conde (Hist. de la Dom. vol. i. p. 425) says, no doubt borrowed from the same source ;  but how to reconcile the titles of the above books with those given by the Spanish translator I am at a  loss to determine, being as follow: ‘the sky, the stars, the first dawn of day, day, night, the bower,  the cloud, love, repentance, the gazelle, &c.’!    ® Abi Nasr Al-fatth Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Obeyd-illah Ibn Kh&kén Al-kaysi is well known as the  author of a work entitled Kaldyidu-l.’ikiydn fi mahdseni-l-a’ydén (gold chains in the laudable actions of  the illustrious), being a biography of Spanish poets who were his contemporaries, with extracts from  their poems. The work is divided into four parts; the first comprising the Kings, the second the  Wizirs, the third the Kédis and theologians, and the fourth the poets not belonging to either of the above  classes. Ibn Kh4k4n wrote another work, entitled ()»|    eo Lill pees GI pee  lass! Mattmahu-l-anfus wa masrahu-t-tdénnus ft milhi ahli-l-andalusi, ‘ spot of recreation of the eyes  and the field for familiarity on the witty sayings of the people of Andalus.’ These two works in themselves  have little or no historical value, being mostly extracts from the works of eminent poets who were his  contemporaries, preceded by short biographical accounts of their authors. Even these are almost entirely  destitute of such data as might throw light on the history of the times. The birth-place, profession,  and age of the poet, are often omitted, and the generality of the articles contain nothing but the  most immoderate praises of the authors to whom they were consecrated. As literary productions,  however, the works are considered by the best Arabian critics to possess undeniable merit. They are  written throughout in rhymed prose, strewn with metaphorical expressions, which make their perusal a  matter of great labour and difficulty. As it is, they may be of great assistance to those who wish to gain  a knowledge of the state of Arabian literature in Spain during the fifth century of the Hijra; although, if  we are to believe the historian As-sadfi, the merits of Ibn Khékén as a writer and a critic must be greatly  reduced by the fact that his praises or his criticisms were often influenced by low motives: indeed, the  above-mentioned historian, who wrote Ibn Khékén’s life in his Al-wdft fi-l-wafiydt (Arab. MS. in my  possession), represents him as a man of immense talents and undisputed merit as a poet and a grammarian,  but of dissipated life and low morals. He says that “ when he had fixed upon the composition  “of the Kaldyid, he wrote to all the eminent poets, distinguished authors, and great men of his time,  ‘announcing to them his intention of writing a book, and begging them to send him some of their  “* compositions ; that all complied with his request, fearing his bad disposition, and sent along with them  “‘a present in money; by which means they ensured his praises. All those who did not openly bribe  “' him he treated in the most severe manner.”",401,,

Catal., No. 734; Bib. Bodl. Cat. by Uri and Nicoll, No. 706; Bib. Lugd.  Bat., No. 1450; Bib. Esc., No. 436. A splendid copy, beautifully executed in a clear, large Eastern hand,  having the titles written in gold upon blue ground, and formerly in the possession of Sale, the translator  of the Korén, is now preserved in the Radcliffe Lib. at Oxford, K. 2-24. It was transcribed a.H. seven  hundred and twenty-seven (a.p. 1327), by Mohammed Ibn Sélik. The Library of the British Museum  possesses likewise a copy of this excellent work, in fo. (No. 9599), bound together with a commentary  on the Makssirah of Ibn Hizem. | It is fairly executed in the Maghrebi character, and bears the date of  Saturday, the sixth of Dhi-l-hajjah, a.H. one thousand one hundred and twenty-three (answering to  the month of Feb. 1711). The name of the copyist is Ahmed Ibnu-l-huseyn Ibn Mohammed Al-  warashén Al-makudi, an inhabitant of Fez. There are two more MSS. in the Brit. Mus., bearing also  the title of Kaldyidu-l.’ikiydn, one No. 7525 in quarto, the other No. 9580 in octavo; but although  both are the work of Al-fat‘h, their contents are quite different, as I have already remarked. (See  Preface). The copy of this work which I have used in my quotations is one in my possession, written  in the Maghreb{ or Western hand, about the middle of the sixteenth century of our era. See ibid.   The life of Ibn Khdk4n occurs in most Arabian biographers of note; it is to be found in Ibn Khal-  lekén (No. 536, Tyd. Ind.), in the Zohru-r-riyddh, in As-sadfi, and Abd-l-mahésen, Abi-l-fedé, An.  Mosl. vol. iii. p. 485, and Abd-l-faraj. See also Jones, De Poes. Asiat. p. 429. The first-mentioned  writer makes him a native of Seville, but does not give the year of his birth.   Al-fat'h was put to death in Morocco at the beginning of five hundred and twenty-nine (Oct. a. p.  1134), or according to others in five hundred and thirty-five (a. p. 1147-8), by order of Abi-l-hasan  *Ali Ibn Yusuf Ibn T4shfin, second Sultén of the Almoravides, to whose brother, Abti Is‘hak Ibraéhim, he  had dedicated his Kaldyid.    # Instead of Khassél, I found, when it was too late, that the name of that poet was to be written thus,  Khissdl. He was a famous grammarian and rhetorician, who flourished in the sixth century of the Hijra.  His entire name was Dhi-l-wizaréteyn Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Abi-]-khiss4l Al-ghéfeki Ash-  shektiri Al-jayyéni (of Jaen), so called because he was originally from Segura, a town in the neigh-  bourhood, and belonged to the tribe of Ghéfek. He left many works on various topics, some of which  are preserved in the Library of the Escurial.   Treating on this author, Casiri made two great mistakes. He says (see vol. ii. p. 163 of his Bib. Ar.  Hisp. Esc.) “‘ Eum originem trazisse a loco nomine § ) 9.9 Vescara dicitur ;” (that he was originally from  a place called Vescara.) I need not observe that there never was such a place in Spain; but Casiri  thought that the letter __, formed part of the word, whereas it is a preposition annexed to the word    5 yt Shekirah, the town of his birth. He says also (see ibid. vol. ii. p. 385) that Ibn Abi-]-khiss4l  flourished in the fifth century of the Hijra. This is an evident mistake: the historian Al-fat'h, who  gave the life of that author in his Al-kaldyid (Ar. MS. in my possession), says that he was Wizir to one  of the Almoravide Sult4ns of Spain, and that he knew him in five hundred and fifteen of the Hijra  (a.p. 1121-2). I further learn from Al-kodha’i (Ar. MS. in the Nat. Lib. Mad., Gg. 14) that Ibn  Abi-l-khissél died in Cordova in five hundred and forty of the Hijra (a. p. 1114-5), a statement which  I find also confirmed by Ibnu-l-abbér in his biographical dictionary of illustrious men (Ar. MS. in the  Nat. Lib. Mad., Gg. 12).   The work here mentioned as being the composition of Ibn Abj-1-khissdl—the Baus Tarstlah—  does not occur in H4ji Khalfah’s Bibliographical Index.

He died in that city in the month of Dh{-l-ka’dah, six hundred and thirty-nine  (a.p. 1241).

Having afterwards lost the favour  of his monarch, Ibn ’Ammiér fled the court and betook himself to Silves, where he revolted, and assumed  the title of king.

Another is  Yahya Ibn Yahya Ibn Kasim, whom Casiri (Bib. Arab. Hisp. Esc. vol. i. p. 454) asserts to have flourished  in the fourth century of the Hijra.

Ar. Hisp. Esc., as translated  from Adh-dhobi. Al-makkar{ speaks of him in Book v. Part i. fo. 96, verso, where he gives the  lives of the Andalusians who visited the East. In the number is that of ’Abdu-l-mélik, who went to Mekka,  where he remained a considerable time, profiting by the lessons of Malik Ibn Ans, and then returned to  his native land, where he is said to have written no Jess than one thousand different works upon various  topics, and to have been most instrumental in substituting the rite of his master for that of Al-auz4’el,  which was formerly practised. (See Conde, Hist. de la Dom. vol. i. p. 268). Ibn Habib died at Cordova  in two hundred and thirty-eight (a. p. 853).   *Abdu-l-mélik was known by the surname of Abi Merwdn and the patronymic As-solami, because he  belonged to the tribe of Solaym.

There is at present no town of this name in Spain, but I find in Idrisi, Yakut, and other geographers,  that there once stood on the road from Cordova to Calatrava a large castle called Hisn Ghdfek. The  distances given by the former writer are as follow: from Cordova, in a northern direction, to Arles  eleven miles ; to D4r Al-bakar six; to Petroches forty; to Gh&fek seven; to Jebal-’A'mir thirty. Ghéfek  must therefore have stood seven miles north from the present village of los Pedroches.    a7 ed that is, Hisnu-l-mudawar (the round castle), now Almodovar del Rio, fifteen miles from  Cordova, on the left bank of the Guadalquivir.    © Estepa is written thus, %lio!

Its Roman name was evidently Lucania, from Lucus, owing to the extensive    forests in the neighbourhood. pail Al-kosseyr (the small castle), is a diminutive from Al-kassr (in    Spanish Alcazar), ‘a castle.’ It may be either the present town of Alcozer, fourteen miles south of  Cordova, or the village of Alcazarejos in the same neighbourhood.    © ab ¥ A’gharndttah is for Gharndttah, since it is not an uncommon thing for the Arabs to add a  hamza before the first letter of foreign words, especially when these begin with a harsh letter; for  instance, from Kpares they made Ahkritis, from KAiva Iklim, from Greecus Aghrik, from Paved Igitkt, &c.

But the Arabian historian translated by him    says no such thing; Casiri misunderstood his words, which are § 2 3S Ku de aoe! eo! ebb ¥  “yy ta Band ran A A A  en oy) po goad y pel that is, ‘Gharn4ttah is the foreign or barbarous name for the capital of the    province or district of Elvira, which was also called (by the Arabs) Shému-l-andalus,’ the ‘ Damascus of  Andalus.’”   The supposition that the city of Granada owes its name to the resemblance it bears to a ripe pome-  granate (granatum), either in shape to the open halves of the fruit, or in the multitude of its houses lying  close together like the seeds of that fruit, is scarcely admissible ; for, supposing the comparison to be a just  one as applied to that city in the times of its greatest splendour, it could by no means be so when  speaking of a small town or castle, such as Granada is represented by all the Arabian writers before the  fifth century of the Hijra. Nor is the conjecture given out by the antiquarian Pedraza (Hist. Ecclesi-  astica de Granada, Gran. 1638, fo. 21, et seg.) entitled to more credit, namely, that the city was so called  from its being the spot where that fruit was first introduced from Africa; for I find in Ibnu-l-awam  (see the Spanish translation by Banqueri, Mad. 1802, vol. i. fo. 273) that the pomegranate was originally  brought from Syria to Spain during the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahmén I., who had it planted first in his  gardens at Cordova (towards a. H. 160), and then distributed the seed all over Spain, and long before that  time the above-mentioned city bore the same name as at present. The fact of the author himself  stating that the word A'gharndttah meant a pomegranate in the language of the Christians cannot, for  several reasons, be considered as adding any weight to the opinion that the city of Granada received the  name of the pomegranate either from its founders, whoever they may be, or from the Africans under  Habis, when that sovereign transferred to it the seat of his government: firstly, because, as I shall  show hereafter, the ancient name for that city was not <A’gharndttah, nor Gharndttak, but xb | xy  Karndttah; secondly, because it is evident that Al-makkari had no other authority for his statement  than the words of some obscure writer, who caught at the resemblance between the two words—a  thing, unluckily, of too frequent occurrence among his countrymen ; and lastly, because, had any of  the reasons above stated influenced the African settlers in choosing a name for their city, they would  certainly have called it wy Roman, (the name of the pomegranate in Arabic,) and by no means  A’gharndttah, from granatum. The same might be said of more ancient settlers.   Others incline to the belief that Karndttah or Gharndttah is a Phoenician word. Conde, in his notes to  the description of Spain by the geographer Idrisi, (Mad. 1799, p. 188,) thought it a compound of two  Phoenician words, Ghdr and ndttak, meaning ‘the cave of the mountain,’ and the same opinion is  entertained by Aldrete (Antig. de Espana y Africa, Amberes, 1614, p. 85) and other estimable  antiquarians. Marineo Siculo (De las cosas memorables de Espaia, fo. Alcalé, 1530, p. 150), and Eche-  varria (Paseos por Granada, p. 17) go still further, since they assert, without the least authority, that  those words mean ‘the cave of Ndttah,’ from the name of a Goddess so called, whom the inhabitants  used to worship in a subterranean temple.   Having disposed of my objections as to the origin assigned to its name, I shall now proceed to contra-  dict the opinion of Marmol, and his followers Pedraza and Echevarria, who pretend that Granada was a  foundation of the Arabs.    That a town called xb 45 Fs Karndttah existed before the Saracen invasion on the site now occupied by    Granada cannot be doubted, for we are told by the Arabian writers that, before undertaking the conquest  of Toledo, T4rik dispatched one of his lieutenants with a division of his army towards Malaga, Illiberis",408,,

Ar-r4zi, who wrote in the ninth century, in  describing the territory round Elvira, says, ‘‘ And in this district is the town of Karndttah, called also  “the city of the Jews, because peopled by them, and Karndttah is the oldest town in all the district of  “ Elvira.” Ibnu-l-khattib, the celebrated Wizir and historian, who treated with so much learning on the  antiquities of his native city, joins in the opinion entertained by Ar-rézi. That this Karndttah was a very  inconsiderable town in the times that preceded the invasion is, on the other hand, to be inferred from  the fact that its name is nowhere mentioned, either by the Roman geographers, or in the national  councils of the Goths. We are, therefore, justified in asserting that a small town, called ‘ Karndttah,’  stood not far from Elvira (Illiberis) previous to the Saracen invasion. See the Spanish translation of  Rasis; Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 251; Conde, Hist. de la Dom. vol. i. pp. 37, 51; and  Marmol, Reb. de los Moriscos, fo. 5, 6, et seq.   As to its being a Pheenician colony, it seems probable enough. From time immemorial that enterprising  nation had made settlements on the southern coast of Spain, and the names of Cartama, Carteia, Kar-  chedone (Archidona), Cartajima, Cartaojan, and others, beginning (like Karnéttah) with Kar or Karta,  NIV meaning a city in the Pheenician language, give plausibility to the conjecture. Besides, I have  already stated that the name of that town is invariably written by ancient authors thus, Xb) 8 Karndttah,  and I may add to this that a ‘city of the same name is placed by Idrisi (see the French transl., vol. i.  Pp. 202, 226, et passim), Ibnu Khaldin, fo. 86-104, et passim, and Al-bekri, (Arab. MS. in the Brit.  Mus., No. 9577, p. 85, verso,) in that part of Africa which faces the coast of Granada. Whether the word  Keradttah means the cave of the mountain or not I am unable to determine, as I am not of the number  of those who believe that Phoenician words may be invariably interpreted by means of the Hebrew  language; but think, on the contrary, that without a deep knowledge of the native dialects of Africa all  etymological researches in that quarter must necessarily fail.   I ought to observe that Al-makkari being a mere compiler, and professing only to transcribe the  narrative of historians of various ages and countries, it occurs frequently that the name of a town is spelt  in three or four different ways in the same page. It is therefore not uncommon to find the name of this  city written Karadttah, Karandttah, Gharandttah, Agharndttah, Aghrandttah, in the course of two or  three pages. In such cases I have made it a point to preserve as much as possible the orthography of  the different authors, lest, by attempting uniformity, I should destroy the historical evidence.

Its present name is Xenil; it takes its rise amidst the snow hills of the Sierra  Nevada, in the ravine called ‘‘ Barranco del infierno;” it then descends to Guejar in the Vega of  Granada, which, after receiving several small tributaries, it leaves at Loxa, and proceeds to the walls  of Ezija, to mix its waters with those of the Guadalquivir near Palma.   As the western Arabs dispose their alphabet in a different order to that of the Orientals, 80 does the  numerical value of their letters vary. Otherwise, the letter shin would mean three hundred. Miguel de  Luna, the converted Moor, interpreter of Philip II., who in 1592 published a pretended translation of a  history of Spain under the Arabs, must have had a vague notion of this, for he tells us (p. 310, ed. of  Valencia, 1646,) that his countrymen called the Singilis Saanil, which in their language meant ‘a second  Nile, or an imitation of the Nile.’    72 The Roman name for Darro, one of the rivers of Granada, was Salon. It was still called so in the  tenth century, since the Spanish translation of Ar-rézi gives it no other name. In later times, however,  it received that of Darro, which has been supposed to mean giving gold, quasi ‘ dat aurum,’ owing to  the gold which has for ages been found in its sands. The etymology may not be true; it is at least  ingenious. According to Pedraza, the city of Granada, in 1520, presented the Emperor Charles V. with  a crown made entirely of the gold collected in this river. (Pedraza, Antig. de Granada, p. 33; Lucio  Marineo Siculo, Descrip. de Granada.) I find the name of this river written thus san in Ibnu-l-khatth,    and he Haddrok in more ancient writers, like Ibn Séhibi-s-salét. (Arab. MS. in the Bodl. Lib.,    Marsh. No. 433.) Might not the word Haddrohk, from je Haddér, which means ‘the rapidity with  which a swollen river comes down from the mountains,’ be the origin of the word Darro?    78 The travels of Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Al-lawéti At-tanji, known by the surname  of Ibn Battittah, have already been made known to the public by the extracts published in 1818  by Mesers. Apetz and Kosegarthen, and by the English translation of the epitome made by Professor  Lee, of Cambridge, in 1829, and published under the auspices of the Oriental Translation Fund. This  would have rendered any further notice of this famous traveller or his writings superfluous, had I not a  few years ago, and since the publication of the said translation, procured from Fez an ancient and  beautifully written copy of the original travels, which I have almost entirely translated, and think of  committing to the press. .   It has long been thought, owing to a mistake of Mr. Burckhardt (see Travels in Nubia, p. 534),  that Ibn Jazzi-l-kelbi had written an epitome of the travels of Ibn Battvttah, which epitome had been  further abridged by an author named Mohammed Ibn Fat/h-allah Al-baylini: at least such is the opinion  entertained by the learned translator of his travels. (See The Travels of Ibn Batita, London, 1829,  Pref. p. x.) The last mentioned work being in reality an abridgement of a book written by Ibn Jazzi-  1-kelbi, who himself was a distinct man from the traveller, it was naturally supposed that Ibn Jazzi-l-kelb{  was only the epitomiser of the narrative of the traveller himself. But as this was nowhere to be found,  and the supposed epitome itself was a book of the greatest rarity, the error was necessarily persevered  in until we should find a copy of Ibn Jazzi’s work. I now possess a very handsome copy of this MS.,  executed a.H. one thousand one hundred and thirty-nine (a.p. 1726-7). It is a large folio volume of  about seven hundred closely-written pages, and contains twice as much matter as the epitome translated  by Professor Lee, of Cambridge. The work is a narrative of the travels of Ibn Battiittah, not, indeed,  written by himself,—for, like the famous traveller Marco Polo, he never sat down to commit to paper his",410,,

Tbn Jazz{ informs us in his preface that on the arrival of Ibn Battittah at Fez, after returning from  his travels in Siid4n, so much curiosity was excited at court that the Sultan himself wished to hear his  adventures, and after listening to him for several consecutive nights, ordered that the whole should be  drawn up, and, after the necessary revision by the traveller, made into a book.   I ought to state that among my manuscripts I possess one attributed to Ibn Battiittah (see Preface).  It is a small quarto of about two hundred pages, containing a history of Morocco, with this title,  ROSS jLEsl $5 ost Bb ysl Ulex! (variegated silken robes on the history of Morocco). It begins  with the foundation of the city of Morocco by Abi Bekr Ibn ’Omar, the first of the Lamtumnites or  Almoravides, in the year four hundred and sixty-two (a.p. 1069-70), and after recounting the events of  the various dynasties that ruled over Maghrebu-l-aksd, ends with Abt T4shfin ’Abdu-r-rahméa, of the  family of the Benf ’Abdu-l-hakk (or Merinites as they are afterwards called), son of the Sultén Abii-l-  hasan ’Alf, and grandson of Abt Sa’id, who reigned from a.p. 13898 to 1420. It is clear, from the  inspection of this date, that the work could not have been written by Ibn Battittah. That traveller  having left Tangiers, his native city, in 1325, at the age of twenty-two, must have been fifty years old  when he returned in 1353, after twenty-eight years’ peregrination : if we add to this forty-five years till  the accession of Abi Tashfin, he must have been at least ninety-five Arabian or ninety-two Christian  years old when he wrote. As it is by no means an uncommon thing among Arabian booksellers to  ascribe their books to some popular author, in order to enhance the value of their merchandize, I would  not have mentioned this circumstance had I not seen in the Library at Paris a copy of the same work,  marked No. 825, and the author of which is said to be one ’Abdullah Ibn Battittah.

(Rebelion de los Moriscos, fo. 4, c. ii.) mistook for an Arabic word meaning ‘a sterile and unfruitful  country.’    77 It was not until the year four hundred and three of the Hijra, or thereabout, (a.p. 1012-3,) that  the city of Granada acquired some importance. Before that time it is occasionally mentioned by Arabian  historians, but always as a dependency of Elvira (Illiberis). During the civil wars between the Berbers  and the Arabs, Zéwi Ibn Zeyri Ibn Men4d As-senhéji, an African chief, who held the government of the  southern coast of Spain from Malaga to Almeria, declared himself independent, and transferred the seat  of his empire from Elvira to Granada. Little by little the whole population migrated, so that when  Ibnu-l-khattib wrote, (a.H. 770,) Illiberis had dwindled into an insignificant village, and Granada risen  to be a magnificent capital.   Marmol attributes the foundation of this cassdbah or citadel, which in his days was still called kassdbah  jadidah or alcazaba nueva, to his successor, Habiis. See Reb. de los Mor. fo. 5.    7e Bédis was not the son of Zéwi As-senhéji, as here stated, for that prince left no sons, but was  succeeded by his nephew Habtis Ibn Mékesen, who, at his death in a.m. 429, was succeeded by his son    Badis. His name is sometimes written ob Bédis, and at others rel Bédis.    As the Arabian geographers and historians often do nothing more than copy each other without the least  criticism, the mistake here made by Al-makkari, and which he no doubt copied from an Eastern writer  not well versed in the history of Spain, has, probably from the same source, been adopted by several  geographers. See Ibnu-l-wardi (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9590, fo. 15, verso), and the  * Ajdyibu-l-makhhikdt (Arab. MS, ib., No. 7504, fo. 24).    a) ype Sholayr is the name given by the Arabs to that chain of mountains called by the ancients  Orospeda, (now Sierra Nevada,) and at the foot of which stood the Roman city of Mliberis. The range  nearest to Granada is now called Sierra de Elvira.   The word Sholayr, written us above, conveys no meaning whatever in Arabic; but Pedraza, the Gra-  nadine antiquarian, with that characteristic aptness of his countrymen to distort the Arabic names of  towns, rivers, and mountains, into a signification congenial with their theories, pretends that the word  Sholayr is a compound of two Spanish words, sol and aire (sun and air), and that the mountains were 80  called by the Arabs, owing to their elevation! (Antig. de Granada, fo. 8, verso.) The Spanish translation  of Ar-rézi says that the meaning of the word Sholayr is ‘ Monte de la elada’ (the mountain of the  snow). But, I repeat, the word Sholayr is not Arabic, and although it might be one of the many words  introduced by the African settlers into the language of the Spanish Moslems, I know of no Berber dialect  in which the word Sholayr means ‘snow.’ Ibnu-l-khattib, in the extracts given by Casiri (Bib. Ar.  Hisp. Esc, vol. ii. p. 248), calls it sls Pd se viz., ‘the snowy mountains (called) Sholayr,’ whence    I infer that the word Sholayr could never mean snow. The point, however, is well worth the investigation  of the antiquarian, as it may lead us to discover the origin of the modern denomination of the entire  range—Sierra Nevada.    8 The word translated by ‘ watch-tower’ is dell Talt’ah, a tower, or building, placed on an eminence,    so as to command a great expanse of territory.

This decided me to adopt the former reading, especially as the trans-  position of one of the points was sufficient to produce that change.   “ Nazhin,” says Ibnu-1-khattfb, (loco laudato,) ‘‘ was the daughter of Abi Bekr Al-ghosini. She was  “ better known by her patronymic Kan Al-kal’aiyyeh or Al-kal’aiyyah: she was an eloquent poetess,  “ well versed in history and literature, and flourished in the sixth century of the Hijra. Her principal    “* merit consisted in the beauty of the similes which she used in her poems.” See also Casiri (Bib. Ar.  Hisp. Esc. vol. i. p. 102), who makes her a native of Seville.    Instead of Al-kal’aiyyah, B. reads dsc iil) Al-hald’iyyah. Both are patronymics from Al-kal’ahk  (Alcalé la Real), near Granada. They might also be referred to the diminutive Al-koleiyyah (Alcolea), in    -&  which case the patronymic ought to be pronounced xsi!) Al-koleyiyyah.    % Tbna-l-khattib has no separate article respecting Zeynab in his Biographical Dictionary, but he  epeaks of her under that of her sister Hamdah, who was also a famous poetess. He says that they were  the daughters of Zey4d the bookseller, KJ] (Al-muktib), and that they inhabited ie! sol, Wida-l-  jammah (Al-hama ?) near _¢ |) Bddf, in the district of Guadix. Ibnu-l-abbér (Ar. MS. in the Nat.    Lib. Mad., Gg. 12) says that both were good poetesses, besides being well versed in all the branches of  literature ; that they were very handsome, rich, amiable, and modest, only that their love of science  threw them into the company of learned men: the author observes, however, that they associated with  them with the greatest decency and composure, and without violating the strict rules of their sex.    > Hafsah was the daughter of the Héji (not Al-hejj4j, as in the text,) Ar-rakiini. She was a native  of Granada, and died at Morocco towards the end of five hundred and eighty, or the beginning of the  ensuing year (a.p. 1184-5). Her life occurs in Ibnu-l-khattfb’s Biographical Dictionary of illustrious  Granadians. She is likewise mentioned by Ibnu-l-abbér in his Tahfatu-l-kidim. See Casiri, Bib. Ar.  Hisp.

He was a native of Granada, but his family were originally from <J 3 Huelma,  a village in the Alpuxarras. Ibnu Jazzi died in seven hundred and forty-one (a. p. 1340-1).   A son of his, named Ahmed, was still living, according to Ibnu-]-khattfb (/oco /audato), in seven hundred  and sixty-three (a.p. 1361-2), filling the duties of KAdf of the principal mosque at Granada, and preacher  at that of the royal palace of the Al-hamrah in that city.    CHF pes Al-busherak, that is, place of pasturage, from basherah, which means ‘grass;’ at least such  appears to be the probable etymology of this word, which Marmol Carvajal thought to mean ‘the quarrel-  some’ (§ o 9) I suppose), because, says that author, long after the conquest of Spain by the Arabs, the  Christians held out a long time in the mountain passes for which that district is famous. (Rebel. de los  Mor. p. 16.) Pedraza, the Granadian antiquarian, with his usual perspicuity, says that the Alpuxarras  were so called from Abrahem Abuxarra, one of Tarif’s officers, who subdued them! I need not show  the extravagance of such etymology, which Pedraza borrowed from that amusing romance, La perdida de  Espana, ed. of Valencia, 1646, p. 54. See Hist. Eccles. p. 89.    % Al-munékab, or rather Al-mandkib, is the plural of Xi. Mankabah, which means a ‘ gorge, a pass in  the mountains,’—an etymology which agrees well with the situation of that town,—without plunging,  like Conde, into an ocean of conjectures, and supposing the word Almunecar to be a corruption of Al-  mune-caria, which that author pretends means a garrison town, forgetting that the Arabs never prefix the  adjective to the substantive. (Geog. del Nub. p. 224.) The author of the Audhahu-l-mesdlek (fo. 157,    verso) writes it thus, ean Al-munnekkab, which accounts for the Spaniards adopting the letter #  in the pronunciation of that word. It was there that ’Abdu-r-rahmin I. landed from Africa when he  came to the conquest of Spain. -   Almufecar is the same town which the Roman geographers designate often by the names of Ezi,  Firmum Julium Sexi, Municipium Ezitanum.    9% | have already observed (see Note 69) that, owing to the system adopted by Al-makkari in writing  history, namely, transcribing the narrative of writers of various ages and countries, there must be consider-  able difference in the mode of spelling.

If the word be spelt as I have    written it, it may perhaps be meant for the Latin word delectas; if, however, the first letter has a  dhamma, thus—dhuleytah, it may easily be converted into tu leta or tu letus, which is a close translation    of enta fdrihon. The author of the Audhahu-l-mesdlek says that dhaleytah or dhuleytah mean é 8 ws  ‘thou art finishing or ending,’ but as the copyist may easily have mistaken the é for ra T believe the  former reading to be the right one.

Immediately after these verses there follow, in the principal manuscript, several odes, and other poetical  compositions, of unusual length, touching more or less upon Spain, and praising in general terms its  mild temperature, salubrious air, natural productions, fertility of the soil, &c. As the reader could not  derive much information from the translation of these poems, some of which occupy many closely-written  pages in the original, and have but a slight connexion with the main object of this work, I have thought  myself authorized to suppress them, taking care to give here the names of their authors, with such  accounts of them and their works as I have been able to collect elsewhere.   Abi I’shék Ibn Khafdjah, a poet of the fifth century, and whose life has been given by Al-fat’h, both in  his Kaldyid, fo. 71, and in his Mattmahu-l-anfus, fo. 174, verso; Tbnu-1-khattib (see Note 11, p. 306);  ’Abdu-l-mélik Ar-ro’ayni, Ibnu Sa’id, father and son (see Note 1, p. 309), &c. There is also a very long  epistle, full of rhetorical beauties, containing a poetical description of some of the Spanish cities, addressed  to ’Abdu-r-rahm4n, son of the Sultén Yvisuf, and grandson of ’Abdu-l-mimen. The author is Abi  Bahr Sefwan Ibn Idris. See Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. pp. 97, 598.    101 KaPat-Rabdh (the castle of Rabéh), which Conde (see notes to the description of Spain by the  geographer Idrisi, fo. 211) translated by ‘a capacious or roomy castle,’ was so called from the name  of its founder ’Ali Ibn Rabéh Al-lakhmi, an illustrious Arab, who is supposed by some to have been one  of the followers of the Prophet who entered Spain with Miisa.    102 It appears evident that Malaga and the surrounding districts were called by the Arabian settlers    & 2 Rayah, from the name of a city and province in Persia called wy Rayya, much in the same manner  as Jaen was called Kennesrin; Seville, Hems (Emesa); Granada, Shém (Damascus) ; Murcia, Misr, &c.,  after similar cities in the East. Rayya is the name of a district of Persia, whence, according to Ar-rézi,  who was originally from it, numerous settlers came to Spain, who, at the division of the lands among  the Arabs, obtained for their share the country round Malaga. Adh-dhobi, in his Bigh'yatu-l-multamis  (Arab. MS. in the Nat. Lib. Mad., Gg. 14, p. 160), says that part of the territory of Malaga was  peopled by settlers from Al-urdan (Jordan), who gave it the name of their country, and called it Al-urdda.  However, although Malaga and its territory may have been called Rayya, there must have been besides in  the neighbourhood of that city another town, perhaps founded by the same settlers, and which received  also from them the name of Rayya, for Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 103), in translating an  article from Ibnu-l-khattib, speaks of a town called Raya, belonging to the district of Archidona (Kap-  xntev). This I believe stood on the site now occupied by the hamlet of Zafarraya, (the fields of  Rayya?) eighteen miles from Archidona and twenty-five from Malaga, unless it be the town of Arrayate,  which is at a few miles from the former city. Conde was wrong in supposing that Raya was Rute. See  notes to Idrisi, p. 187.    103 All the copies read ues but I know of no place on the coast of Malaga answering this description.  Perhaps yt Bélesh or pe Velez, twelve miles east of Malaga, is meant. Al-bekri (/oco laudato,    fo. 63) speaks of a sea-port called ub Bélish or Bélish, which stood opposite to Malaga on the African  coast, and settlers from which founded in all probability the Spanish town.    ™ One of the signs of royalty among the Arabs, Abii Zeyd Ibn Khaldin says, consisted in having  their names and surnames woven into the skirt of their robes.

I think it was so called to distinguish it from another    town also called Bélesh, which Al-bekri places on the coast of Africa, opposite to the former. See  Note 103, p. 356.    NO Nerja, which in the sixteenth century was called Nédrija, (see Marmol, loco laudato, fo. 68,) is a  sea-port between Velez and Almunecar.    ""1 Al-hamah derives its name from the hot springs in the neighbourhood; Al-hammah, in Arabic,  meaning ‘hot springs’ or ‘therme.’ There is another town of the same name in the district of Almeria on  the banks of the river Gergal, which is called Al-hama /a seca (the dry) to distinguish it from the  former.    ""2 Kheyrdn was a Sclavonian eunuch and confidential servant of the famous Al-manstr Ibn Abj ’A’mir,  who, in reward for his services, conferred on him the government of the province of Almeria. On the  death of his master, and during the civil wars that arose between the Africans and the Spanish Arabs,  Kheyrén naturally embraced the party of the Sultans of the family of Umeyyah, and, like the other  generals of Al-manstr, proclaimed himself independent in his government. He seems, however, not to  have assumed the title of king, but to have contented himself with that of Hdjib or prime minister, for,  like the other rebels, he pretended to administer his possessions in the absence only of the legitimate  sovereign of the house of Umeyyah.

M4 Dock-yard in Arabic is ixio At) dar-san’ah, that is, ‘house of construction,’ a name which the  Spanish Arabs applied not only to the dock-yards where ships were built or careened, but also to the  magazines where weapons and other warlike implements were either manufactured or stored. From ddr-  san’ah the Spaniards have since made the word atarazana, which conveys the same meaning. The same  word was further corrupted into darsena (a place in a harbour to repair ships), and arsenal (a dock-yard),  which has also passed into French and Italian. There are still in some of the sea-ports of Spain  buildings of this kind constructed by the Arabs, or erected by the Christians on their model, as the  atarazanas of Malaga, Seville, Barcelona, Tarragona, &c. .   Almeria was, during the empire of the Beni Umeyyah, the principal dock-yard on the coast of the  Mediterranean. See Appendix B. at the end of this volume, where the reader will find, in a passage  translated from Abti Zeyd Ibn Khaldiin, much that is interesting upon the navy and maritime forces of  the western Arabs.    Ns rai dibdj is a generic word for all sorts of silken stuff dyed of various colours. The Spaniards    have made from it the words dibujo and dibujar, which mean ‘a drawing’ and ‘to draw.’    6 The meaning of the word tirdz has already been explained. Both Ibnu-l-wardi (Joco laudato, fo.  15, verso) and the author of the ’Ajdyibu-l-makhlikit (fo. 24, verso) praise the city of Almeria for its  manufactures of these royal dresses.    F  7 Ns holol, or rather holal, the plural of Aillah, means a species of silken robe worked in stripes.    8 A. reads Ye go a! askdtin; B. more correctly 5) joa. askalatin, which means scarlet. That    word seems to be the origin of the word scarlatum, which, according to Ducange (see Gloss. vol. vi.  p. 202), was used in Low Latin. Spanish, escarlata; French, écarlate; Italian, scarlatto.    19 Instead of ute ’ Atdbt, or ’Itdbt, the principal MS. reads ale *Andbi, but I believe the former  to be the correct reading, for I find in Ibn Bashktiw4l that there was in Baghdad a street called whic  ’Atib, in which there were several manufactures of silken stuffs, and it is likely that these were thus  denominated from the spot of their fabrication.   The author of the ’Ajdyibu-l-makhlikdt (fo. 24, verso) adds that there were at Almeria fabrics of candied  fruits, of which a considerable exportation took place every year for the ports of Africa and Egypt; he  adds also that at one time the number of baths and inns, fonddk, (Italian, fondaco, Spanish, fonda,)    amounted to one thousand, including only in this number those that had shutting doors (jle0    Abi Ja’far Ibn X sis Khatimah (but more correctly X3|5.

"    CHAP. I1.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 359    The life of the author himself was written in great detail by Ibnu-l-khattib. His entire name was  Abi Ja’far Ahmed Ibn ’Ali Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Ali Ibn Mohammed. He was known by the surname of  Tbn Khatimah, and used the patronymic ‘ Al-’anséri.’ He was born at Almeria in seven hundred and  twenty-four (a.p. 1323-4). He was still living when Ibnu-l-khattib wrote, viz., in Sha’ban, a.n. seven  hundred and seventy (a.p. 1369). ,   There is still another history of Almeria which Ibnu-l-khattib mentions repeatedly, and the author of  which is said to be Abti-l-barkéh Ibnu-1-héj. See Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 310, c. 2.    1 The word wy, J F bardrid, thus written, can be nothing else than the plural of 3 z barridah, a  word not to be found either in Jeuhari or Firizab4di, and which I believe belongs to some of the  African dialects. I think it means either the floor or the sides of a room, which in most houses of  wealthy people in Morocco are lined with marble flags to a height of three or more feet. It might alsu  come from 2 barro, which in Arabic as well as in Spanish means mud and clay, substances with which  the floors of Moorish houses are generally strewed to this day, and over which the tiles or marble flags  are placed. See Graberg, Specchio di Marocco, p. 139.   The mountains in the neighbourhood of Almeria abound in agates of all colours. See Bowles, Jntro-  duccion d la Historia Natural y Geografia Fisica de Espana, pp. 125, 132, et passim. It is no doubt owing  * to this circumstance that the Promontorium Charidemi received its present name of Cabo de Gata, or cape  of the agates. Samuel Bochart thought even that the word Kap:dqyov was but a corruption of the two  words char and odem, meaning, in the Punic language, the promontory of the cornelians.    12 Wdda Bejénak (the river of Bejénah), so called, no doubt, because it passed through or quite close to  Bejénah, which I believe to be the same as the Bechina of Marmol (Rebel. de los Moriscos, fo. 85, verso),  now Pechina, a village five miles from Almeria. It is probable, however, that in the eleventh century,  when Almeria became the capital of a kingdom, both places were connected together by a continuance of  buildings, for I find them frequently mentioned by the Arabian writers as being only one city. The  author of the Nashaku-l-azhdr ft ’ajdyibi-l-akttdr, a geographical treatise described elsewhere (Arab. MS.  in the Brit. Mus., No. 7508, fo. 9, verso), says that Bejénah was the ancient name for Almeria. Yakut,  in his great geographical dictionary, entitled Mu’ajemu-I-bolddn (Arab. MS. in the Bodl. Lib., No. 909),  writes thus, Bile? Bejénnah, and says that it was once a city belonging to the province of Al-bfrah  (Illiberis), but that in the course of time its inhabitants destroyed it and migrated to Almeria. Idrisi  (clim. iv. sect. 1) has words to the same effect. ‘‘ From Almeria,” he says, ‘to Bejénah the distance is  “six miles. Bejénah was once a famous city long time before Almeria had risen to importance, but the  “inhabitants of Bejénah having migrated to the latter place, Almeria became a populous city, and the  “former was deserted.” Abzii-l-fed& (see Geog. fo. 47, verso) is still more explicit; his words are.  “ Bejénah is now a small fortified town oe at seven miles from Almeria. It was in former days the  “ seat of the government of the province, but, having decayed, Almeria in time rose out of its ruins.”   I ought to observe that it is not uncommon to find, in geographical descriptions of Mohammedan Spain,  the name of this town written thus % |<? Bejdyah, by a mere transposition of one point, and the addition  of another—an easy mistake among illiterate copyists, who confounded the Bejénah of Spain with the  Bejayah or Bujéyah (now Bujeiah or Bugia) in the territory of Algiers. I may quote as a proof the copy  of Ibnu-l-wardi’s geographical work in the British Museum (No. 9590, fo. 15, verso), and the ’Ajdyibu-  l.-makhlikdt, No. 7504 in the same library, fo. 24, as well as the Arabic text of Idrisi, printed at Rome in  1592.

"    360 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [BooK I.    It is not easy to determine which was the ancient name of Bejénah. It must have been a city of some  importance under the Romans, for Ibnu-l-khattib, in his history of Granada, represents it as a large  deserted place where, as late as the fourteenth century of our era, remains of great Roman buildings were  still visible. Pliny and Ptolemy mention a sea-port called Vigi, in a situation answering to that of Almeria,  and which gave its name to the Vigitanus Golphus; might not the word Bejénah be a corruption of it ?  However, it is evident that the Arabs did there what they ‘were in the constant habit of doing wherever  they settled in Spain. Not liking the situation of the Roman town, they built one of their own at a short  distance along the coast, with the materials of the old one, and gave it a name purely Arabic, as is that of    & ye Al-meriyyah, (a word meaning the ‘ conspicuous,’ the ‘ visible,’ no doubt because of its being seen  far at sea.)   What the Arabs called ‘ the river of Bejénah” is now ‘the river of Almeria.” Higher up, and  before it receives the waters of the Andarax, it is called Rio Boloduy.

Some of them held  Almeria, Cadiz, and other cities of Spain, as a fief of the Almoravides, until, by the entire subjection  of Spain by the arms of ’Abdu-l-mimen, the first Sultan of the Almohades, they were compelled to  submit. Conde, Hist. de la Dom. vol. ii. p. 292, speaks of a certain ""Abdullah Ibn Maymun, who was  governor of Almeria in five hundred and forty (a.p. 1145); but a few pages lower (p. 298) he calls  him’ Muhamad ben Maymun. See also Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 54.   During the occupation of Almeria and Cadiz by the princes of this family the maritime forces of the  western Arabs were continually engaged in piratical incursions upon the coasts of France and Italy.

Oil, wine,  hemp, manufactured stuffs, pottery, and above all, raw silk, seem to have furnished the principal staple of  a trade which poured immense wealth all along the shores of Granada. It was from their establishments  on that coast, and chiefly at Almeria, that the Italian citizens first acquired that superiority in trade, and  that proficiency in various branches of industry, which insured to them in the fourteenth and fifteenth  centuries the universal market of Europe.

Marmol (Rebel. de los Moris. fo. 77) mentions among the villages of the Taa, or district of Berja, two  whose names bear a slight resemblance to this—Aynarid and Bena Harin.

Nothing is so difficult as to fix the topography of small towns and hamlets mentioned by the Arabian  historians and geographers. Besides their being almost universally written without vowels, and in a  variety of ways, so as to make their real pronunciation rather a matter of guess than a certainty, the  words themselves were so much vitiated by the pronunciation of the Christians that some of them scarcely  retain any of the radical letters. The conquerors, too, in settling in the Moorish towns and villages, not  anfrequently baptized their new place of residence, either by naming it after the country of their birth or  by translating the name into Spanish. For instance, when, after the conquest of Seville by St. Ferdinand  in Noy. a.p. 1248, the lands and villages about the capital were distributed among the noblemen  and feudal lords who had assisted in the undertaking, scarcely one of the allotted districts retained its  Arabian name. o> Jilién was transformed into Villalba ; bls Fordt, or Euphrates, into Tamariz ;    iy os! i> Harrat Abi Sarrah into Molina ; 5B; wae Hisn-zahrah was translated by Penaflor. I    might multiply the examples of this kind, all taken from a curious old manuscript in the Brit Mus.,  Bib. Eger. No. 478, being a copy of the original distribution made of the lands about Seville immediately  after the conquest. If to this be added that many of the towns and hamlets inhabited by the Arabs  have, owing to the persecution of the Moriscos until their final expulsion in 1610, and the frightful  decrease of population in Spain during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, totally disappeared from  the surface, the reader will easily conceive the difficulties which the translator has had to encounter at  every step to determine the modern names and situation of several places mentioned in this history.    10 wie Jayyén is believed to be the Aurigi of Pliny.

It was completed in the space of a few months, and the troops  passed for the first time over it on Tuesday, the eighth of Safar, a.1. five hundred and sixty-seven (11th  October, a.p. 1171). During the siege of Seville by Ferdinand III. (August, a.p. 1247, to November,  1248) this bridge, the boats of which were connected together by means of strong iron chains, and  defended by the garrison, opposed considerable resistance; and as the avenues to it by land were also  strongly guarded, the Moors obtained supplies from the country, and the siege was considerably pro-  tracted. However, by means of two galleys, armed with iron prows and impelled by favourable winds,  and a strong setting tide, the chains that joined together the bridge were broken asunder, and the boats  sunk.

It comes from Ws iy sharaf, with the article pretixed,    which means ‘a hilly country,’ such being the nature of the ground here alluded to. Conde was wrong  in deriving this word from al-zarafe, which he supposed meant ‘tax, tribute.’ The root from which the  Spanish words almozarife, almoxarifar, almoxarifazgo, are derived is a different one. They all come from    cee    oO > which means ‘to collect the fruits of the land, to gather the harvest ;’ and as most of the land-  taxes paid by the Spanish Arabs, and indeed all over the Mohammedan countries, were gathered in kind,  hence the collector was called 5 y Gu al-mokhdrif. As a farther proof that the word Ararafe comes    from 5 yal and means a hilly country, I can adduce the testimony of Ibnu Bashktiwaél, Ibnu-l-abbar,    and other Arabian writers, who give a similar name to a district in the neighbourhood of Cordova,  which to this day is called by the country people los Azarafes.    ‘6 ULI bl sometimes written & || Fo ‘the suburb of Triana,’ which is universally believed to owe its    name to the Emperor Trajan, who was a native of Italica.

In the distribution of lands made after the conquest of that city by Ferdinand III., it is still  mentioned under the name of Sevilla la vieja (Old Seville), or Campos de Talca. The village of Santi  Ponce now occupies part of its site, an extensive plain, which in the sixteenth century was still thickly  strewn with imposing remains, such as a beautiful amphitheatre, temples, statues, and hundreds of  standing ‘columns, &c., but which has since been almost entirely deprived of its ornaments by the  successive depredations of the inhabitants of Seville, who, like their predecessors the Moors, have  appropriated them for their buildings.   Ornamented by the gifts of three Roman Emperors born within its walls (Adrian, Trajan, and  Theodosius), Italica was raised to the first rank among the Roman cities in the Peninsula. It was a  considerable town, and the seat of a bishopric under the Goths, but was probably destroyed or deserted  by the Arabs, who employed its materials in the enlargement of Seville. The traveller Swinburne, who  visited Spain towards the middle of the last century, says that the corporation of Seville having had  occasion, some time previous to his visit to that city, for stones for the embankment of the Guadalquivir,  which by its frequent inundations caused great damages to the city, ordered the amphitheatre of Italica  to be knocked down, and many thousands were employed to batter the walls, and to blow up with  gunpowder such parts as resisted the pickaxe !—Swinburne’s Tour through Spain, London, 1740.

Its present name, Beja, is from Badjeh, a  corruption of Pace, for the Goths seem, in almost every instance, to have adopted the ablative instead of  the nominative case for the names of their towns, which names the Arabs afterwards still further cor-  rupted ; such as Assido-ne (Sidonia), Tarraco-ne (Tarragona), Barcino-ne (Barcelona), Obulco-ne (Porcuna).  Another curious instance of a similar corruption occurs in the name of Hippo Regia, corrupted into  Hippone, and afterwards transformed by the Arabs into Bone, now Bona. The city of Beja now belongs  to Portugal.    % Merida is the Emerita Augusta, a Roman municipium, built by Augustus for the use of his soldiers.

(Hist. de Don Rodrigo,  part ii. p. 311.) Diego de Urrea, another Morisco, declared it to be Guadf Anac, which he translated into  ‘narrow river ;’ but who will not say at first sight that the word Guadiana is neither more nor less than a  compound of an Arabic and a Latin word—wddi or wdda, meaning river, and Ana or Anas, the Latin  name for the river, as if we said ‘the river Ana?”    os +e  * A . aya A ve? FP  Urry Bathaliés. The name of this city, as well as the patronymic Bathaliésf, is differently    oe  written by the Arabian historians of Spain. I have often met with it written thus, le Badhliés and    pes Badhalids ; (see Idrist, ed. of Rome, 1592, elim. iv. sect. 1.) The author of the Audhahu-t-    Cress    mesdlek and Abit-l-fedé write uo path, Batalyaus.' It is supposed to be the same city as that called  ~ cs    Pax Augusta by Strabo, which name some writers pretend was corrupted by the Arabs into Bathlios  or Bathaliés, now Badajoz. I confess that this conjecture, though supported by some writers of note  (see Conde, Geog. del Nub. Mad. 1799, p. 195), seems to me rather hazardous, for although Par-Augus  or Par-Augos, with the change of P into B, might easily have produced Baxagos or Badagos, until we  find the name of that town written thus by the Arabs we cannot reasonably suppose that the uw ppl  Bathalios of the Arabs is the same as Pax Augusta. Another etymology has been assigned to the word  Badajoz by Morales, (Antig. de Espana, fo. 128,) and by the author of the small Vocabulary printed  at the end of the Spanish and Latin Dictionary by Antonio de Nebrixa. Both pronounce the word to  be Arabic, and to mean ‘land of walnuts.’ I need not state that the derivation is quite arbitrary; but  it is but just to mention here a curious coincidence, namely, that one of the gates of Cordova, in the  times of its greatest splendour, is said by Ibnu Bashkuwél (Arab. MS. in the Nat. Lib. Mad., Gg. 29)  to have been called rp wl Bab Badhalics (gate of Badajoz), and ye wb Bab jéz (gate of  the walnuts) likewise.   On the other hand much dispute has arisen among the antiquarians upon the names of Par Julia and  Paz Augusta. But there is, I believe, every reason to suppose that Par Julia and Par Augusta were two |  distinct towns in Lusitania, both mentioned by the Roman geographers, some identifying the former with  Beja, and the latter with Badajoz, and others vice versd; others again having gone so far as to suppose  that the Par Augusta of Strabo, the Par Julia of Ptolemy and Antoninus, and the Colonia Pacensis of  Pliny, were the same town. See Wesseling in his notes to the Itinerary of Antoninus, p. 407, and  Cellarius, Geog. Ant. lib. 11. cap. i. sect. 1, § 18.    2 Mohammed Ibn Moslemah, better known by the family surname of Jbn Al-afttas, was not the  founder of the kingdom of Badajoz, as here stated, nor were his name and surname as here given by the  writer. He was called Abi Bekr Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Moslemah, and surnamed Al-mudhdhafer  (the victorious). He succeeded his father, ’Abdullah Ibn Moslemah, on the throne of Badajoz, and great  part of Al-gharb (Algarve), or the western provinces of Spain, in four hundred and fifty-two (a.p. 1060-1),  or according to others two years afterwards, and ’Abdullah himself did not obtain the supreme command  till after the death of Shabir, the Persian, also King of Badajoz, whose Wizir he had been.

It rests upon six arches, of which  the two central ones are no less than ninety-four feet wide; a triumphal arch, with an inscription m  honour of Trajan, rises in the centre, and a mausoleum, constructed by the Roman architect for himself,  stands at the extremity towards the town.

Tefdhu-s-sindf, ‘the apple of Sind,’  means ‘a water melon,’ a fruit which, as is well known, grows to an enormous size in the south of    Spain.

Although  from the date assigned for the death of this Abu ’Abdillah, namely, six hundred and six (a.p. 1209-10),  on his return from his pilgrimage, he cannot be the individual heré alluded to, Al-mu’atamed, the last  King of Seville of the dynasty of Abb&d, having died in four hundred and eighty-eight (a.p. 1095), yet  the fact of both writers (Makrizi and Al-makkar{) giving the spelling of the patronymic Al-ydhizf, which  they derive from Yékiz, a hamlet in the west of Spain, induced me to substitute the reading as above.

"    372 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book I.    CHAPTER IV.    1 T have already remarked elsewhere that the Arabic word safér, i. e. copper, (in Spanish azofar,)  seems intended for the translation of the Latin word ra, meaning the era of Cesar; and I have stated  my reasons for believing that the original meaning of the word 4/ra was ‘copper money.’ Some writers,  like Masdeu (Hist. Crit. de Espana, Madrid, 1783, vol. xvi. p. 24, et passim) and Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp.  Esc. vol. i. p. 296), are of opinion that the word safar is a corruption from the Hebrew Safard,  meaning Spain among the Jews; and, therefore, that whenever that word is used by Mohammedans  it means the Spanish era; but the etymology, although ingenious, is hardly justifiable. Be this as it  may, the era of Cxsar was the general mode of computation in Spain up to the year 1383, when, in  the Cortes held at Segovia by John II. of Castile, it was abrogated, and the Christian era, then  generally followed throughout Europe, substituted for it. (See Medina, Grandezas de Espaia, Alcal4,  1566, fo. 33.) It has often been confounded with the Christian and other eras, thereby giving rise to  many anachronisms. Nicolas Antonio (Bib. Vet. vol. ii. p. 234) mistook it for the era of the  martyrs.   The word safar means also a zero, and is the origin of the words cifra, Sp., and chiffre, Fr.    2 Caesarea Augusta. The resemblance of the word Caesarea to the Arabic word kasr (in Spanish  alcazar), ‘a palace,’ no doubt gave origin to this ridiculous derivation.    8 I think I have discovered the circumstance which gave rise to this popular tradition, which I find  recorded by almost every Arabian geographer who has treated of Spain. They relate that among the  noble Arabs who came in the suite of Musa, when he invaded Spain, there was one who belonged to the  class of the tdbi’s (or followers). His name was Hansh As-sana’fni; he lived and died at Saragossa,    we  where his body is supposed to be interred. Now uae hansh means ‘a snake, a viper, any species of  venomous reptile,’ and it is probable that the Arabs, who consider as saints the as‘hdb (companions) and  the tdbi’s (followers) of their Prophet, believed that the presence of the body of this holy man was a sort  of talisman against reptiles.    we  4 Gla Jelk. According to Abii-l-késim Al-gharnétti, in his commentary on the Makssirah of Hézem    (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9579, fo. 112), this word, which he spells gis Jellek, was the  name of a place in Syria, famous for the coldness and limpidness of its waters. It was inhabited by a  tribe called the Ra> A) Bent Jafnah, who were the descendants of the Kings of Ghassén or Ghossén.   A. reads bfr (a well), B. nahr (a river); supposing the latter to be the true reading, the author means,  perhaps, the Gallego, a small river which discharges its waters into the Ebro, north of Saragossa. The  Arabs calling the Galicians gi/%o Jelalkah from Gallaici, they may also have called the river Jelek or    Jelak from Gallaicus ; it is, therefore, not improbable that the similarity of the spot, as well as that of  its name, brought to the mind of the conqueror the recollection of his native country. However, I merely    offer this as a conjecture, for, I repeat, although B. calls it a river, both A. and the epitome call it )  (a well). °",434,,

Suleyman did not, properly speaking, revolt against the Beni Umeyyah. When he took possession of  Saragossa by force of arms (four hundred and thirty-one), that city and the territories attached to it  had been for the space of twenty-six years in the hands of a rebel called Al-mundhir Ibn Yahya Ibn  Huseyn At-tojibi, who, on the usurpation of the throne of Cordova by ’Alf, the Berber (a.. four  hundred and five), shook off all allegiance, and declared himself independent in his government.    6 Lerida is sometimes written 3) », 3 and at others § J ¥) It is the ancient Nerda.

Abt-I-fedé (see Geog. fo. 47) describes it as irekw3) Bdare kyde ‘a modern  city built since the times of Islém,’ but that author was mistaken, since it is well known to be the Tutela  of the Romans. Perhaps, as in many other instances, a new city was built by the Arabs close to the  Roman, and with its materials, to which they gave the same name. Turasdénah (now Tarazona) is the  Twriaso of Pliny. Weskah (now Huesca) is the ancient Osca.   Kal’at Ayib is the modern town of Calatayud, but what the author means by Hilo Liv dey ‘and  its city (capital) is Melidnah,’ I cannot guess. Kal’at Aydb, being, as its name sufficiently implies, a  foundation of Ayib Ibn Habib Al-lakhmf, a brother-in-law of Musa Ibn Nosseyr, is generally supposed  to have been built close to the ancient Bilbilis, with the materials of the Roman city. It afterwards  became a city of some importance, and the capital, as now, of a district. An eminence, still called by  the natives Banbola, and a small river close to it known by the same name, are the only relics of the  Roman Municipium of Bilbilis Augusta, so often mentioned by the classics. See Martial, iv. 55, et  passim; Justinus, 3, 13, 44, et passim.   I know of no town in the neighbourhood of Calatayud whose present name bears any resemblance to  Melianah except Molina, which, though likewise in Aragon, is nearly thirty-four miles from Calatayud,  and too far to have formed part of its district: on the other hand, I may not be justified in reading  Molina, since this word x} Ue may equally be read Moliénah, Meliénah, Milid4nah, &c. There was in  Africa a city called Meliana, (See Al-bekri, loco laudato, fo. 61, verso ; Moura’s Karttds, p. 221; and Idrisi,  apud Hartmann, pp. 77, 117, 120, et passim.) It is the same city called Meliana by Leo, p. 516, Miliana  by Marmol, vol. ii. fo. 213, and Maniana or Maliana by Shaw. See Travels, p. 79.   dul 7? Birtdnieh. Thus written. Idrisf makes no mention of this district among those of Aragon.  1 suppose it to be some error of the copyist, but know not what to substitute.   aad, yA Barweskah admits no other interpretation than Bribiesca, the Virovesca of the ancients, and yet  this city not only does not belong to Aragon, since it always made part of Old Castile, but could never have    - 39    - 3  been comprised within the limits of Saragossa. I would rather read i 9 ye Beroshah, or <4 ya)  Boroshak, now Borja, a considerable district to the west of Saragossa. Indeed, one of the MSS. reads  op Boroshk, which sounds something like it.    7 Merwn Ibn ‘Abdillah Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz was proclaimed King of Valencia in the month of Shawwil,  a.H. five hundred and thirty-nine (March, a.p. 1145), but scarcely had he reigned two years when he  was deposed by a popular insurrection. After several adventures, differently related by the Arabian  historians, he contrived to escape to Africa, where he fixed his residence in Morocco. See Casiri,",435,,

This word, in its primitive sense, means ‘a spot paved with flags’ or made flat; hence the  Spanish word arrecife, meaning ‘a causeway.’ The Risséfah was a garden laid out in imitation of  those which ’Abdu-r-rahmén I. planted at Cordova, and which he denominated thus after similar pleasure-  grounds near Damascus. The word may be pronounced either Russdfah or Rissdfak, of both of which  instances occur in Spanish topography. Close to Valencia there is a spot to this day called Ruzdfa,  which, during the sixteenth century, was very much resorted to by the inhabitants of that city for  its pleasantness and salubrious air; and there was also, at a short distance from Cordova, a convent  called San Francisco de la Arrizafa, built, no doubt, on the site of ’Abdu-r-rahm&n’s garden.    © Saie Munyah or Minyah means ‘a garden’ or spot of recreation, and not, as Conde thought, a  fortified place (see his notes to Idrisi’s Geography, p. 154). De Sacy (Chr. Ar. vol. ii. p. 3),  Quatremére (Mémoires sur I’ Egypte, pp. 1, 196), Jaubert, in his translation of Idrisi, and other authors,  have written this word Minyah, but I have followed the former pronunciation, which was undoubtedly  that of the Spanish Arabs, as may be proved by the names of many towns and villages, still existing  in Spain, called Almunia, such as ‘Almunia de Dona Godina,’ ‘ Almunia de San Juan,’ ‘ Almunia  Madrada,’ &c.

It was already famous in the time of the  Romans for its linen manufactures, and became more so during the middle ages for its paper-mills.   Whether the Spanish Arabs had or had not the honour of introducing into Western Europe the manu-  facture and use of paper has long been a controverted point, but one, in my opinion, easily settled.  There are ir the Escurial Library several MSS. written in Spanish, as early as the tenth century, upon  cotton paper, and specimens of linen paper abound likewise in MSS. of the following age. Idrisi, who  wrote towards the middle of the twelfth century, mentions the city of Xatiba as already famous  for its manufactures of paper (clim. iv. sect. 1), and every thing tends to prove that the Arabs were  the introducers of the use and manufacture of paper into Spain. From the Spanish Arabs this useful  invention passed to their Christian neighbours, among whom paper manufactures were introduced as  early as the close of the thirteenth century by the efforts of King Alfonso X. of Castile, although  it is not uncommon to find in Spain manuscripts of still earlier date written on paper, brought, no  doubt, from the manufactures in the Moslem dominions. Of this number is one written a.p. 1178,  and which, according to Mayans (Mem. Hist.), is preserved in the royal archives of Barcelona. From  Spain the art of making paper passed successively into France, Germany, and +England. Italy was  the last of the European states to receive that beneficial art, the first manufactures ever established  in that country being those of Padua and Treviso, about the middle of the fourteenth century ;  and yet Tiraboschi, a writer who has often been swayed by a partiality for his own country, has  not hesitated to attribute the origin of linen paper manufacture to the Italian Trevigi.

Ronda was not comprised in the central, but in the western division; besides, I am not aware that  the castle or citadel commanding that town was ever called Ondak. Ronda is the ancient Arunda.    18 Wéddiu-l-abiadh or Wdda-l-abyddh, now Guadalaviar, with the final d changed into r,—a frequent  corruption in Spanish words derived from the Arabic—means ‘ the white river.’ It is the Turia of ancient  writers, to which the Arabian settlers gave a name of their own, no doubt in remembrance of a river so  called in their native land, for I find that the Syrian Arabs settled in the territory of Murcia, and Abi-  \-fed& (An. Mosl. vol. iii. p. 323) mentions a river also called Wiida-l-abyddh, close to Hamadan in Syria.   The author, however, has fallen into a strange mistake. The river which passes close to Murcia  is not the Guadalaviar, but the Segura, which presents none of the phenomena here ascribed to it.  The Guadalaviar, on the contrary, which discharges its waters into the Mediterranean close to Valencia,  is subject to periodical inundations, which fertilize the territory through which it flows.   pes Tudmfr was the Arabic name for Murcia, but this circumstance being unknown to the  generality of the Spanish writers, the most serious mistakes have been committed, both by historians    and antiquarians.

Conde (Geog. del Nub. p. 189) read Tadmor, and thought that the district round Murcia was so called -  from its being peopled by Arabs from Tadmor or Palmyra. The word Tudmér, which is to be written    oo    thus, peed is meant by the Arabian writers for the name of Theodomir, one of Roderic’s generals,  who having, at the time of the conquest of Spain by the Arabs, obliged them by his bravery and  skill to grant him favourable conditions of peace, was left in possession of the province of Murcia,  which he governed during his lifetime, and which passed afterwards into the hands of his son, Athanagild.  The dominions of this Goth were therefore called Beldd Tudmir (the country of Theodomir), the city  of Murcia (the Murgi of Pomponius Mela), or some other city contiguous to it, where he fixed his  residence, being naturally called Medinah Tudmir (the city of Theodomir), and Hadhrat-Tudmir, the  court or residence of Theodomir.   According to the author of the Audhahu-l-mesdlek (fo. 151, verso), Murcia was entirely built by the  Arabs, with the materials of a Roman city in the neighbourhood. Abi-l-fedé (Geog. fo. 47, verso) says  that this took place during the reign of the Beni Umeyyah at Cordova. See also Ibn Khallekén, at  the life of Abid Bekr Mohammed Ibnu-l-hoseyn (No. 634, Tyd.

Segura is the Tader  of Pliny, also called Terebis by Ptolemy, and Serebis (no doubt a corruption from the latter) by Mela.  It is likely that its present name is due to the Arabs, who named it after that chain of mountains where  the river was supposed to rise from the same source as the Guadalquivir.    % SoU styl in B.

(See Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. pp. 42, 134, et passim.) The  capital of his states was the city of Santa Maria, which the Arabs called ‘‘Santa Maria Ibn Razin,” to  distinguish it from another city of the same name in the western part of Spain. Hence its present name  of Albarracin. (See a previous note, p. 320, No. 38.) The district of Albarracin was likewise called  Al-kartim and Al-kardtim, owing to the abundance of kirtim (carthamus ceruleus, or bastard satfron,)  which grew on its territory. The Spaniards call it alazor from the Arabic word az-zohor (flowers).         CHAPTER V.    ' The text of all the copies reads ‘’Ali Ibn Misa Ibn Maymiin;’ but I believe that ‘Isa is to be  substituted for Miisa. (See a previous note on the Beni Maymiin, No. 124, p. 360, and the Appendix  B. at the end of this volume.) According to the author of the history of Africa entitled Karttds, the  event here recorded took place in five hundred and forty (a.p. 1145-6); his words are as follow: “In  “this year ’Ali Ibn Isa Ibn Maymiin Al-lamtumni pulled down the idol and tower of Cadiz.”    2 Al-khdliddt (the eternal). These are, to all appearance, the Canaries or Fortunate Islands of the  ancients. Ibnu-l-wardi, loco laudato, fo. 55, says that they are only two. Idrisi says six. See Geog.    elim, i. and ii.    3 I find that Ibnu-l-wardi, /oco laudato, fo. 55, attributes the erection of these towers to Dha-l-menar  Al-himyari, one of the Tabbabahs or Kings of Yemen, whom he identifies with Dhd-l-karneyn  (Alexander), not the king mentioned in the Koran, but the Greek hero.    4 As-sa’idit (the fortunate). This is a remarkable instance of the looseness of Arabic translations  made from the Greek, and the numerous errors thereby introduced into geographical works. It is  evident that by the eternal and the fortunate the same group of islands are designated, only that some  translated fortunate by Gol dle. sa’ddit, and others by Gulls khdliddét. Abt-l-feda, Ibnu Sa’id,  and other geographers, who were not aware of the mistake committed by former writers, tried to  establish a distinction between the two names by applying the first to the Canaries and the second to  the Madeira islands. Others, like Ibn Iy4s, whom Al-makkari follows, thought that sa’dddt was the",440,,

Idrisi calls them also Fortundtash, and adds that the meaning of  that word is the same as Sa’idét in Arabic. See edit. of Rome, clim. i. and ii.    The author of the Audhahu-l-mesdlek, fo. 71, verso, quoting the geographer Ibnu Su'id, says that the  ,islands called As-sa’déddt lie between the Khdliddt and the coast of Africa.    u gents Shaltis is the small peninsula formed by the confluence of the rivers Gibraleon and Tinto,  where the town of Huelva stands, about sixty miles west of Seville, for although there is an island  opposite to it called San Francisco de la Rabida, it is too small to have ever contained a city so populous  as Shaltis is represented to have been by the Arabian geographers. (See Idrisi and the writers already  quoted.) In old Spanish maps of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries this peninsula is called Saltes.  Conde, in his notes to Idrisi’s Geography, pp. 180 and 205, says that Shaltis is for Tarsis, Tartis, or Tartesia,  the country where Argantonio reigned, a fabulous King of Spain who is said to have lived one hundred and  fifty years. I need not labour to show the unsoundness of such a conjecture. The reader will find in the  work of Francis Carter, an English traveller who resided long in Spain, much that is really interesting  and curious upon the Pheenician and Greek settlements along the south-western coast of the Peninsula :  (A Journey from Gibraltar to Malaga, 8vo., London, 1772.) Ondba is now Gibraleon (Jebal-’ayin, or  ‘the mountain of the epring) ;’ Lib/ak (now Niebla) is the ancient Ilipla.    6 There are two authors known by the surname of Ibau-l-labbdnah or labbénah (the son of the milk-  maid) in Casiri’s Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. One is Abu Bekr Ebn Alabana, from Denia, (see vol. i. p. 105) ;  the other (ib. p. 128)-is also called Abu Bekr Ben Allabanat, but Cordova is said to be the place of his  birth or residence. They appear to me to be the same person, inasmuch as I find in the Kaldyidu-J-  ‘ikiydin, by Al-fat’h, (Arab. MS. in my possession,) that Jbnu-l-labbdnah resided both at Cordova and at  Denia. His entire name was Abi Bekr ‘Isa, and he was known by the surname of BOL vw!

"    372 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. (BooK I.    CHAPTER IV.    1 | have already remarked elsewhere that the Arabic word safér, i. e. copper, (in Spanish azofar,)  seems intended for the translation of the Latin word ra, meaning the era of Cesar; and I have stated  my reasons for believing that the original meaning of the word dra was ‘copper money.’ Some writers,  like Masdeu (Hist. Crit. de Espana, Madrid, 1783, vol. xvi. p. 24, et passim) and Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp.  Esc. vol. i. p. 296), are of opinion that the word safar is a corruption from the Hebrew Safard,  meaning Spain among the Jews; and, therefore, that whenever that word is used by Mohammedans  it means the Spanish era; but the etymology, although ingenious, is hardly justifiable. Be this az it  may, the era of Cesar was the general mode of computation in Spain up to the year 1383, when, in  the Cortes held at Segovia by John II. of Castile, it was abrogated, and the Christian era, then  generally followed throughout Europe, substituted for it. (See Medina, Grandezas de Espana, Alcalé,  1566, fo. 33.) It has often been confounded with the Christian and other eras, thereby giving rise to  many anachronisms. Nicolas Antonio (Bib. Vet. vol. ii. p. 234) mistook it for the era of the  martyrs.   The word safar means also a zero, and is the origin of the words cifra, Sp., and chiffre, Fr.    2 Caesarea Augusta, The resemblance of the word Caesarea to the Arabic word kasr (in Spanish  alcazar), ‘a palace,’ no doubt gave origin to this ridiculous derivation.    3 I think I have discovered the circumstance which gave rise to this popular tradition, which I find  recorded by almost every Arabian geographer who has treated of Spain. They relate that among the  noble Arabs who came in the suite of Misa, when he invaded Spain, there was one who belonged to the  class of the tdbi’s (or followers). His name was Hansh As-sana’én{; he lived and died at Saragossa,    ee  where his body is supposed to be interred. Now ui hansh means ‘a snake, a viper, any species of  venomous reptile,’ and it is probable that the Arabs, who consider as saints the as’hdb (companions) and  the ¢dbi’s (followers) of their Prophet, believed that the presence of the body of this holy man was a sort  of talisman against reptiles.    oe  “ Gla Jelk. According to Abi-]-késim Al-gharnatti, in his commentary on the Makssirak of Hazem    (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9579, fo. 112), this word, which he spells gis Jellek, was the  name of a place in Syria, famous for the coldness and limpidness of its waters. It was inhabited by a  tribe called the Sia> A) Bent Jafnah, who were the descendants of the Kings of Ghassin or Ghoss4n.   A. reads bfr (a well), B. nahr (a river); supposing the latter to be the true reading, the author means,  perhaps, the Gallego, a small river which discharges its waters into the Ebro, north of Saragossa. The  Arabs calling the Galicians 3)J» Jelalkah from Gallaici, they may also have called the river Jelek or    Jelak from Gallaicus ; it is, therefore, not improbable that the similarity of the spot, as well as that of  its name, brought to the mind of the conqueror the recollection of his native country. However, I merely    offer this as a conjecture, for, I repeat, although B. calls it a river, both A. and the epitome call it Pe  (a well). .",442,,

"    380 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book 1.    "" Kitdbu-l-’ajdyib, ‘the book of the wonders,’ is too common a title of Arabic geographies to decide  with any degree of certitude on the work to which it belongs. ‘The wonders of creation’ is one by Abi  Hamid Al-andalusi. (See Preface.) Ibn Jezz4r or Ibnu-l-jezzér is also the author of a geographical  work entitled 'Ajdyibu-l-ardh, ‘the wonders of the world,’ and H4ji Khalfah, in his Bibl. Ind. (see voc.  Jja’rdfiyyah and ’ajdyib), gives the titles of many geographical works that begin with the word ‘ajyid.  However, I am inclined to believe that the latter is the one here intended, as I find the passage said to  be borrowed from the Kitdbu-I-’ajdyib in a geographical work entitled Kitdbu-l-ja’rdfiyyah (Arab. MS. in  my possession), which I have already described in the Preface, and the author of which borrowed  considerably from Ibnu-]-jezzér.    2 This description of the dead lake of Galicia, which appears to be no other than the river Lethe of  the ancients, is likewise found word for word in the Kitdbu-l-ja’rdfiyyah. I ought to observe here that  among the ¢dbi’s (followers of the companions) of the Prophet who invaded Spain with Musa there was    ed  one named us lb Tawis (peacock). This might have given origin to this popular tradition, in the  same manner that the body of another ¢dbi’, whose name was Hansh (snake), was believed to preserve  Saragossa from venomous reptiles. See a preceding Note, p. 372, No. 3.    '3 Ibrahim Ibnu-]-késim Al-karéwi (from Cairwén), was a geographer of the fifth century of the Hijra.  I find his name mentioned often by Ibnu Khaldiin, and by the author of the Karttds.    4 Every thing tends to prove that this unnatural trade was carried to a great extent in France during  the middle ages, for the object here specified by the writer. During the repeated and savage incursions  of the Hungarians and other northern nations, such prisoners as remained in the hands of the Franks  were taken to the Spanish frontier, and there sold to the Moslems, as we learn from the testimony of  several Christian writers themselves. See Reinaud, Invasion des Sarrazins, p. 236.   Once in Spain, these northern prisoners, whom the Arabian authors designate under the collective name  of Sakdlibah, pl. of Sikidéb (Sclavonians), were educated in the Mohammedan religion, and, like the Janis-  saries of the Turkish empire, formed the principal body-guard of the Khalifs. ’Abdu-r-rahmn III. is  well known to have had several thousands of these northern barbarians, magnificently arrayed, to mount  guard in his palace, and accompany him in his hunting and military expeditions. We see them occa-  sionally playing a principal part in the affairs of Mohammedan Spain, and founding independent kingdoms,  which they transmitted to their posterity. Zohayr and Kheyrén, both Kings of Almeria, were Scla-  vonians. Wadha and Naja, the former Wizir to Hishém II., Sultén of Cordova, and the latter the  confidant and prime minister of Hasan Ibn Yahya Ibn Idris, Sultén of Ceuta and Malaga, belonged  to the same race.   The importation of slaves into Spain must at one time have been very considerable, since we are told  by Ibn Haukal and other writers that it formed a great branch of exportation, and the principal staple of  trade between Spain and other countries held by the Moslems. ‘‘ The commodities,” says that geographer  (Arab. MS. in the Bodl. Lib., No. 998, fo. 85), ‘‘ which traders generally export from Andalus and bring  “to Maghreb, Egypt, and other Mohammedan countries, are amber, saffron, gold, silver, lead, iron,  “« quicksilver, scal-skins, raw and manufactured silks, and, above all things, male and female slaves taken  “in war with the Franks and Galicians, besides Sclavonian eunuchs, who are very much esteemed.  “ These are brought from the country of the Franks, where they are castrated, and bought by Jewish  “« merchants.”   I find a similar account in another ancient geographer, named Al-belfédhori, who wrote a description",444,,

The passage may be  found at fo. 28, towards the end, in a very interesting chapter treating about the commerce between  Mohammedan Spain and Africa. The statement is likewise confirmed by Idrisi, Ibnu-l-wardi, and other  geographers, who undoubtedly borrowed it from the work of Ibn Haukal.         CHAPTER VI. ~    ! The aqueduct of Tarragona, constructed by the Romans, was repaired by the Arabs, and destined to  the purposes for which it was first erected.

Rom, de Esp.; and Laborde, Voyage Pittoresque  et Historique de I Espagne, Paris, 1807.    2 pod! ees G ‘the district of the idols... The word sanam, which I have generally translated by    ‘idol,’ is, properly speaking, a statue, but among Mohammedans, who are averse to human figures, the  word is synonymous with idol. By ‘the district of the idols’ the author no doubt means the site of the  temple of Hercules, a rock at the mouth of the river Santi Petri, which, as late as the sixteenth century,  was thickly strewn with fragments of statues, columns, and other vestiges of Phoenician and Roman  domination, the whole of which were either washed away by the sea, or used afterwards for building the  modern fortifications of Cadiz. (See Salazar, Historia de Cadiz, Cad. 1610, p. 177.) As late as 1773  some of the foundations of the temple were still visible at very low tides. See Bowles, Introduccion a la  Historia Natural de Espana, Madrid, 1775, p. 67, et seq., and Cadiz illustrada, Cad. 1690.    3 According to Salazar this aqueduct took its waters from a spring close to Xerez, called la Fuente de  Tempul. But this is hardly credible, the distance being upwards of thirty-three miles. However, there  can be no doubt that the aqueduct passed over an estuary inundated by the sea at full tide. No traces  of it are visible at the present day; but several of the connecting piers were still standing when the  above-mentioned historian (Salazar) wrote his description of Cadiz. See id. p. 127.    4 This military road, which connected Cordova with the sea shore, is still visible at intervals, and is  used by muleteers. The part close to Cadiz is called by the country people Calzada de Hercules.    I must observe that the word p> Heshar means ‘one who is still-born,’ and seems intended for    Cesar. It is, however, the first time that I meet with the name of the Roman emperor thus rendered.  Idrisi calls him > lo Jéshar (see clim. iv. sect. 2), but his usual name among the Arabs is Kayssar.    5 J have carefully collated the whole of this passage with the copy I possess of the Kitdbu-l-’ajdyib,  where the description of this tower, together with that of the aqueduct, said to have been built by a  Grecian king, named Santi Petri, occupy nearly six quarto pages.    6 My MS. says twelve, instead of four.",445,,

See the History of the Expeditions of the Northmen, by Depping, vol. i. p. 96, an excellent work, to  which I shall occasionally refer in the second volume of this translation.    4 Al-bekri (loco laudato, fo. 73, and p. 557 of the French translation) speaks of a port on the coast of  Africa called Mersa-l-majiis, as well as of a spot on the coast of Spain, close to Cape Trafalgar, where  several of their vessels were cast on shore by a storm. The same geographer (fo. 77, and p. 569 of the  French translation) says that the western extremity of the bay of Azilah was called in his time  Babu-l-majis (the gate of the Majiis), owing to some of their vessels having been there dashed  against the rocks. :    '5 There is, close to Cabra, a considerable town in the kingdom of Cordova, a large gap in the earth,  supposed by naturalists to be an extinct volcano, but to which wonderful circumstances are attached by  the inhabitants of the neighbouring country.    16 iy} I, 5) &al5 which means ‘the castle of the halting,’ from warada, ‘to halt.’ The modern name    and situation of this place are entirely unknown to me.    7 Notwithstanding the author’s objection, there seems to be some foundation for this tradition.  Major David Price, in his Chronological Retrospect of Mohammedan History, London, 1811-21, vol. i.  p- 157, mentions, on the authority of the Habeibu-s-seyr, an expedition made into Spain by the troops  of Africa in the year twenty-seven of the Hijra (a. p. 648), the result of which is said to have been the",446,,

The general who commanded the Moslems on this occasion is there  called Abdullah Rouffia, but his real name was ’Abdullah Ibn Sa’d, as may be seen in Ibn Khaldin,  the Karttds, and Al-makin, Abu-l-fed& (An. Mosl. vol. i. p. 262) likewise mentions an incursion made  by the Arabs into Spain under the Khalifate of ’Othmin Ibn ’Affén, as here stated. I find also in  Sebastianus Samalticensis (apud Flores, Espana Sagrada, vol. xiii) that during the reign of Wamba—  a period answering to the epoch here fixed—a body of Arabs landed on the coast of Spain, and committed  all sorts of depredations. (See also Cronica General, by Ambrosio Morales, Alcala, 1577, vol. iii. p. 185.)  Lastly, Isidorus Pacensis (or De Beja, as he is called by the Spaniards) not only confirms the statement,  but adds that the invasion took place at the instigation of Count Ervigius, who succeeded Wamba on  the throne of Spain. (See Isidori Pacensis Chronicon, apud Flores, vol. viii.) There is therefore every  reason to believe that some piratical incursions upon the coasts of Spain preceded the great Sa-  racen invasion. However, the author is right in condemning the notion that the expedition started from  Cairwén, since it is evident that that city was not built until the time of ’Okbah Ibn NAfi’, during  the Khalifate of Mu’awiyah. See Cardonne, Hist. de l'Afrique, vol. i. p. 31, and Conde, Hist. de  la Dom. vol. i. p. 16.   I think proper to correct here a singular mistake committed by Erpenius in his translation of Al-  makin. That author, treating of the conquests made by the Mohammedans in the year forty-six of the  Hijra, mistook Kastiliyyak, a town in Africa, for Castilla, a province in Spain, and said ‘ Muslimi Hispaniam  invadunt.’ Kastiliyyah is the name of a district and city in Africa proper. (See Al-bekri, loco laudato,  fo. 47, verso; Idrisi, Geog. clim. ii. sect. 5; Cardonne, Hist. de l Afr. vol. i. p. 119.) Quatremére, in his  French translation of Al-bekri (p. 509), read Kastinah, or Constantina, instead of Kastiliyyah.    18 Abi-l-késim Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahm4n, better known by the surname of () (5 Fy, Zl Az-zark4l, was a famous  astronomer of the fifth century of the Hijra. He is said to be the author of an hypothesis to account for  the diminution of the sun’s eccentricity which he thought had taken place since the days of Ptolemy, and  the motion of the sun’s apogee. (See Lalande, Astronomie, tom. i. pp. 120, 127.) He passes likewise as  the inventor of an instrument much used in astronomical observations during the middle ages, and called  Zarcalla, after his name. D’Herbelot (Bib. Or. voc. Zarcallah) gives to this eminent astronomer a  different name and surname. He calls him Aben Isac Ebn Iahia Annakashi Alandalousi.    9 Bdbu-l-dabbdghin (the gate of the tanners), from dabagha (to tan or prepare skins). The Spanish  word adobar, which in ancient writings is found thus, adobgar, is derived from it. Pisa, in his Descripcion  de la Imperial Ciudad de Toledo, Tol. 1617, (fo. 21, verso,) speaks of this gate, which he says was still  called by its Arabic name, ‘ Puerta de Adabaquin.’   The word which I have translated by ‘ water-clocks,’ and which in one manuscript is written thus,  oy Sal al-b{Itdn, in another yy al-bilathin, and vis) al-bitén in a third, is not to be found in  dictionaries. But from the description here given of this artifice I have not hesitated in translating  the said word as above, as there can be no doubt of its being the clepsydra, used by the Chaldzans  and the Greeks to measure time, by the flowing of water, in astronomical observations. A contrivance  of this kind was used in Europe, up to the time of Copernicus, by Tycho Brahé himself.   I find these tanks or reservoirs often mentioned by the historians of Toledo, who all give them the  same origin. (See Pisa, Descrip. de Toledo, lib. i. c. 27; Rojas, Hist. de Toledo, part 11. lib. iv.) There  are still remaining, at a short distance from Toledo, and in the very spot here marked, on the right bank  of the Tagus, the ruins of a building, called by some Las Casas de la Reina (the pleasure-gardens of",447,,
"    384 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [BOOK 1.    the Queen), and by others Los Palacios de Galiana (the palace of Galiana), where two tanks similar to  those here described are still visible. Tradition has ascribed their building to a fabulous King of Toledo,  named Galafre, who is supposed to have been a contemporary with Abdu-r-rahm4n I., Sultén of Cordova,  whose tributary he was. This Galafre, we are told, wishing to shake off the allegiance due to his eove-  reign, invited Charles Martel, others say Pepin, King of France, and Fruela, King of Asturias, to visit  his dominions, and join him in an expedition against ’Abdu-r-rahm4n; upon which the Christian kings,  mustering their armies, traversed Spain without the least resistance on the part of the Moslems, and  arrived at Toledo. While they were there, being splendidly entertained by their guest, Pepin is said to  have fallen desperately in love with Galiana, the daughter of Galafre ; and, after killing in single combat  Bradamante, King of Guadalajara, who pretended likewise to the hand of the princess, to have espoused her  with the consent of her father, who built them a sumptuous palace outside the walls of his capital. The  adventures of Pepin, Galiana, and her father Galafre, form the subject of many a popular Spanish ballad,  whence they were borrowed and improved upon by Ariosto. See Pisa, Descripcion de Toledo, fo. 27,  verso; Rojas, Hist. de Toledo, p. 585 ; and Marmol, Hist. de Africa, vol. i. fo. 95.   I need not remark that the above account is wholly fabulous; Spain was not invaded either by Charles  Martel or by Pepin, but by Charlemagne, who ravaged the northern provinces only, and did not cross the  Ebro. There was no independent kingdom of Toledo at the time; the sons of Yusuf Al-fehri, who  rebelled against ’Abdu-r-rahm4n, and obtained a temporary possession of that city,—and one of whom  has been identified with Galafre——had names too dissimilar to render the corruption at all probable, one  being called Mohammed, the other Késim. And yet this fable has been countenanced by the best  historians of Spain! See Marmol, Hist. de Africa, vol. i. fo. 95, et seg.; Garibay, Hist. de Espana,  lib, xxxvii. c. 15; Morales, Cronica General, lib. xiii. c. 20.   As to the palace here described, it was a pleasure-house belonging to the kings of Toledo, of the family  of Dhi-n-nin, and probably the same which, in another part of this work (see p. 239), is said to have  been built by Al-m4min Ibn Dhi-n-nin, who filled the throne of that city until four hundred and  sixty-nine (a.p. 1076-7). After the taking of Toledo by Alfonso, the royal house, together with  the adjoining gardens and lands, was given in the division to the city. It is now converted into  a farm-house, the walls of which are still covered with Arabesque tracings of the most exquisite  designs. I visited it in 1836, and found in the yard adjoining to it the two tanks here alluded  to still visible, notwithstanding the heaps of rubbish which have been accumulating for centuries.  There is also a subterranean vault leading from the house to the river, and some years ago a large  quantity of leaden pipes, communicating with the tanks, were dug up by the present tenants of the  farm-house.   As stated above, it is probable that these clepsydra were built for the purpose of astronomical  observations. Al-mamiin Ibn Dhi-n-ntin, King of Toledo, is reported, both by the Arabian and Christian  chroniclers, to have been a monarch much addicted to science, which he fostered and promoted in his  states by inviting to his capital the learned of other countries. He seems to have bestowed all his  care and attention upon the revival of the mathematical sciences, which, since the overthrow of the  Cordovan Khalifate, had nearly been extinguished in Spain by the fanaticism and ignorance of the  African conquerors. See the Appendix C. at the end of this volume. Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii.  pp. 45, 214, et passim. Conde, Hist. de la Dom. vol. ii. pp. 46, 56, et passim.

There is in the National Library at Madrid a manuscript marked L. 97, containing various treatises on  astronomy and mathematics, translated from Arabic into Spanish for the use of Alfonso X., King of  Toledo, the celebrated author of the Alfonsine tables. Among them is one containing the following  treatises :   Fo. 175. Modo de usar un instrumento que compuso Ali, hijo de Jalaf, para el Rey Maimon, dividido en  cinco partes.

Alfonso VI., the conqueror of Toledo, reigned from  a.D. 1065to 1109. The date (a. p. 1133-4) can therefore only be applied to Alfonso VIII., whose reign    lasted from a. pv. 1126 to 1157.

' The first Sultan of the Almoravides, also called Al-mulaththamin (i. e. the people of the veil), because  they hid the lower part of their faces with a triangular piece of cloth, called /atham, belonged to the tribe  of Masifah, one of the five divisions, according to Ibnu Khaldun, of the great Senh4jah family. They  inhabited the deserts bordering upon Stidén or Nigritia, where the traveller Ibn Battdttah found them  still in the eighth century of the Hijra. Prof. Lee, who was not aware of this circumstance, read  every where in his MSS. x3 po Us! instead of a ~~ Ux»! thereby translating that expression by  ‘merchants,’ instead of ‘the people of Mastifah.’ See The Travels of Ibn Batuta, London, 1829, p. 233.   This comparison of Spain to a bird is much in the taste of the Arabs. Some of their geographers have  compared the world to an eagle, making China and India the head; Turkey and Tartary the right wing,  and the territories of Gog and Magog the left; Syria, Asia Minor, and Hejéz, the breast; Western  Europe and Africa the tail. See the Kitdbu-l-bolddn, by Al-belédhori, (Ar. MS. in the Brit. Mus.,  No. 7496, fo. 2.)   Conde inserted the above anecdote in the second volume of his Hist. de la Dom. p. 187, but he  evidently misunderstood the text of the Arabian historian from whom he borrowed it. He likewise read  Musafah instead of Masitfah, and called ’Alf ‘ prince of the believers,’ instead of ‘ prince of the Moslems,’  which is quite a different thing. (See ib. p. 99.) I may observe here that the Spanish translator  did not always pay sufficient attention to the titles of Amiru-/-mimenin and Amiru-l-moslemfn, assumed. by  the princes of the various dynasties that ruled over Spain and Africa, often mistaking one for the other,  and making no distinction whatever between the two. It does not appear from history that Yusuf Ibn  Téshfin, or any of his successors, ever took the title of Amtru-l-mumentn, which was reserved for the  Khalif or Vicar of the Prophet in the East; they seem, on the contrary, to have contented themselves  with the more modest title of Amtru-/-moslemin, ‘prince of the Moslems’ (of Africa and Spain). The  Sult4ns of Cordova themselves, though descended from the stock of the Beni Umeyyah, and so closely  allied to the family of the Prophet, dared not assume that honorific title until the family of ""Abbas had  nearly been extirpated in Asia by the Turks; even then the assumption was considered sacrilegious by  some of the theologians in Cordova and other great cities of the Peninsula.    2 See a preceding note (p. 309, No. 1). It is to be regretted that the work from which these extracts  are taken is not known in Europe. To judge from the contents of this and the following chapter, which  are mostly borrowed from it, our information on the state of manners and society, the civil and military  regulations, the productions of the soil, and the extent of the revenue, of Mohammedan Spain, might have  been considerably increased by the judicious remarks of a writer such as Ibnu Sa’id.    3 Tbnu-l-himarah, literally ‘ the son of the she-ass.’ The name of this Wizir is Abi-l-huseyn ’Ali.

Ds it  Although the number of towns and villages said to have once lined the banks of the Guadalquivir is  evidently much exaggerated, there can be no doubt that it must have been considerable, if we consider  the fertility of the land which the Arabs occupied, their superior abilities in all the operations of  husbandry, and, above all, the continual influx of population, either from Africa, or from the districts  gradually reduced by the Christians.   The Frenchman, Cardonne, was, I think, the first who borrowed this statement from the Arabian  writers. (Hist. de [ Afrique, tom. i. p. 338.) Incredible as it is, it has been blindly adopted by Viardot,  Chenier, Aschbach, Dunham, and other European writers. Conde, who borrowed it from another writer,  says that twelve thousand hamlets, farms, and castles, were scattered over the regions watered by the  Guadalquivir. A modern writer, who to a most exquisite erudition unites a singular criticism,—I mean  the author of the History of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain,—has lately remarked that ‘the length of  “the Guadalquivir, not exceeding three hundred miles, would scarcely afford room for the same number  “ of farm-houses.”” The observation is correct, but the text here admits of no other interpretation ;  it can only be said to be one of the many exaggerations of which Arabian writers, especially geographers,  are so often guilty. Ibnu-l-wardi (Ar. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9590, fo. 13, verso) says that the  district of Seville, now called Azarafe, which has been described elsewhere, (see pp. 56, 58, and  Note 5, p. 363,) contained eight thousand towns, villages, and farms. But what shall we say when we  find the Spanish writers themselves dealing in the same coin, and tellmg us that the same district  contained twenty thousand! See Caro, Antig. de Sevilla, fo. 219; Cronica General del Rey Don Alonso ;  and Botero, Relaciones universales del mundo, Valladolid, 1603.    6 The sugar cane is one of the plants for the introduction of which Spain is indebted to the Arabs.  (See Banqueri, Agricultura, vol. i. p. 392.) It is still cultivated at Motril, Nerja, and other places along the    coast of Granada. The word yo sukkar, whence the Latin saccharum is derived, has passed into the  Spanish azucar, and found its way into every language of Europe. It comes no doubt from x shakar,  a Persian word, unless it be from the Hebrew “\3W ‘an inebriating liquor distilled from the sugar cane.’   The fruit I have translated by ‘ banana’ is jy in Spanish moz, mussa, or mossa, the Indian    plantain, or musa sapientium. It was extensively cultivated in Spain. See Banqueri, loco laudato, vol. i.  p. 394, and Idris{, apvd Hartmann, p. 74.    7 Safari. There is a species of pomegranate which the Spaniards to this day call Granada cafart.  Tbau-1l-awam, in his treatise on agriculture, (Mad. 1802, vol. i. p. 273,) gives two reasons why it received  that epithet ; first, because it was first introduced into Malaga and Granada by a man named Safar, who  procured the pip from the royal gardens at Cordova ; and secondly, because the first pomegranate came from  Syria, and was called (¢ paw safart, ‘the traveller.’ Cavarrubias was therefore wrong in supposing that  the word ¢afar{ meant a thing from Africa or Algiers. (See Tesoro de la lengua Castellana, vol. i. p. 178.)

On the other hand, there is hardly an Arabian geographer among those who have  described Spain who has not directly or indirectly treated of the tofdl or tafal, which was to be procured  at Toledo, and which all describe as a sort of eatable clay, very much used in medicine. The author  of the ’Ajdyibu-l-makhlikdt, fo. 26, says, treating about Toledo, “close to this city is a very fine town  “called pie Makédm, the soil of which is a species of clay which people eat, and which is considered as  “one of the most precious specifics on the whole earth.

For these reasons I am inclined to believe that tafal or tofdl means that sort of earth known among  the Greek physicians by the name of terra sigillata or terra Lemnia, and which Galen describes at  length.

Ad-demiri,  in his Hayydtu-l-haywdn (Arab. MS. in my possession), describes it in the following terms. ‘‘ The wabr  “is a small quadruped of the feline species, of an ashy colour, has no tail, and builds habitations  “to live in. Such are the words of Jeuhari, but by that expression (he has no tail) the author  “ undoubtedly meant that its tail was small; for it has one, although short, and exceedingly fat, like  “ that of our young lambs. The wabr is likewise called by the vulgar ghanam beni Isrdyil (the sheep of  “the sons of Israel); it resembles in many respects the hare, for, like that animal, it feeds upon plants  “and vegetables, owing to which its flesh is a delicious food.” As far as this goes the beaver is meant,  but, on the other hand, Ibnu-l-beyttar (Arab. MS. in my possession) says that it is a quadruped larger  than a dog, and living mostly in the sea, although it now and then comes on shore.    4! A jacket made of sheep-skin is still called in Spain zamarra, a word which bears a strong resemblance to    ae sammir, meaning in Arabic ‘a weasel’ or ‘a marten,’ and also the skin of that animal, but which,  according to Ad-demiri, is a synonyme for the jendu-bddastar or beaver. Ibn Haukal, in his Geography,  speaks of these sammuir as being found at Toledo. Sir William Ouseley translated that word by ‘sables or  martens.’ See Ibn Haukal’s Oriental Geography, p. 27.    © The life of this physician occurs in Ibn Abi Ossaybi’ah (Ar. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 7340, fo.  139, verso). His entire name was Abti Bekr y+ Hamid (not Hamid, as in Al-makkar{) wore"" wy!  Ton Samjin: he was an excellent physician, and had great knowledge of all the simples employed in  medicine. ‘ His treatise on simple medicaments,” says Ibn Abi Ossaybi’ah, ‘‘ is considered to be a most  “elaborate and useful performance, since he not only described all the simples known before his time,  “and collected whatever information the ancients had given on them, but added much of his own.

The word wabr  (seal or otter) is again used here, although it is evident that the beaver is‘ meant. Whatever Al-  makkari’s accomplishments as a historian may be, it is evident that he was no naturalist, or else he  would not have confounded, as he has done here, the seal, the otter, and the beaver.    “| This quadruped is described by Ad-demiri in the following words. ‘ The jendu-bddastar is an  “ animal resembling the dog, but not the sea-dog. It is only to be met with in the country of pares  « An-nakhaf! and its environs. It is also called pos kandar and ~~ sammir, and resembles in  “shape a fox. Its colour is red; it has neither hands nor feet, but its head resembles that of a man,  “ having a round face. It crawls like a reptile, and has four genitals, two inside and two out, from  «« which the remedy called jendu-bidastar (castoreum) is extracted.   This is no doubt the beaver, whose inguinal gland, known under the name of castoreum to the ancients,  was until very lately considered a specific in many diseases. According to Strabo (lib. iii.) Spain  abounded at one time in beavers, which produced castoreum, although inferior to that of Pontus. They  are not now found. ‘The beaver lives on the banks of rivers and lakes, but not in salt water, as  here expressed. The whole of this passage, indeed, is a tissue of error and contradiction. Ad-demiri  himself, who, as I have already observed elsewhere, wrote a Zoological Dictionary, entitled v! ps! Ble  (Ar. MS. in my possession), did very little else than collect together, and dispose in alphabetical order,  all the absurd and superstitious notions, all the traditions, and all the wonderful accounts he could meet  with in the writings of his countrymen, together with some indigested learning borrowed from the    Greek writers.    4 The word which I have translated by ‘sashes’ is (251% (4 shéshdt, which, according to the Kitdbu-I-    mughrib fi-l-loghat (a MS.

In Spain, where they are very much worn by the peasantry, they are called fara, from the Latin fascia.    bed es Tentali. (See p. 69.) Another MS. reads os BS Tentdli, from Tentélah.

At  Albacete, especially, there are several manufactures of well-tempered scissors, daggers, and knives, which  are reckoned the best of their kind in Spain, and which, by the shape and ornament of their blades  and handles, betray their Moorish origin. Since the expulsion of the Moriscos the Spaniards have kept  up this manufacture, but with so little variation and improvement that it is not uncommon to meet  with daggers and knives manufactured at Albacete as late as the end of the last century, still bearing  Arabic inscriptions and verses from the Korén, rudely burnt into the blade. I cannot account for this  very curious circumstance otherwise than by supposing the Spanish manufacturer to have copied and  reproduced the old models, either out of superstitious reverence, or more probably believing them to be  ornamental designs, and forming as it were an inherent part of the article.

At the time when Ibn Haukal visited Spain the throne of Cordova was occupied by ’Abdu-r-rahmén  An-néssir lidin-illah, under whose able administration the affairs of the Spanish Moslems were as pros-  perous as ever; and although the Galicians and Leonese on one side, and the Navarrese and Catalonians  on the other, repeatedly assailed his territory, they were unable, during the whole length of his reign, to  detach a single foot of land from his dominions.    s Ke Goad ye GR on 5 JL YL    © Tbnu Sa’id, writing in the seventh century of the Hijra, or thirteenth of our era, must have been  contemporary with the principal events of the wars of the Crusades.",458,,

We might also suspect  an allusion to Ibn Mardanish (see Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp.

Two years afterwards Ibnu-l-ahmar, (a. p. 1234,) having  entered that city peaceably under the pretence of giving him his daughter in marriage, and assisting him  in his rebellion against Ibn Hid, whose sworn enemy he was, slew Al-béji, and took possession of the  city. This Abi Merwén Al-b4ji, whose name was Ahmed, must, however, not be confounded with the  theologian mentioned at p. v. of the Appendix A., who had his same names and surnames.    2% When Ibnu Sa’id wrote, (a.#. six hundred and sixty,) Mohammed Ibnu-l-ahmar, the founder of the  kimgdom of Granada, reigned without a competitor over the whole of Mohammedan Spain.    % The author does not mean that the post of Wizir became hereditary in families, for this was  never the case in Spain, although instances of it were not uncommon in the East, but that the title  of Wizir was often conferred on several members of the same family, so as to render that dignity  almost an inheritance in certain noble families who had influence at court. But it ought to be  observed that the Wizirate, under the Khalifs of the house of Umeyyah in Spain, was more an  honorary title than an office, for, as the author himself explains a few lines lower down, the Wizirs  were officers who had entrance into the council-room, a sort of councillors who took part in the delibera-  tions, but who had no share whatever in the administration. The Wizirate appears to have been  an honour conferred by the Mohammedan princes on all those who, either from the nature of their  duties, or the favour in which they were held, had often occasion to enter the room in which the  monarch sat. So it was that the chief physicians of the Almoravide and Almohade Sulténs were  generally invested with that dignity. (See the lives of Ibn Roshd, Ibn Zohr, &c. in the Appendix A.)

I presume  that originally there was an epithet affixed to ashghdl, perhaps i Luu Aasbdniyyah, a word which  means any thing connected with the keeping of accounts or the collection of taxes, and that in time the    adjective was suppressed to make the appellation shorter.

The captain of this body-guard was named Sdhibu-sh-shortah. The office is very ancient, and existed  among the first Khalifs after Mohammed.

The inspection of public works was also occasionally given to him, and it is not uncommon to  see the name of the Schibu-sh-shortah commemorated on inscriptions; for instance, in one existing at  Ezija, on an aqueduct built in the year three hundred and sixty-seven, under Hishém II., Ahmed Ibn  *Abdillah Ibn Miisa is said to have been the Sdhibu-sh-shortah under whose inspection the work was  erected.

Strange to say, this  office is still in existence in Spain,—especially in the southern and eastern provinces, where the Arabs  and Moors made a longer stay,—and, what is still more extraordinary, the officer charged with it  exercises the very same functions here described. It is now called Fiel Almotazen de pesos y medidas (i.e.  officer having care of the weights and measures).    ® The sale of bread, meat, oil, and most of the articles of food, is till subject in Spain to the  inspection of government, which fixes, by means of its delegates, the prices at which they are to be sold.  The office of Mohtesidb exists at present in Turkey, and its holder is called Mohtesib Agd. Its duties  consist in inspecting the shops of the city, and punishing all defaulters, according to the quality of  the offence, either with imprisonment and torture, or by covering their heads with the entrails of  beasts, or nailing their ears and noses to a plank, &c.

As'hab-arbd’, or vu! wiles!    As‘hdbu-l-arbu’, 1 have been unable to ascertain. I have, it is true, met once or twice in Al-jera’i’s history  of Damascus with an allusion to these watchmen, but nowhere is the origin or the meaning of the name  given to their office explained. In the absence of any positive fact I may, perhaps, be allowed to hazard    a conjecture. The word = | arbu’ is the plural of ew rab’x, which means ‘a house’ or habitation of  any kind; and it is not improbable that these watchmen had small watch-houses or sentry-boxes  appropriated for their use, whence they might sally at night to make their rounds, or whenever their  presence was required in any quarter of the city. Hence these people in the East might have been called,  according to the genius of the Arabic language, ‘the people or the masters of the watch-houses,’ in the  same manner as they were styled in Spain ‘the gate-keepers,’ because of their taking care of the various  gates or wards which connected the different quarters of Mohammedan cities one with another in the  day time, and separated them at night,—a custom since observed in Spain, where Cordova, Seville,  Granada, and other Moorish capitals, preserve to this day evident traces of this internal division.    % blu) wl Kdyidu-l-asdeil, (the commander of the fleet.)

Casiri, who did not understand the meaning of    the word Ae Fi) rabadhi, read instead ws Fi ar-radht, which means ‘the benevolent or the mild,’  thus giving Al-hakem an epithet which his tyranny and cruel disposition belie, and which is in direct  contradiction to the nickname given him by his oppressed subjects, Po x!

It is, therefore, quite absurd to suppose that he could ever make so  low a computation respecting those of Spain, a country which far outstripped Africa in point of resources  and civilisation.   gle j zakah (in Spanish azague) means, properly speaking, ‘that part of his property which every  true believer offers to God.’ The only legal tax to which a Moslem was by law subjected was the  & Xo sadakah (alms).

In a toll levied on goods imported and exported,  amounting generally to a duty of two and a half per cent. on the value of the merchandize. Ornaments  of gold, silver, and precious stones were exempt by law from the payment of tithe, if used in swords,  spears, and other weapons, horse furniture, books, or the bracelets and rings worn by women on their  wedding ; all other property was subjected to the payment of the tithe.    ods = 3 9} al-ausatt, meaning ‘the middle one,’ is the epithet under which ’Abdu-r-rahman II., son of  Al-hakem I., fourth Sultan of Cordova, is generally designated.  -~    “ My copy of Ibn Khallekén estimates the revenues of ’Abdu-r-rahman III. at fifteen millions (not  five, as here stated,) four hundred and eighty thousand dinérs. It may be a mistake of the copyist, for all  the copies of Al-makkari consulted by me read distinctly five millions. If we calculate the dinér at  about ten shillings of English money, this branch only of the revenue will be found to amount to nearly  three millions sterling, an enormous sum of money for the times.    © As Ibnu Khaldin observes, the splendour with which the Khalifs surrounded their court, the  necessity of keeping considerable armies on foot to resist the attacks of the Christians, the creation of a  navy, and other exigences of the state, rendered it necessary for the Sulténs of Cordova to tax their  Moslem subjects beyond the limits marked by their religious code. New contributions were established,  and, notwithstanding the remonstrances of a few strict theologians who inveighed bitterly against this  open violation of the text of the law, whenever the capitation tax imposed on Christians and Jews was  found insufficient to cover the public expenses and to maintain the costly household of the Khalifs, the  Moslems were oppressed and taxed either by direct taxation or by duties imposed upon the sale of articles  of food. These illegal modes of raising money were comprised under the general denomination of  oksbundl al-mostkhaldss, a word meaning ‘ illegal exaction,’ or 4 b> jabdyd, ‘tribute.’   In a chapter of his Historical Prolegomena (Arab.

' Abd ’Amru ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn ’Amru Ibn Mohammed Al-auzé’ef was born in Ba’lbek in the year  eighty-eight of the Hijra (a. p. 706-7), others say in ninety-three (a. p. 711-2). He was deeply versed  in traditions, which he held from the mouth of the most illustrious among the companions of the Prophet,  and his doctrines were generally followed in Syria, whence they were introduced into Spain by the Arabs  of Damascus, continuing in full vigour until, as stated here, they were superseded by those of Mélik Ibn  Ans. Al-auzé’ei died, according to Ibn Khallekén, on a Sunday, the 29th of Safar of the year one  hundred and fifty-seven of the Hijra (Jan. a.p. 774); or, according to other authorities, in the month  of Rabi’ 1.

He says, under the year  one hundred and seventy-one of the Hijra, fo. 251, verso, “in this year died ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn  “ Mu’awiyah Ad-dakhel, King of Andalus, who introduced into his dominions the sect of Malik Ibn Ans,  “for before his time the Andalusians followed that of Al-auz4’ei. The cause which induced ’Abdu-r-  “« rahmén to take this determination is thus related by Ibnu-l-’askér. They say that Mélik once asked an  “ Andalusian doctor what were 'Abdu-r-rahmén’s habits and mode of living, and that the doctor  “‘ answered him, ‘ ’Abdu-r-rahm4n wears woollen cloth, eats tye-bread, and fights for the cause of God ;’  “and that he then began to enumerate his other good qualities, upon which M4lik was so much pleased  “ that he exclaimed, 4 Wo > oy w! ‘May the Almighty God ornament our harem with him!’ (make  “him one of our sect ;) and that when this wish of Mélik was communicated to ’Abdu-r-rahmén, he  “ expressed great satisfaction, and ordered that the religious opinions of Mélik should be admitted and  “observed throughout his dominions, whence they afterwards spread into Africa, Sicily, and other  ** countries conquered by the Moslems.”   However, notwithstanding what this author says, I do not think it probable that the sect of Mélik Ibn  Ans was introduced and followed in Spain before the reign of Hishém I., the son and successor of  *Abdu-r-rahmén. Mélik Ibn Ans was contemporary with ’Abdu-r-rahmén I., whose death, according to  Tbn Shihnah (Arab. MS. in Dr. Lee’s collection), happened eight years after that of that theologian.

D. 912), and died in three hundred and fifty (a. p. 961).    3 The entire name of this geographer is Abi-l-késim Ibn Haukal An-nassibi. We have an English  translation of his work made from the Persian by Sir William Ouseley, and published in 1800. But  the Persian being only a version of an epitome, and the readings being particularly defective, it becomes  indispensable that the original work (copies of which exist in the Bodleian and in the Royal Library at  Paris) should be translated and illustrated with notes.    4 The unfavourable opinion expressed here by Ibn Haukal was evidently caused by the animosity which  all Eastern writers seem to have borne towards Spain, owing to her separation from the mother country.  At the time when Ibn Haukal visited Spain the throne of Cordova was occupied by ’Abdu-r-rahm4n  An-nissir lidin-illah, under whose able administration the affairs of the Spanish Moslems were as pros-  perous as ever; and although the Galicians and Leonese on one side, and the Navarrese and Catalonians  on the other, repeatedly assailed his territory, they were unable, during the whole length of his reign, to  detach a single foot of land from his dominions.    : MeL!

Of the first two some account has already been given (p. 343, Notes 54 and  55). The third was called Zeyéd Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Ibn Zeyéd Al-lakhm{, better known by the  surname of oo got Shabatin. He is said, in another part of this work (fo. 100, verso), to have been  the first theologian who introduced into Andalus the sect of Malik Ibn Ans. A more ample notice of  these doctors will be given in the course of this translation.    4 The § i) ye darwdzah, from daraza, ‘to patch,’ or perhaps from the Persian Uy? duriish, ‘a piece  of cloth,’ is a sort of garment generally worn by faquirs and derwishes in the East.    5 Ar-ré’ii, whose entire name was Abi ‘Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Isma’fl, and who received in the East  the honourable surname of Shemsu-d-dfn (sun of religion), was born in Granada in the year seven  hundred and eighty-two (a.p. 1380-1), or thereabout. He quitted his native country for the East when  still young, and arrived in Cairo in eight hundred and twenty (a.p. 1417-8). He wrote several works  on rhetoric and grammar, which were very much commended and admired by the learned of his time.  According to Al-makkari, who gives his life, he died in eight hundred and fifty-three (a.p. 1449-50), at  his dwelling in that quarter of the city of Cairo called das Lall As-sdlehiyyah. The same writer (book  vi. part i. fo. 200) attributes to this Ar-ré’ii several works on various topics, and among others the  work here alluded to, paul all gizile ur AP pis el ww WS—Casiri calls him Mohamad  Ben Mohamad Alansari ; (see vol. i. p. 37.) He wrote also a commentary on the grammatical work    entitled Ajrimiyyah, of which there is in the Esc. Lib., No. 161, a copy made in the lifetime of the  author. The text of this work was published at Rome in 1592.    * The name of this individual, who is said to have been K&di-l-kodé of Granada, is not correctly given  by Al-makkari, He was called Abd-l-késim Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibn Mohammed Ibn Mohammed  Tbn ’Abdillah Al-hasani As-sebti. His life, together with that of his two sons, Abii-l-ma’ali and Abi-l-  ’abbés, occurs in my manuscript of Ibnu-l-khattfb, whose preceptor he was. That author places his birth  in six hundred and ninety-seven (a.p. 1297-8), and his death in seven hundred and sixty (a.p. 1358-9),    although it is there remarked that gietnill Al-kasmitant’, in his work entitled ‘ obituary of illustrious    men,’ places this event one year later. Haji Khalfah (voc. Maksstrak) followed the former statement.  See also Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 300.  7 ree ie Khazrajiyeh, or more correctly Khazrajiyyah, is the title of a poem so named after its author,  Dhiy4u-d-din Abii Mohammed ’Abdullah Ibn Mohammed Al-khazrajf Al-méliki Al-andalusi. Haji  Khalfah (voc. Kassidah) gives the title of this poem, as well as those of three commentaries upon it,  but that of Abu-l-k4sim, quoted by Al-makkari, was unknown to the Arabian bibliographer. A copy  of the Khazrajiyyah, with a very full and learned commentary by Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Abi  Bekr Ibn Omar Al-makhzim{, is in the Esc. Lib., No. 408. The subject of this poem, which I  find also mentioned by Khayr Ibn Khalifah in his Bibliographical Repertory (Ar. MS. in the Esc. Lib.,  No. 1667), is the rules of prosody.   The § jytive Makssiirah is also the title of a poem by Abii-l-hasan Hézem Ibn Mohammed Iba  Hasan Ibn Hézem Al-anséri Al-kartajéni, of Carthagena. There are in the Escurial Library two copies of  this poem, marked 380 and 452. They have, however, been badly described by Casiri, who strangely",470,,
"    cHaP. 1.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 405    mistook their contents. He says (see Cat. vol. i. p. 132) that No. 452 is a poem in praise of Abu  Temim Al-mustanser-billah, Sultén of Egypt, to whom the work was dedicated by that poet, without  considering that only a few pages before (id. p. 112) he describes the very same work (No. 380) as having  been dedicated by its author to Abi ’Abdillah Al-mustanser-billah, Sultan of Africa and Spain, who lived  nearly two centuries after. It happens that in the introduction or preface to the work the former of  those sovereigns, who reigned in Egypt from a.#. 427 to 487, is incidentally mentioned by the com-  mentator; but the late Librarian of the Escurial, who, as I shall have more than one opportunity of  showing in the course of these notes, was not too scrupulous in his descriptions of works and authors,  did not hesitate to pronounce the work to be dedicated by its author to a sovereign who preceded him by  two hundred years. The fact is that the poem was written in praise of, and dedicated to, Abi ’Abdillah  Mohammed. Al-hafsi, surnamed Al-mustanser-billah, Sultén of Africa, son of Abi Zakariyyé Yahya Ibn  Abi Mohammed ’Abdi-l-wéhed Ibn Ab{ Hafs, who reigned from a.#. 647 to 675.   A very handsome and carefully written copy of this commentary on the Makssirah (so called from the  fact of all its verses ending in a short elif) exists in the Library of the British Museum, marked 9579.  It is bound together with the Kaldyidu-l-’ikiydn by Al-fat'h, with the Lémiyyatu-I-’arab, and with a short  poem by the Wiz{r Lisénu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattfb, the celebrated Granadian writer whose life forms the  subject of the book from which the present is a translation, the whole being transcribed in a very neat  Maghrebi hand, in the month of Ramadhan, a.a. 1122, corresponding to February, 1710, of our era,  by Ahmed Ibnu-I-hasan Ibn Mohammed Al-warshén Al-mekidi Al-fasi.   I ought to observe that the expression ‘the people of this world and of the world to come” is of  frequent use among Mohammedans, who by the former term mean all those who, practising the duties  of religion, find, nevertheless, a pleasure in enjoying the comforts of life, while they apply the latter to men  of austere habits, who lead a life of penance and privation in the hope of deserving the rewards promised  in future life.    8 Os y= ray 9) iF This was, according to Ibnu-1-khattib, a convent or religious house in the neigh~    bourhood of Granada. Monastic institutions were frequent among the Spanish Moslems, especially in  later times, and, with a few exceptions, their rules and interior arrangement were similar to those  of the religious orders of Christendom. I translate here, from a manuscript in my possession, an  account of one of these religious communities near Malaga, as described by an African traveller  who visited Spain in the fourteenth century of our era. ‘I saw on a mountain close to this city    “ (Malaga) a & | j convent, which was the residence of several religious men living in community, and    __  “ subject to certain rules which I shall now specify. They are generally men of piety and learning, fully  “conversant with the principles of Sifism; they have a superior to preside over them, and one or more  “‘ servants to attend to their wants. Their internal regulations are really admirable; each faquir lives  “ separately in a cell of his own, and meets his comrades only at meals, or prayers, &c. Every morning  “at day-break the servants of the community go round to each faquir, and inquire of him what provi-  “sions he wishes to have for his daily consumption ; these are procured and dressed, and then each faquir  “goes down imto a refectory, where he is provided with a loaf and some food in a dish, to every man  “ his ration, so that two may not eat out of the same plate: they are served in this way with two meals a  “day. Their dress consists of a coarse woollen frock, two being allowed yearly to each man, one for  “winter, another for summer. Each faquir is furnished, likewise, with a regular allowance of sugar, soap  “to wash his clothes, oil for his lamp, and a small sum of money to attend the bath, all these articles  “being distributed to them every Friday. They are, likewise, provided from the funds of the establich-",471,,

These live with their wives in a separate  ‘part of the building, but are subject to the same rule, which consists in attending the five daily  “« prayers, sleeping at the convent, and meeting together in a lofty vaulted chamber, where they perform  “« certain devotions, each of them squatting on a mat in the spot allotted to him. For instance, in the  “morning each faquir takes his Korén, and reads the first chapter, then that of the king; and when  ‘the reading is over, a Koran, previously divided into (Aizbah) sections, is brought in for each man  “to read in turn until the lecture of the whole is completed. After this, they converse together on  “the subject of their lecture, and finish by reading the Koran in the eastern fashion. On Fridays and  “‘ other festivals these faquirs are obliged to go to the mosque in a body, preceded by their superior.  “The servants of the convent go early in the morning and take the kneeling-mats of the community,  ‘‘ which they place in a particular spot of the mosque, one by the side of the other, so that when their  “ owners arrive they may find them all ready. After the service is over, and the people gone, the faquirs  “« stay for a while reading the Kor4n in the manner above described, and return to the convent, preceded,  “as before, by their superior. They are often visited by guests, whom they entertain for a length of  “ time, supplying them with food and other necessaries : the formalities observed with them are as follow.  “‘ If a stranger present himself at the door of the convent in the garb of a faquir, namely, with a girdle  “ round his waist, his kneeling-mat suspended between his shoulders, his staff in his right hand, and his  « drinking vessel in his left, the porter of the convent comes up to him immediately, and asks what  ‘* country he comes from, what convent he has resided in, or entered on the road, who was the superior  “ of it, and other similar particulars, to ascertain that the visitor is not an impostor. If he find that  «his answers bear the stamp of truth, he opens the gate, admits him into the interior, and points out  “to him the place where he may spread his carpet at prayer time and perform his ablutions. This  “done, the visitor goes to the station allotted to him, spreads his carpet, unlooses his drawers, and  “« prays two reka’s; after which, he goes and shakes hands with the superior and the rest of the com-  “‘ munity who may be present at the time; he then sits down, and takes part in the conversation.   “This convent was plentifully endowed with rents for the support of its inmates, for, besides the  “ considerable revenue in lands with which it was provided by its founder, a wealthy citizen of Malaga,  “who had been governor of that city under the Almohades, pious men were continually adding to the  “ general fund, either by bequests in lands or by donations in money.”    » By Al-binf the author means, no doubt, Abi-l-’abbés Ahmed Ibn Ab{’-I-hasan ’Ali Ibn Ydeuf  Al-korayshi, a Mahommedan divine of great repute, who wrote several treatises on the occult sciences,  the art of divination, and the manner of constructing talismans. There is a work by him in the Escurial  Library (No. 920), entitled Shemsu-l-ma'drif, treating of the names and attributes of Divinity, copies of  which may be found in the Brit. Mus.

"    CHAP. 1.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 407    10 The author means Abii ’Abdillah Ahmed Ibn Yiisuf Ibn Hid Al-jodh4mi, a descendant of the royal  family of the Beni Hud, which had occupied the throne of Saragossa for a period of upwards of a hundred  years. This prince, who by the ruin of his family had been reduced to enter into private life, was living  quietly at Escuriante, near Granada, when the Andalusians, who were anxious to shake off the heavy yoke  of the Almohades, proclaimed him their king in six hundred and twenty-five (a. p. 1228), under the title  of Al-mutawakel-billak. He, however, did not long enjoy the empire, for he was strangled in his bed in  six hundred and thirty-six (a.p, 1238), by a treacherous governor, in whose castle he had been  hospitably received and entertained.   This passage is very important, as it gives us the date of Ibnu Sa’fd’s work, which must have been  written between six hundred and thirty-four of the Hijra (a. p. 1237),—the time of Ibn Hiid’s greatest  power,—and the accession of his rival Ibnu-l-ahmar in six hundred and thirty-six or six hundred and  thirty-seven (a. p. 1239-40). See Casiri, Bib. Arab. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 211, et passim; and Conde,  Hist. de la Dom. vol. iii. pp. 4, 20, et seq.   At the time when Ibnu Sa’id wrote it was the fashion in Egypt for theologians and K4dis to wear  very high turbans. Ibn Battiittah, in his original travels, speaks of a doctor named Fakhru-d-din, whom  he met in Alexandria, and who, he says, wore so high a turban that when sitting in the mosque, close to  the mihrdb, the top of it almost reached the ceiling of the place so called in the Mohammedan places of  worship. The inhabitants of the eastern provinces of Spain, such as Valencia, Murcia, Catalonia, and part  of Aragon, still go bare-headed. They use, instead of hats, a cotton kerchief, of gay colours, generally  red or yellow, twisted round their heads in the shape of a turban.    wb wy boib taylasén means ‘a sort of short cloak,’ as it was used in Spain in the sixteenth and  seventeenth centuries, a little closer to the body and less ample than that which is at present used,  and having, besides, a small cape or hood. I find in the Kitdbu-l-mugh'rib f¢ tartibi-l-mwarib (Arab.  MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 7438, p. 104), of which I possess also a copy, the following description  of this dress. ‘‘ Taylasdn is a corruption from .)2)l tdleshdn, a sort of dress used by the Persians ;  “it is generally black and cut round; hence the expression so common among the Arabs, ya ibnu-t-  “‘ taylasdn, (O son of the taylasén/) meaning a Persian, since the people of that nation, we repeat,  “commonly wear it. Taylasdn forms its plural thus, duJlio tiydlisah.” Tbnu-t-taylasén is also the  surname of a famous Cordovan historian who flourished in the sixth century, and whose entire name  was ‘Abdullah Ibn Ahmed Ibn Suleymén Al-anséri. See Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 129,  c.2. See also a learned note of M. De Sacy, in vol. ii. of his Chr. Arab. p. 269.

The riders rode with pennons  “ fluttering behind them, each man in his rank being known by his arms, or some other distinction  “about his person. However, in our days military men have left off these customs, and, returning to    “their old practices, have taken short and slender breast-plates, light head-pieces, the Arabian saddle,  “ Jeather bucklers called Jamatt‘,* and long and slender spears.”    ""8 Qla 7!

The text simply says Wl poll We ps!  ‘they invented or found the use of the muwashshahdt,’ without explaining whether that word is applied  to a new metre, or to a poetical composition.

Mosl. vol. iv. p. 493) mentions a poet named Abi Bekr Yahya Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahm4n Ibn Baka,  who became famous for his proficiency in the muwashshahdt, a word which Reiske translated by variegata  striis et orbiculis carmina.    The verb Pe y) washshaha, in the second form, means, according to Jeuhari in Golius, to put on the    swathe called waskdh. Now the word cH 9 according to the Kitdbu-l-mugh'rib ft tart(bi-l-mu’arib    fi-l-loghah (an Arab. Dict. in my possession), signifies ‘a girdle made of leather, ornamented with studs.’  The writer adds that, ‘according to Al-leyth, the washdh is an ornament used by women, and consists of  “two bracelets made out of two strings of pearls and precious stones, placed in opposite ways, one of the  “ two strings being inclined towards the other; the verb washshaha is therefore used to express the action    “ of wearing the above-mentioned ornament.” os! ules Tul! i> ow cos vw! ew! ~  ill pig fp) de Lace! Gijens yly Ble age 9 dd oe olbs    I may now, perhaps, hazard a conjecture. It is well known that the Arabs call poetry in general  or    fal nidham, that is, a string of pearls, and that to write poetry is called among them to ‘string to-  gether the pearls of speech.’ The word jx i muwashshahah, which is a feminine adjective, meaning  “a woman or thing ornamented with bracelets set in pearls and jewels,’ might well have been applied  to a species of descriptive poem (kassfdah), such as those appear to be that received that name. As  far as my own observation goes, the few instances that I have met with of poems so called resemble  in every respect the kassidah, only that they are generally descriptive of heroes, women, fruits, slave-  boys, love, &c. But this, I repeat, is merely a conjecture of mine, and unless the explanation of this word  be found in some work hitherto unpublished, the doubt must always exist. The Arabic dictionaries that  we possess are, generally speaking, insufficient, but when used in the translation of works written in  Spain, where the language was so much altered as to become almost strange to Arabs newly arrived from  Syria or Yemen, they are indeed of little or no assistance, being all written in the East. It is only  by means of dictionaries written in Spain or Africa, of which there are several in the Escurial, that  difficulties like this can be surmounted.    % Tbnu Sa’fd being in Africa when he wrote the work from which the present extracts are taken  used the expression § 3 dsl] sda AP ‘on these shores.’ I ought to observe here that the word    ee ’  34 dc ‘idwah, which means ‘a shore,’ ‘the bank of a river,’ ‘any thing diametrically opposed to another,’    and hence the coasts of Spain and Africa, has not been properly translated either by Casiri or Conde,  3°    who mistook it for % gee aduwwah, the ‘enemy’s country.’ It is essential to know that for writers  residing in Africa the word ’idwah always meant the opposite coast, that is, Spain, and vice versd for  those who lived in the latter country. I find this word used by Al-bekri (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus.  fo. 77, et passim), and by other ancient writers; it agrees exactly with the words aguende and allende,  so often used in a similar sense by Spanish writers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the former  designating Spain, the latter Africa.

CHAPTER II.    1 Zary4b is the surname of Abd-l-hasan ’Ali Ibn N4fi’, a celebrated musician. Al]-makkari has given  his life in the fifth book of the first part of his work, counting him in the number of those who came  from the East to settle in Andalus. I translate the passage entire, as it is very interesting: ‘‘ Zaryéb  “« was formerly a freedman of the Khalif Mahdi, the ’Abbassi. According to the author of the Muktabis  « (Ibnu Hayy4n) Zaryab was an appellation given to Abti-]-hasan by the people of his native town, owing  “to his dark complexion, the eloquence and suavity of his speech, and the amiability of his temper ;  “« zarydb being the name for a very rare and valuable bird,’ of dark plumage, which is to be found in  “that country, and has a very sweet note. He was likewise an excellent poet, for nature had also  “« favoured him with talents for poetry, and he composed in the most tender strains; he had a son named  “ Ahmed, who inherited from his father the taste for poetry.” The occasion of his coming to Andalus         + Ad-demiri, in his Hayydtu-t-haywdn, describes this bird, but he does not say how the word wh Fj is to be spelt; I am  not sure, therefore, of having written it right, as it might as well be pronounced Zorydb, Zerydb, or Zariyéb. Indeed  Cardonne, who mentions this musician and relates an anecdote which happened to him with Ar-rashid (Hist. de Afr.  vol. i. p. 283), calls him Zeriab. As to the bird itself, Ad-demir{ mentions it, but his description is so obscure and unsatis-  factory that it is by no means easy to determine to what family it belongs. The words of that naturalist are as follow :    “ The zarydb is said in the work entitled Mintaku-t-teyrdnch (the language of the birds) to be the same as the Bai 2!    “abi zorreyk, (another copy says ‘as the zorreyk.’) It is a bird of very quick intellect and easy to teach, surpassing even  “the parrot in memory and clearness of enunciation, so much so that when well trained it will talk so distinctly as to  “ make those who hear it believe that they are listening to a man.”",476,,
"    CHAP. II.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 411    is thus related: “ Zaryéb was the pupil of Is’hék, of Maussal, the famous musician, who lived in  “Baghdad during the reign of Hardin Ar-rashid. Under the tuition of this celebrated professor  “‘ Zaryéb learnt music and singing; but he soon made such progress in that science, and displayed  “‘s0 fine a voice, united to a good ear and exquisite taste, that he shortly surpassed his own master,  “and all the people of Baghdad gave his songs the preference over those of Al-maussali. However,  “ his master remained long unconscious of his pupil’s superiority, until Ar-rashid having once sent for  “him asked him, as is well known, to make him acquainted with a fine singer and good performer,  “whose name should not be known to him; when Al-maussalf mentioned Zary4b, his pupil, and  “ added—‘ He is a freedman of thy family; I once heard him sing in so tender a strain, and with so  “ much soul, that I did not hesitate to take him with me, and make him my disciple ; he has since very  “ much improved, and whatever he knows he owes to me, who found out his talents, and brought them  “to light: so great has been his improvement under my discipline, that I have predicted that he will live  “to be a famous musician.’ Ar-rashid then answered, ‘ That is the very man I want; bring him here  “to me, and I will tell him what I want him for.’ Zary&b accordingly appeared before Ar-rashid, who  “ began to converse with him, and was very much struck with the sweet melody of his voice and his  “excellent pronunciation. He then asked him, ‘ What are thy performances in music? Dost thou  “‘ know how to sing a song?’ ‘ Yes, O prince of the believers!’ answered Zary&b, ‘I approve of what  “ people like; but I like many songs which the people do not approve of. I feel confident, however,  “ that thou wilt like them, and if thou give me leave to sing thee one which I have reserved for thee,  “and which no ears have ever yet heard, I am sure thou wilt be pleased.’ Immediately Is’h4k’s lute  “« was sent for; but when presented to him Zary4b said, ‘ Pardon me, O prince of the believers! but  “I have a lute of my own, constructed with my own hands, and finished according to my method,  “and I never play on any other instrument ; if thou allow me I will send for it; it will be found at the  “door of thy palace.’ This request being readily complied with, Zaryéb’s own lute was produced; but no  “sooner did Ar-rashid cast his eyes on the instrument, than, seeing it entirely like that which Zarydh  “had refused, he could not help remarking, ‘ What made thee refuse to play on thy master’s lute?’  “* Please your highness,’ replied Zary&b, ‘ had the prince of the believers desired me to sing one of my  “ master’s songs I would have made use of his instrument; but since it was my lord’s pleasure that I  “‘should sing one of my own composition I had no choice but to play on my own lute.’—* What  ** difference is there,’ said Ar-rashid, ‘ between thy instrument and thy master’s? for me, I see none; they  “* seem to me perfectly alike.’—‘ So they are, in appearance, O prince of the believers!’ replied Zary4b,  ‘but they are very different in voice; for although mine is equal in size, and made of the same wood,  ‘yet the weight of it is greater by nearly one-third, and the strings are made of silk, not spun with  ‘* hot water procured by a woman,‘ while the second, the third, and the fourth strings are made of  “the entrails of a young lion, which are known to be far superior to those of any other animal in point  “* of strength, deepness of tone, and clearness of sound; besides, they will bear much longer pulsation  “‘ without being injured, and are not so easily affected by the changes of temperature.’ Ar-rashid was  “ delighted with Zaryéb’s explanation of his instrument; he ordered him to sing, and, having tuned his  ** instrument, Zary4b tried it, and began the following song :—  * O thou fortunate king, born under a happy star! men come to thee morning and evening.’         7 BEN la Ca Te i Be we sb! 5    < The text reads Udiey z) Ue 3,6, 5) which conveys no sense whatever.

"    412 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book 1.    “No sooner had Zaryéb finished this first verse than he was interrupted by Ar-rashid, who began to  “« repeat the air, and said to Ishak, ‘ By Allah! were it not that I consider thee a veracious man, and  ** believe that the talents of this youth were entirely unknown to thee; were it not for his protestations  “that thou hast never heard this song from him, I would have thee punished immediately for not ac-  “« quainting me with his abilities; I order thee to take him under thy special direction, and give him all  “* the instruction thou art capable of, and I shall be the judge of his progress.’ When Is’h4k heard the  « Khalif utter these words he was greatly vexed, and he repented that he had ever mentioned his name,—  “‘ envy lodged in his heart, and he hated Zaryéb. Some time after the adventure we have just related,  «« Ishak closeted himself up with his disciple, and addressed him in the following terms: ‘O Abu-l-hasan!  “hear my words. Envy is one of the basest vices, and yet one of the most common in this world, and  “ principally among people following the same profession. It is in vain that men struggle against it ;  “‘ they never can conquer it. I cannot but confess that I am myself the victim of its attacks; I feel  “‘ envious of thy talents, and the high estimation in which thou art held by the Khalif; and I see no way  “to free myself from it unless it be by depreciating thee and denying thy abilities; but in a short time  «hence thy reputation will increase, and mine will gradually vanish, until thou art considered my superior  “by every body. This, by Allah! I will never suffer even from my own son, much less be the in-  “ strument of it. On the other side, thou art aware that if thou possess any abilities, it is all owing to  “‘my having taken care of thy education, and fostered thy talents; had I not taught thee all my  “« secrets, thou wouldst never have arrived by thyself at thy present eminence. I have, therefore, to  “« propose to thee two expedients,—either to leave this country immediately and go and settle in distant  “lands, whence the fame of thy name may never arrive here,—or to remain in this city against my will,  ‘living upon thy own resources, having me for thy implacable enemy, and being in perpetual fear and  “anguish at my enmity. If thou decide for the first, and engage thy word never to return to this  “ country as long as I am alive, I promise to provide thee with every necessary for thy journey, and give  “‘ thee, besides, whatever sum of money and other articles thou mayest ask from me; if, on the contrary,  “« thou resolve upon staying, beware! I shall not cease one moment attacking and harassing thee with  “all my might, and I shall spare no trouble or expense to obtain thy perdition; nay, I will risk my  “life and my property to ensure it. Now consider, and choose.’ Zarydb left the room, and, having  “weighed attentively in his mind the reasons given by his master, returned soon afterwards and  “determined upon leaving the country. Is’hak then kept his word; he provided Zary4b with every  “ necessary for the journey, gave him, besides, a very considerable sum of money, and, thus provided with  “« feathers to his wings, Zary&b took his flight, and left his master, who felt thereby relieved of a great  “« oppression on his heart.   “‘ However, it happened that Ar-rashid one day, after hearing Is’hak sing, remembered Zary&b, and  “* earnestly inquired about him: Is‘h4k then said, without appearing at all disconcerted, ‘ Whom does the  ‘* prince of the believers mean? that insane youth who pretends to hold conversation with the Jinn, and  “to learn his songs from them? who thinks that he has not his equal in this world, and that the gifts of  “‘ the Khalif are to be poured profusely upon his head? Well, some time ago he took it into his head to  “« forsake the path which promised him so many advantages ; he conceived a dislike to his profession, he  “began to despise that which would have been a source of honour to him, and he quitted me without  “ telling me whither he was going ; and this I consider quite providential for the prince of the believers,  ‘since he was of late subject to attacks of insanity, during which his expressions were exceedingly  “* furious, and his manner so violent that he terrified all those who looked at him.’ Ar-rashid seemed  “ satisfied with this explanation, and never afterwards inquired about Zary4b.”",478,,

"    4l4 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book 11.    As the author of the said work, Abii Bekr Mohammed Ibnu-l-walid Al-fehri At-tortoshi (of Tortosa),  lived before Ibnu Sa’fd, and even before Ibn Ghdlib, there can be no doubt that he was the authority for  this and other anecdotes which, together with many more of the same kind, may be read in his very  interesting work. The copy in the Bodleian is a small octavo of about four hundred pages, badly written  in a large, careless, neskhi hand ; diacritical points are often wanting, and the numerous blunders which,  at every step, meet the eye, show that the copyist was one of those illiterate transcribers with whom the  East has at all times been infested, to the utter discomfiture of the Oriental scholar. The life of the  author is to be found in Ibn Khallekén (Tyd. Ind., No. 616). His entire name was Abi Bekr Mohammed  Tbnu-l-walid Ibn Mohammed Ibn Khalf Ibn Suleymén Ibn Ayitb Al-korayshi Al-fehri At-tortoshi    rece    Al-andalusi. He was also known by the surname of 4505; wi! Tbn Zendakah, which that biographer  says is a Frank word, meaning AP ad Q y ‘he has denied the Omnipotent,’ but which, in all probability,    is nothing more than the feminine of the word zendik, and means ‘the son of the fire-worshipper,  or unbeliever.’ At-tortoshi was born in four hundred and forty-five, or, as in other copies, in four  hundred and fifty-one (a.p. 1053-9); he died at Alexandria, in five hundred and twenty-one (a.p.  1126-7).    ® Hariz Ibn Hakem Ibn Ble ’Okkdshah (the son of the spider) was a general of Al-m4min Ibn  Dhi-n-niin, King of Toledo. His life occurs in the Kitdbu-l-hollati-s-seyrd (or silken vest), a biography of  illustrious Moslems, by Ibnu-l-abbar (Arab. MS. in the Esc. Lib., No. 1654, and also in the Nat. Lib.  Mad., Gg. 12). He is represented as a warrior of undaunted courage and great abilities, and a man of great  physical strength, colossal size, and uncommon dexterity in handling all the weapons of war. He made  his first campaign under Abii-l-walid Ibn Jehwar, Wizir of Cordova, whose party he followed during the  civil wars which distracted that kingdom towards the middle of the fifth century of the Hijra. ‘“ When  ‘‘ Cordova was taken by treachery by the troops of Mohammed Ibn ’Abb4d, King of Seville, (a.a.  “ 435,) Hariz was seized, with other Cordovan chiefs who were obnoxious to the usurpers, and  “‘ cast into prison, but he contrived some time afterwards to make his escape. He took refuge at  “the court of Al-mémun, King of Toledo, whence he soon returned to Cordova at the head of a  ‘« powerful army, besieged that city, and killed Ser&ju-d-daulah Ibn ’Abbéd, son of the King of Seville.  “ Hariz continued to govern Cordova until the death of Al-m&min, King of Toledo (a.H. 469),  “‘when Al-mu’atamed, anxious to revenge the death of his son, appeared again in sight of Cordova  “with a considerable camp, and pressed the siege with great ardour. After a most obstinate defence  “of several months, Hariz was at last obliged, through the want of provisions, to abandon the city.  “‘ He accordingly sallied out at the head of a few followers by the gate of Ibn ’Abdi-l-jabbar, while  “ the victorious troops of Al-mu’atamed were making their way into the town by that of Algesiras; but,  “being closely pursued by Al-mu’atamed, who thirsted for revenge, he was overtaken, and transfixed  ‘« by a lance which the King of Seville thrust at him: his head was then severed from his body, paraded  “ through the streets of Cordova, and, at last, nailed by the side of a dog to a wooden plank, where it  «« was left exposed to wild beasts and the birds of prey.   “ Hariz left one son, named Ahmed, who inherited his courage and military talents, and whom  “Yahya, son of Al-m&min, King of Toledo, appointed to be governor of Calatrava, in consideration  “of his father’s services. Ahmed, however, was not long in sharing his father’s fate; he was  “assassinated in the year four hundred and eighty (a.p. 1087-8), by the order of Al-mu’atamed.”  See Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp.

The present can be no other than  Alfonso VI., who, after the assassination of his brother, Sancho II. of Castile, before the walls of  Zamora, in 1072 of our era, united on his head the crowns of Castile and Leon; the same king  who, some years afterwards, assisted Al-mémdn in his wars against Al-mu’atamed, and who, after  the death of the former Sultén, snatched from his son Yahya the city of Toledo in 1085.

It was called also ‘the white city,’ Medfnatu-l-baydhd, no doubt owing to the quality  of the ground on which it stands,—a sort of whitish clay. It was built by Rab&h, one of the captains  who came with Musa Ibn Nosseyr to the conquest of Spain. In 1158 it became the possession of the  famous military order of that name, to which it was intrusted for defence. ,    ud 3 F bardz is an enclosed field prepared for tournaments, races, and other military sports.

There is in Spain a town called Castro-Xeriz, which might well be  the same here intended, as the words Castro-Xeriz are but a translation of Kal’at Hariz, since Castro,  from the Latin Castrum (whence the modern words Castillo, Castiel, Castin, Castelar, Castril, Castillon,  Castillejo, so common on the map of Spain), means ‘a castle or fortress ;’ but being in the province  of Burgoz, and on the limits of that of Valencia, a country which had then long ceased to belong to  the Arabs, the conjecture cannot be admitted.   There is another town south-west of Toledo, in the province now called Estremadura, named Xerez de  los Caballeros (Xerez of the knights), to distinguish it from the city of the same name close to Cadiz,  and which may be the place intended. :    yr! ed We, oS we ious Ly  gl nL fOmte di. wo VW. rea ro  us wl; caren; i) sem J fo Loy  gor! wpe sols vey Oe slip",481,,

The Christian monarch here alluded to can be no other than Sancho Ramirez, son of Ramiro I.,  King of Aragon, who was killed at the siege of Huesca, in a.p. 1094. The manner of his death is,  however, differently related by the Christian chroniclers, who all say that having approached too near  the walls, with the view of reconnoitring, he was, while raising his hand to show a point where the  assault might be made, mortally wounded by an arrow in his right side.    18 This is the same writer I have mentioned at Note 30, p. 319. The anecdote here related is also  given by Ibnu-l-khattib in the life of ’Abdu-l-mélik Ibn Sa’fd, who was then feudal lord of the castle  of Yahseb, and who is represented as having been so much pleased with the interview that he contracted  an intimate friendship with Al-hijéri, and called upon him to write the Mas‘hab, that historical work  which ’Abdu-l-mélik himself, and other members of his family, continued after his death. A fuller  account of the family of the Benf Sa’id will be given in another part of this work.    cue  19 The Beni Sa’id were lords of a certain castle called raw Yahseb, or, according to other au-    ve ee  thorities, Wrast Yohseb, and Cram Yahsob (now Alcal4 la Real), in the territory of Granada.

MS. in the Esc. Lib., No. 1750).  “ The castle of the Beni Sa’fd,” says that illustrious writer, ‘‘ was in former times called pas Shattir 9  “owing to a fountain of this name in the neighbourhood. It was afterwards called Kal’at Yahseb,  “ from the name of an Arabian tribe who settled in it soon after the conquest, and it is now denominated  “ after the Beni Sa’id, who were Lords of it.”    21 ""Abdullah Ibn Balkin Ibn Badis Ibn Habtis was the last Sultén of the Zeyri dynasty who reigned  at Granada. He was dispossessed of his states by Yusuf Ibn Téshfin, Sultan of the Al-murébetin  (Almoravides), and sent in irons to Africa in four hundred and eighty-three of the Hijra (a. p. 1090-1).  See Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 256.    2 Aj-walid Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahm&n Ibn ’Abdi-l-hamfd Ibn Gh&nim was Wizir to the Sultén Mohammed,  the fourth sovereign of the family of Umeyyah.

All the Sclavonians who composed the body-guard of  the Khalifs, or who filled offices in the palace, were previously made Moslems. However, the name of  Fatis or Foteys is not uncommon among Spanish Arabs. I may quote as an example Abi ’Abdillah  Mohammed Ibn Fatfs (or Foteys) Al-ghafek{ Al-elbirf (from Elvira), who is counted by Ibnu-]-khattfb in  the number of the illustrious men who were born or resided in Granada.    25 Abi Yahya Mohammed Ibn ole Samfdeh, surnamed Al-mu’atassem-billah, succeeded his    ,    father, Abti-l-ahwas Ma’n, King of Almeria, in the year four hundred and forty-three of the Hijra  (a. . 1051-2). He occupied the throne until four hundred and eighty-four. Conde calls him A/mutasim  Ebn Somide, (see Hist. de la Dom. vol. ii. p. 157;) Moura, (see p. 162 of his translation,) Damaded.   The palace here called ‘ Samddehiyyah,’ after that monarch’s name, must have been called by the Arabs  medinat, i.e. ‘a city;’ perhaps, like the Medinatu-z-zahré, near Cordova, it was more of a town than a  palace, for I find that Ibn Khallekén calls Al-mu’atassem “‘ King of Almeria, Bejénah, and Samédehiyyah.”  See Ibn Khallek4n’s lives, No. 698, Tyd.

The same might be said of his brother Ya’kiib, who is mentioned a little  lower.         CHAPTER III.    ! The reign of Al-hakem II. has deservedly been called the golden age of Arabian literature in Spain.  That Sultén, himself a lover of letters, which he cultivated with success, had numerous agents in the  East constantly employed in purchasing scarce and curious books, and no work of any note was written  of which a copy was not immediately sent to him. By these means, as well as by his liberality and  encouragement of literature at home, he succeeded in amassing a collection of books, the unfinished  catalogue of which, in the words of Ibnu-l-abbér, quoted by Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Ese. vol. ii. p. 202),  reached forty-four volumes. Even admitting that the number of volumes is greatly exaggerated, the  fact of a public library of such magnitude being formed in Europe in the tenth century of our era  is more than sufficient to establish, in the absence of other proofs, the superior culture and civilisation of  the Spanish Arabs. In the Appendix C. at the end of the volume the reader will ‘find some curious  information upon this library.    2 A sale by auction is called in Arabic soul al-munddah, whence the Spanish almoneda.

Emp. in Spain, p. 164,) has understood this proverb differently, and rendered it by ‘‘ He  gives away the nut who has no teeth;” but the reading in my manuscript being as above leaves no doubt  as to which is the true meaning.    i Hes jl zindtk (more correctly zendik, which forms its plural aso Fi zanddikah,) is the word by    which the Arabs generally designate all heretics of the numerous sects which have at various times  sprung up among them. The word, in its origin, meant a follower of the Magian sect, or a fire-worshipper,  a Saducean, a man who is neither a Christian, nor a Jew, nor a Mohammedan, and who professes no  religion whatever. The word is thus explained in the Kitdbu-l-mugh'rib, an Arabic dictionary in my    porsession. Clas ge y Gili! Bilaey 5 FSIL) Gaps Vail aaijy ype p55}!",484,,

Tha'leb says that the word zend/k, like the word firzin, is not  “ Arabic, and that its meaning is ‘a heretic, an impious man.’ Ibn Dureyd thinks that it is a Persian  “‘ word introduced into the Arabic language; that it takes its origin from the word ‘ zendah,’ meaning  “*the everlasting duration of time.’ In the work entitled Mafdtihu-l-’ohim (keys to the sciences)  “it is said that the zanddikah are the same as the followers of Méni (Manicheans), and that the  ‘* Mazdakis were also called zanddikah. Mazdak was a man who appeared in the days of Kob4d, and who  “« preached that all property, which is by law considered as sacred and private, should be held in common,  “and brought out a book entitled Zendd, the same book which Zardasht (Zoroaster), the pretended  “« prophet and founder of the Magian sect, gave to the world. It is said that the followers of Mazdak  “took their name from this book, and were called Ahlez-zend (the people of the Zend), which word  “was afterwards Arabicised, and corrupted into Zendtk.”   Mazdak and Mani were two impostors who agitated Persia. The former flourished under Kobéd, the  father of Kosroes Nishirwan. Mani lived in the times of Shapor, son of Ardeshir Babegin. See  D’Herb. Bib. Or. voc. Mani, Mazdak, Zendik.   On the action attributed a little lower down to Al-mansir the reader may consult the Appendix C. at  the end of this volume.    5 Abu ’Abdi-r-rahman Khalil Ibn Ahmed Ibn ?7Amrah Ibn Temim Al-far4hidi, one of the most famous  grammarians that the Arabs ever had, died, according to Ibn Khallekén (see Tyd. Ind., No. 219), in the  year 130 of the Hijra. Casiri (vol. i. p. 166) says in the year 75, which is a mistake.    6 Sibauyeh is the surname of the famous grammarian Abi Bashar ’Amra Ibn ’OthmAn Al-fars{ (the  Persian), whose life is in Ibn Khallekén (No. 515 in Tyd. Ind.) According to this author the word    ae  & gt may be pronounced either Sibiiyeh, which means, in Persian, ‘the scent of an apple,’ from    cee  ee (apple), and ose? (scent), or ray poe Sibauyeh. The same author adds that Abi Bashar was  so called from his having rosy cheeks: he died towards the end of the eighth century of our era. See  Abii-l-fed4, An.

"    420 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book 11.    Spanish word mozdrabe, which has no other origin than the Arabic Paws musta’rab, meaning a man  who tries to imitate or to become an Arab, in his manners and language, and who, though he may know  Arabic, speaks it like a foreigner. Under this denomination the Spanish Arabs comprised all the  Christians living in Cordova, Seville, Toledo, and other large cities, in the exercise of their laws and  religion; and in this sense the word is frequently used by Ibnu-l-khattib, Ibnu Bashkdwél, and other  Arabian writers. The origin which most Spanish historians, with the exception of Casiri (see Bib. Ar.  Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 18), have given to this word is not only inadmissible, but ridiculous. They say  that the Mozdrabes of Toledo were called so (Musa Arabes) from the fact of their having capitulated with  Musa Ibn Nosseyr ; but, firstly, Toledo was not taken by Misa, but by his freedman T4érik, who preceded  him; secondly, no capitulation was granted to the Christians of that city, who, according both to  Christian and Arabian authorities, fled to the mountains of Asturias with such valuables as they could  save from the hands of the conquerors; and thirdly, had the Christian population of Toledo been called  after the name of their conqueror, they would have been styled Musa-gothi, or some such name, but by no  means Arabes.   Others, again, derive it from Mizti-Arabes; but is it likely, I ask, that the Arabs should use two Latin  words to denominate a nation living under their sway and in the midst of their cities? As to the con-  jecture of an English writer, Mr. Weston, in his ‘Remains of Arabic in the Spanish and Portuguese  Languages,’ London, 1810, namely, that the ‘‘ Christians were called Mozdrabes, that is, Meseehee-Arabes  “ or Arabs of the Messiah, because they retained their own religious worship,” it is both ridiculous and  absurd.   The Muzarabs of Toledo having been the first Christians of any large Mohammedan capital to be  redeemed from their yoke by the arms of Alfonso VI., in the year 1085 of our era, and the Visigothic  liturgy having been in use among them, as well as among the Christians of other considerable towns of  Spain, the miseal which contained their religious rites was called from them el officio Muzdrabe  (the Muzarabic ritual).    8 Most of the MSS. in the Escurial Library are written in a sort of hand generally used in Spain from  the third to the eighth century of the Hijra. Casiri, mistaking it for the Kuff, or the system of writing  used by the people of Kufah, described all the manuscripts of this kind as ‘ Cuphicis litteris exarati,’ an  error since adopted by most of the writers who have blindly compiled or borrowed from his works,  without having the practical knowledge requisite to detect his mistakes. It is true that the character in  which three or four of the oldest manuscripts in that library are written very much resembles the Kuff in  the size and form of the letters, which are almost square, but even these bear the distinctive mark of the  Western hand-writing, namely, the point under, instead of over, the fa, and only one upon the kof. I  should have thought, and it is generally believed to be so, that the hand-writing used in Spain in the  fourth and fifth centuries —and of which there are numerous specimens in the Escurial — was originally  from Africa, whence it passed into Spain; but, according to Ibnu Khaldin (Arab. MS. in the Brit. Mus.,  No. 9574, fo. 127), the contrary seems to have happened. That eminent author says that during the  great emigration of the fifth century of the Hijra the Spanish Arabs introduced their hand-writing into  Eastern Africa, when it entirely superseded that which was generally in use there, so as to leave no  traces whatever of it except in the Belddu-l-jertd.    ® I am not quite sure of having well understood this passage, which is of some importance : Ree) ia)    eS pln Ops ne ell | La",486,,

[BooK 11.    16 iy 39 Dhi-r-rommah is the surname of a famous poet, called Abd-l-hareth Ghaylén Ibn  ’Okbah, who flourished in the second century of the Hijra: his life may be read in Ibn Khallekén (No.  534 in Tyd. Ind). Casiri wrote his name Ramah, but it is an error, for I find in the Kitdbu-l-muntekhab  fi-l-loghah, by Ibn Koteybah, (Ar. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 7525, fo. 21, verso,) that rommah means    “a rope, the threads of which are worn out,’ AP n=! key) ; and Ibn Khallekfén adds that he  was thus called from the circumstance of his having written an ode which began thus: sl Wnt]    oui he ) It is probable that the word maroma, which in Spanish means ‘a cable,’ comes from the  same root.   The expression ‘the book having been but recently published” must be applied to some commentary  on the poems of Dhi-r-rommah, for the works of that poet, one of the most ancient among the Arabs,  had been published and commented upon by Spanish Moslems long before the time here alluded to. (See  H4ji Khalfah, voc. Ditwdn Dhi-rommah.) Ibn Khallekén says of Ibn Zohr (Abi-l-’ala Ibn Zohr) that  he knew the poems of Dhii-r-rommah by heart.    7 The meaning of the word muwashshahah has already been explained (see Note 14, p. 408);. it is  like kass¥dah and zajalah, a species of poem.    ‘8 That is, by Abd Merwén Al-b6ji, a rebel who got possession of Seville in a... 620.

He wrote a Biographical Dictionary containing the lives  of eminent Spanish historians, and died in four hundred and thirty of the Hijra (a.p. 1038-9).    ® shad! Qe ll we Vynem) yy! may also be translated ‘to hear marvellous anecdotes of    authors,’ but I prefer the version in the text, especially as I find in H4ji Khalfah that Gharfbu-l-musannif  is the title of a work by Abu ’Amru Is’h4k Ibn Marér Ash-sheybani, who died in the year two hundred  and six (a.p. 821-2), the same that was commented upon by several writers, and, among others, by  Abi-l-’abbés Ahmed Ibn Mohammed, of Murcia, who died close upon four hundred and sixty  (a.p. 1067).    3\ The life of this grammarian occurs in Ibnu-l-abbér (loco laudato), as well as in Ibn Khallekén  (No. 460, Tyd. Ind.) I here translate the account of the last mentioned biographer. ‘* Abii-l-hasan  “Ali Ibn Isma’il, known by the surname of Ibnu-s-sidah, was the prince of his time in the  “‘ science of language and rhetoric, as well as in memory.

He first received lessons from his father, then from Abi-l-’ala  “ Sa’'id, of Baghd4d, and lastly from Abd Omar, of Salamanca. The last mentioned author relates an  “anecdote which occurred to him,” &c. (the same that the author has just recounted). De Sacy has  also treated of this author in several of his works. See Chr. Ar. vol. ii. p. 103, and Journ. des  Savans, 1819, p. 726. See also p. 37 of this translation, and p. 335, Note 33.    2 Both the original and the epitome place Ibnu-s-sidah’s death in the year 401, but Ibn Khallekan says  that he died at Denia, on the evening of Sunday the 26th of Rabi’ 11. of the year 458, or, according to  other authorities, 448, at the age of sixty or thereabout. Abt-l-fedé (An. Mosl. vol. iv. p. 208)  partakes of the same opinion. (See also D’Herb. voc. Seidah, and Rossi, Dizionario Storico, voc. Seira.)  Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. i. p. 168) says that he flourished towards the end of the fourth century  of the Hijra, which agrees better with the date given by Al-makkari. However, if Ibnu-s-sidah received  lessons, a8 Tbnu-l-abb4r and Ibn Khallekén seem to insinuate, from Abi ’Omar At-talamanki (of  Salamanca), who died in 480, the date fixed by the above writers for the death of Ibnu-s-sidah, viz. four  hundred and fifty-eight (a.p. 1065-6), seems the most probable.   The Kitdbu-l-mukhassass, mentioned by Ibn Khallekén, is an Arabic dictionary composed of twenty-four  volumes, or parts, two of which, the sixteenth and seventeenth, written in the city of Murcia, the birth-  place of the author, about a century after his death, are preserved in the Escurial Library under No. 575.  Parts of this dictionary may also be found in the Bodl. Lib. Oxon., as also in the Medicean Library.  (See their respective catalogues.) I ought to observe that the surname of this writer (Ibn Sidah or  Tbnu-s-sfdah) has been incorrectly written Seydak by almost every Oriental scholar. Casiri calls him  sometimes Ibn Seyra, and at others Sada; D’Herbelot, Seidah; Reiske, Seida; Hamacker, Seyidah. (See  Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. i.) His real surname, as I find it in Ibn Khallekén, is Saw vl Tbnu-s-sidah    (the son of the she-wolf, or lioness), for the word sidah, the feminine of sid, partakes of both meanings.    2 The life of this writer (who is no other than the Avempace of the middle ages) will be found in the  Appendix A. at the end of this volume, as translated from Ibn Abi Ossaybi’ah. Cusiri, wh also gives  an account of that philosopher translated from Ibnu-1-khattib, calls him at times Abvti-l-hasan ""Ali (see  vol. ii. p. 110), and at others Abi Bekr Yahya (see vol. i. p. 178).    % Instead of Granada the MS. A. reads Cordova. I have chosen the former reading, as it appears by  Ibnu-l-khattib that Ibn Bajeh resided mostly in Granada and Seville.    % Abt Hayyén the grammarian : Al-makkari hag treated of this writer at considerable length in various  parts of his work, but especially in Part 1. Book v., where he speaks about the illustrious Andalusians  who left their country to travel to the East. As Abu Hayy4n has not unfrequently been mistaken for  Ibnu Hayyén, of Cordova, an historian who preceded him by nearly two centuries, I have thought it  necessary to give here some extracts from his life, which occupies the fo. 174 and following in  A., and 142-160 in B. ‘ His entire name was Abi Hayyén Mohammed Ibn Yusuf Ibn ’Ali Ibn    “ Yusuf Ibn Hayyén aj} [Al-nefezi ?] Al-athiri, of Granada; he became the prince of Western gram-  yyan us P [4    “‘ marians, and acquired the greatest reputation by his works both in Andalus and in Egypt, where he  “ resided a long time, inhabiting the college called after Al-mansir, in Alexandria, to which he was",489,,

He there received the honorary  “ appellation of Athiru-d-din (the chosen friend of religion), by which he is generally known among the  “learned. Ibn Marztik, from whose work the preceding is an abridgement, makes him a native of  “ Granada, but Ibn Jabir, of Guadix, in his ‘ Eastern Travels,’ gives him the patronymic of Al-jayéni (of  “‘ Jaen), and says that he was born in the town of uw jUnsdee Mattakhashfres, near Jaen, towards the  “end of Shawwél of the year six hundred and fifty-four (Nov, a.p. 1256). If, however, we follow  “ Ar-ro’ayni’s opinion, Abid Hayy4n was born in the district of Granada. But this may be easily  “ reconciled, as most of the territory of Jaen was then a dependency of Granada.   « Abi Hayy4n, when still young, quitted his native place in order to repair to the East. He first  “visited Granada, Malaga, Velez, Almeria, and Bejénah, in Andalus; after this he saw Tunis and  « Alexandria, Cairo, Damietta; from thence he went to Ded! Mahlah, u~e ye [(Nahrmes ?], and  “« Jizzeh; then to Minyat-Khassib, Dashna, Kana, Kiiss, Belbis, and ’Aydh4b, in the land of the blacks:  ‘he also went to Mekka and Medina, and in every one of these places he never failed to converse with  ‘learned men, and to gather the most precious information respecting the history of their respective  “* countries, and anecdotes of illustrious individuals.   “The cause of Abi Hayy4n’s departure for the East is thus related by Ibn R&jih. They say that  “ enmity arose between him and one of his preceptors, whose name was Ahmed Ibn ‘Ali Ibnu-t-taba’,  “‘ owing to Ibnu Hayyén having composed a work which he entitled cub we! 3 jle1 ols Ae ey    “(the shining of the stars on the bad method of teaching followed by Ibnu-t-tab&’), and that the  “injured man having made a complaint to the Amir Mohammed Ibn Nasr, Abi Hayy4n, fearing his  “revenge, left his native town in the year six hundred and seventy-nine of the Hijra (a.p. 1280-1).  «« However, as we have already observed, Abi Hayyan quitted Andalus, and travelled to Africa proper,  “Egypt, Syria, and Hejiz, collecting every where the valuable information, which, like so many  “« inestimable pearls, he afterwards scattered through his writings. All authors agree in designating him  “as the king of his age in grammar = Ad eyed pel and as one who knew no rival as long    “Cas he lived. He was, likewise, an excellent poet, as his works sufficiently testify: as to his attainments  «in the science of traditions, his commentaries on the Kor&n, his deep acquaintance with civil law, and  ‘his profound learning in history, and anecdotes of illustrious men, chiefly Western Arabs, it will be in  “vain for any author of future ages to attempt to equal them. He distinguished himself above all  ‘things in that science which has for its object the spelling of proper names, since those of the  “* Andalusians, owing to their proximity to the country of Afranj (France), and their constant commerce  “and intermixture with the Christians, are well known to partake mostly of a construction entirely  “ contrary to the rules of Arabic grammar.   « Abi Hayy&én was a great favourite with Seyfu-d-din Arghin, (see D’Herb. voc. Arghoun,) the  “« superintendent of the slaves of HSL! QsLf Al-malek An-ndssir Mohammed, Sultén of Egypt.    ‘* He lived with him on terms of the greatest friendship, dwelling at his castle of b=!

It must have been exceedingly scarce, even in Spain, for I have never met in the  course of my historical investigations with any quotation or extract from it; nor is there in the Escurial  Library, nor, as far as I-know, in any public library in Europe, a single volume of the fifty of which the  work is said to have consisted.

This Moslem or Moslemah, who was a consummate astronomer and  mathematician, was probably one of the first to denounce the practice, and hence the surname given  to him of Sdhibu-l-kiblati-sh-sharkiyyah (the master of the ‘iblah turned to the east).

Another mathematician, also named Abi-]-késim Ibnu-s-saffér, is mentioned by Ibn Abf Ossaybi’ah in  his Biographical Dictionary of the Arabian physicians, fo. 134, verso. He calls him Abi-l-késim Ahmed  Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn ’Omar, and says that he was learned in arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy; that  he settled in Cordova, where he gave lectures upon those sciences, and published also some astro-  nomical tables according to the Indian doctrines, and a treatise on the manner of making astrolabes.  He adds that Ibnu-s-saffir quitted Cordova in the midst of the civil wars which wasted that city  (a.H. 400-8), and retired to Denia, the court of Mujéhid Al-’4miri, where be died. They are no doubt  the same person.    @ « Abi Is'hék or Abd-l-hasan ’Alf Ibn Suleymén Az-zahrawi,” says Ibn Abf Ossaybi’ah (loco  laxdato, fo. 134, verso), ‘‘ was learned in arithmetic and geometry, but he excelled above all things in  “medicine.

Sprung from a  race which the Arabs despised, the rulers of Andalus became the subject of many a satirical poem,  and the public animadversion was every where excited against them.

He was a native of Ronda, where he died on a Friday, the first day of the month of Shaww4l of the year  668, at the hour of prayers, just as the people were going out of the mosque.   Casiri, who translated the life of this author, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 82, committed a serious  mistake, which I think it necessary to rectify. He first of all made Ibnu-d-dabb4gh a native of Seville,  of which the MS. says nothing, and then he called him a professor of theology and jurisprudence to the  Royal College of Granada, and to another which he denominates ‘the college of the son of Azrah’ (in  Regio Granatensi Collegio jurisprudentiam, theologiam vero in Collegio Azre Filii dicto pralegit).

He also gave lectures in the mosque jdmi’, close to the  “ gate of the potters, and in the mosque of ’Adhrah, and in other places.” Passages like this, loosely  or badly translated, have given rise to several mistakes on the part of most of the compilers on  Hispano-Arabic history; and if the Royal College, literary institutions, and universities of Granada,  of which M. de Viardot speaks with so much enthusiasm in his Précis de I’histoire des Arabes et des Mores  en Espagne, Paris, 1833, had no other foundation to stand upon than the loose records of Casiri and  his mis-translations, we should be obliged a little to reduce the high ideas we entertain of the extent  of education among the Arabs.    pe Le ol ee isos Fae  suis 5 8 LG ye es    Instead of (which makes its plural ul ie) “a wedding’ and ‘wedlock,’ whence the Spanish    we  arras is derived, B. reads rae which has no meaning.

The  author calls him, a few lines higher, the conqueror of Toledo, by which Alfonso VI. only can be intended ;  but, as Toledo was not taken until the year four hundred and seventy-eight of the Hijra (a.p. 1085),  namely, one hundred and twelve years after the death of the Khalif Al-mustanser-billah Al-hakem, which  happened in three hundred and sixty-six (a.p. 976), the conjecture is inadmissible. On the other hand,  the only kings of Castile who were contemporaries with Al-hakem were Sancho the fat (from 955 to 967),  and Ramiro III. (967 to 982). It is true that the last king of Saragossa, of the family of Hiid, took  likewise the title of Al-mustanser-billah, by which name he is generally designated by the historians of  the time; but then the title of Khalif, which the author gives him, is misapplied, as it is ascertained  never to have been assumed in Spain after the overthrow of the Beni Umeyyah.    ® The name of this Jewish poet is written thus in B. 9 Aw) wy UWl—The verses are as follow:    Vaol, tel GaSe ae le pe yp LG eda y  Hoot gSRE GK Lenlingh BLES ne capella    y! wl ‘ the two moons’ is here elegantly taken for the sun and moon.    eae eel a Le IL 8 dee gd Wl  teye LHS ay akg Tl wy enla jaull Gee Gtl  One of the MSS. reads instead Lis .°.

He had a most amiable disposition,  “besides great tenderness of soul, and was very much attached to women, and especially to Hafsah,  “the famous poetess who flourished in Granada in the sixth century of the Hijra, and whose adventures  “we have related elsewhere.   “When the Sultan ’Abdu-l-miimen appointed his son Sidi Abii Sa’fd to be governor of Granada,  “the reputation of Ahmed, who was then residing in this capital, was so great, owing to his immense  “learning, and his beautiful compositions in prose and verse, which were in the mouth of every one,  “that the governor did not hesitate to raise him to the rank of Wizir and intrast him with the  “ administration of public affairs; but this high distinction was the immediate cause of his untimely  “and disastrous death, for, as we have related in our history of Granada, entitled AP) & yoy iw!)    “& pail ayo ‘the rays of the full moon on the history of the Beni Nasser’ (No. 1771 in the  “Esc.

However, Hafsah still continuing  “to receive her old friend at her house, Ahmed said to her one day, ‘ What good canst thou expect  “from that huge slave? (meaning the governor, who was of a dark olive complexion ;) I can procure  “thee a better one from the black slave-market for less than twenty dinfrs.’ These and similar ©  “expressions which Ahmed was in the habit of uttering, to indulge in his satirical propensities, and  “show his jealousy of the governor, having reached the ears of the latter, were the cause of his ruin,  “as we shall presently see.   “ The father and brothers of Ahmed, being all averse to the reigning dynasty of the Al-muwahhedin  “ (Almohades), were the secret partisans of Ibn Mardanish, who had, some time previously, raised the  “standard of revolt in the eastern districts of Andalus. They, therefore, began to solicit Ahmed   VOL. 1. 3L",507,,

One day his brother Mohammed and his father ’Abdu-l-mélik  “came up to him and said, ‘Thy verses, we are told, have been reported to the governor, who is  “highly indignant; they will, we have no doubt, be the cause of thy death, and of the ruin of all  * our family ; and, by Allah! as long as this country is ruled by the people of that dynasty (meaning  “the Almohades) there is no security for us. Better die in the attempt to establish our independence  “than remain here exposed to continual danger under the paw of this lion.’ It was then agreed  “ between them that Ahmed and his brother ’Abdu-r-rahmén should repair to the family castle and  “there rise in favour of Ibn Mardanish, in which undertaking they were to be assisted by their  “ relative ra (s Hé&tim Ibn Sa’id: this being determined upon, they wrote to that chief, and soon  “afterwards received an answer to their message, bidding them hasten to put their design into  “execution. But, unluckily for the Beni Sa’id, either the affair transpired, or they feared that it  “« would; certain it is, that, before the time fixed for the outbreak, ’Abdu-r-rahman and Haétim fled  “* precipitately from Granada and took refuge in their castle, where, the enterprise meeting with  “‘ entire success, they made preparations to defend it against their enemies. Ahmed, however, left  “* Granada with his servants and slaves, but too late; he was closely pursued by the troops of the  “* governor, so that, being unable to reach the castle in time, he changed his direction, and entered  “« Malaga, where he hid himself, hoping to be able, when the storm had passed, to embark for Valencia  ‘and join the army of Ibn Mardanish. But all was in vain; he could not escape the searching eyes of  “ the governor, who thirsted for revenge; he was discovered, seized, and soon afterwards executed.   “ His nephew, Abi-l-hasan ’Ali, says, ‘I was told by Al-hasan Ibn F290 Duwayrah, who was in  “‘ Malaga at the time of my uncle’s arrest, that having obtained permission to visit him in prison he  “ went to the place of his confinement, and could not help shedding abundant tears when he saw him  “« with fetters on his hands and feet; and that my uncle, observing his grief, remarked to him, ‘ Are those  “ tears shed for my sake,—for me, who have enjoyed all the pleasures that this world could procure, who  “* have fed upon the breasts of fowls, drunk out of crystal cups, rode on the best steeds, slept upon the  “« softest couches, dressed in the finest silks and brocades, been lighted with tapers of the purest wax, and  “* received the embraces of the fairest maidens? Here am I in the hands of justice, waiting for the  “« punishment of offences which neither admit of excuse nor deserve pardon,—the necessary consequence  “* of fate.’ To which Ibn Duwayrah replied, ‘How am I not to shed tears over one who is so eloquent  “ as thou art, and of whom the world will soon be deprived?’ He then left him, and saw him no more,  “* except on the cross in the hands of the executioner, (may God show him mercy !)’   “Tt is related by Hétim Ibn Sa’id that he heard his relative, Ahmed, repeatedly say to Hafsah,  “« during their intimacy, ‘ by Allah! Hafsah, thou only wilt be the cause of my death.’ He says, also,  “that when the news of her lover’s death was brought to her, she put on mourning clothes, showed  “‘ great sorrow, and reproached herself as having been the cause of his death. The execution of Ahmed  “Ibn ’Abdu-l-mélik Ibn Sa’id happened in the month of Jumadi 1. of the year five hundred and fifty-  “nine of the Hijra (April, a.p. 1164).”   Abd Ja’far was an excellent poet; he wrote also several works in prose.

"    CHAP. Iv.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 445    CHAPTER IV.    The whole of chapters rv, and v. is, as the author himself states, transcribed from the Kitdbu-/-  mugh'rib fi holi-l-maghreb, by Abi-l-hasan ’Ali Ibn Sa’id, the author mentioned at Note 1, p. 309. Their  contents will be found highly interesting, as conveying an idea of the extent and genius of the Hispano-  Arabic literature at the period of its greatest splendour. The former, especially, which contains the  account of worke and authors from the conquest of Spain up to the overthrow of the dynasty of  Umeyyah, is in itself invaluable, as it gives the titles of many interesting works, now, I fear, lost to the  world, and which are in vain looked for in H4ji Khalfah and other Arabian bibliographers. The additions  made by Ibnu Sa’id have also their merit; but, unluckily, from the system of writing of the Arabs, the  value of these two fragments is very much reduced; for if the scholar learns thereby the names of the  authors, and the titles of many works, he is aleo left entirely in the dark as to their respective merits, or  at least the judgments passed by the authors are not of a nature to remove the veil. He will have  therefore to judge for himself whenever the opportunity presents itself. The firet fragment, viz. the  epistle of Ibnu-r-rabib, and the answer by Ibn Hazm, are written in that florid and inflated style so  much to the taste of the Arabs, and in a species of rhymed prose, similar to that of the Koran, or that of  the Makdmdt of Hariri, and other rhetorical productions. Of the difficulties which such a style of  composition—strewed as it is with the most extravagant metaphors—presents in translating, only  Oriental scholars are able to judge. I shall, therefore, submit to their consideration such passages as are  obscure, or differently written in the various copies of the work.   Respecting the writer of the epistle (Abi ‘Ali-l-hasan Ibn Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibni-r-rabib At-  temim{, of Cairwin,) I have been unable to obtain any information whatever, having perused in vain the  biographical dictionaries of authors and illustrious men of the epoch in which he lived. The epistle is  addressed to Abti-l-mugheyrah ’Abdu-l-wahhéb Ibn Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Ibn Sa’fd Ibn Hazm,  whose life occurs in the Mattmah, by Al-fat’h, (Ar. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9580, fo. 53,) as well  as in the Jadh'watu-l-muktabis, by Al-homaydi, (Ar. MS. in the Bodl. Lib. Oxon., Hunt. 464 ;) but,  although addressed to him, the answer is not written by him, as I shall remark hereafter.   The title of the epistle of Ibn Hazm, written in answer to that of his antagonist, is not to be found  in the copies of H4ji Khalfah which I have consulted, but I learn from Kheyr Ibn Khalifah, the author  of a bibliographical work (Ar. MS. in the Esc. Lib., No. 1667),—a production far more valuable than  that of the former author in all that respects the literature of the Spanish Moslems,—that it was entitled    We, FIP Uta) ule A Blo, ‘an epistle on the excellences of Andalus, and an account of  its illustrious men.’    b Lj —The bogdth, according to Golius, is an inferior kind of vulture. It is thus described by  Ad-demiri, in his Hayydtu-l-haywdn: “ Bigdth or bogdth (for it may be written both ways) is a grey-  “coloured bird, somewhat larger than the aS, rakhmah (pelican ?); it is slow in its flight, is con-  “« sidered of bad omen, and never chased by sportsmen.”    2 A. reads ileal ewe) 7B slix!l—I have followed the former reading.

Tbn Moklah passes among the Arabs for the inventor of the characters called neskhi,  which he substituted for the kif{; but De Sacy has lately shown that the characters given as an  invention of Ibn Moklah were in use long before his time.   The penmanship of Ibn Moklah became proverbial among the Arabs. I find in the above-mentioned  work, the Thimdru-l-kolib, by Ath-th’élebf, fo. 35, the following passage, which I translate entirely,  as it abounds with curious information. ‘‘ The hand-writing of Ibn Moklah became proverbial among  “the Arabs, owing to its being the finest and clearest hand that ever was known, and one the like of  “‘ which men had never seen in the past times. The sight of it almost produced the effects of enchant-  “ment: so when the Arabs now want to praise a scribe’s hand-writing, they call it Ibn Moklah’s hand.  “ The Sultén Abi-1-k4sim Ibn ’Abbéd has said in verse—    alee Qu yliny 7 ELE py    ‘ The hand-writing of the Wizir Ibn Moklah was the garden of the heart and the fruit of its palm  ‘ trees.’    ‘ Another poet has said—    ELE y Least) Ree, Ly o Ua) 5 gde re a dey  clive Lo) be ail pad , oo wo) Wy esl! tof    ‘May God pour his mercy upon the tomb of this man, who has disappeared from among the  ‘ living, and gone never to return again.  ‘ Like the face of Habib, the heart of Adib, the verses of Walfd, or the hand-writing of Ibn  * Moklah.’   “ This Ibn Moklah was the celebrated Abi ’Ali Mohammed Ibn ’Alf Ibn Al-hasan Ibn Moklah, who   “ wrote with his own hand a truce between the Moslems and the Greeks, which is to this day held in great  “ estimation by the infidels, and preserved by them in Constantinople in the great church called yyy  “« (Pir-Ruzanah ?) placing it in their most revered shrines, and taking it out in their processions, owing to the  “‘ admirable manner in which it is executed. Ibn Moklah filled the situation of Wizir under three successive  “ Khalifs of the house of ’Abb4s, Al-muktader, Al-k4hir, and Ar-rédhi, under whose reign he passed through  “* many vicissitades of fortune, until, by the order of the latter, he had his hand cut off ;—what a pity that  “so precious a hand should have been severed from his body! It is related by Thabit Ibn Senan Ibn  “ Thabit-korrah, the physician, that on the day in which the sentence was executed upon Ibn Moklah,  “and his hand cut off, he received an order from the Khalif Ar-radhi to repair immediately to Ibn  ‘* Moklah’s residence, and attend him until he should be cured. ‘I went to him,’ says Thabit, ‘ and  “* dressed his wound; he inquired about his son, Abt-]-huseyn, and I told him that he was safe, hearing  ‘which he appeared to gather strength and seemed delighted. After this he began to cry and said to  **me,—‘ With this hand have I served three Khalifs and written the Kordn thrice over, and yet it has  “ been cut off as if it were that of a thief. Dost thou remember when thou didst say to me, Thou art on  ** the last stage of misery,—take courage, for pain is nearly over, and joy is at hand; well, thou seest to  “* what state I have been reduced since.’ ‘ Never mind,’ said I to him, ‘this cannot last much longer, for  ** although it be true that thou hast been dealt with in such a manner as no man ever was treated before,  “* yet calamity, like many other things, has its end, and when it has risen to such a pitch it cannot  “‘but abate its fury.’ ‘No, thou shalt not convince me,’ replied Ibn Moklah; ‘love has grasped  “‘me in a manner that will lead me step by step to utter perdition, in the same manner as the",513,,

Ibn Moklah’s prophecy was speedily fulfilled, for, after a while, having been restored  “to the charge of Wizir, he entered into a correspondence with Hakem the Turk, who had been general  “of the armies of Al-kahir. Intelligence of this having reached Ibn Réyik, who then commanded the  “troops of Ar-rédhi, he accused him of treason against his sovereign, and the Khalif ordered that  “Ton Moklah’s left hand should be cut off, and some time afterwards that his tongue should be cut  “also; he was, besides, cast into a dungeon, where he remained a long time. . But Ibn Moklah’s  « misfortunes did not end here; he was, while in prison, attacked with dysentery, and not having  “at hand any one to cure him or to take care of him, he was the most wretched and miserable of  “‘men; so much so that I was told by the gaoler that, in order to drink, he was obliged to hold a  “rope between his teeth and dip it in the waters of a well inside his prison, and then suck it with  “his mouth; in one word, his sufferings were almost inexpressible until death came to relieve him  “from his misfortunes. Ibn Moklah was first buried, like other criminals, in the court of the Sultén’s  “ palace, close to the prison. After this his family implored the Khalif’s permission to disinter his  “body, and this being granted, his remains were removed to the dwelling of his son, Abu-l-huseyn,  ‘and there buried; at last Ibn Moklah’s widow, a freedwoman of the name of Dinarivyah, had him  “* again disinterred and removed to her residence in the palace of Um-habib. But the most extraordinary  “ thing related of this Ibn Moklah is that, while in prison, after he had had his hand cut off, and before  “he had been deprived of his tongue, he used to write to the Khalif Ar-rédhi, asking him for certain  “ sums of money he had promised him. His becoming lame of his right hand did not incapacitate Ibn  “« Moklah from discharging the duties of the Wizirate, for he continued to write most beautifully with his  “left hand, or by using some other contrivance unknown to any one. The fact is, that a little before  “his last misfortune his son received a letter from him admirably executed, and which, he said, had  “ been written either with the left hand, or with a kalam fixed on the stump of the right arm. It  “has been remarked of Ibn Moklah that he served three dynasties, copied thrice the Korén, per-  “« formed three pilgrimages, and was buried the same number of times.”    6 Both the copies have pres kadhiém, which means ‘the dent or groove at the upper end of the    arrow, where the feathers are placed.’ Dagfal Ibn Handhalah (see D’Herbelot, loco /audato,) was one of  the companions of the Prophet, although he held no traditions from his mouth. He was killed at the  battle of Dol4b, by the people of Irak, during the Khalifate of Mu’awiyah, the first of the Beni Umeyyah.

In addition to what I have there said of this poet, I find in Ibnu  Bashkiwél that he left a collection of poems. That biographer adds that he died from the result of a  paralytic fit, with which he was struck come years before, on the 18th of Jumfda 1., a. #. three hundred  and twenty-eight (March, a. p. 940).    ® This is the same individual mentioned in p. 37, and Note 31, p. 334. His life, as well as that of his  brother, Al-mugheyrah, occurs in the Mattmah, by Ibn Khékén, fols. 53 and 144.    10 I have already observed (see p. 445) that although both the individual to whom the epistle is  addressed, and he who answers it, bear the name of Ibn or Ibnu Hazm, they are two distinct persons,  and must not be confounded. They must have been brothers, since both are said to have been sons    of Ahmed, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmén, son of Sa’id, son of Hazm. The text says, ra coal Uy JJ    dand 8 $I 3 3 4 aul ais ‘To an Andalusian whose name and genealogy are nowhere mentioned.’    According to Ibnu Bashkdwél it was considered a breach of politeness not to mention in the body of  the letter the name, titles, and genealogy of the person to whom it was addressed, as happens to be the  case in the present.    u sig ye Hisn-Al-bént or Alpont is, I believe, the town of Alpuente, in the province of  Valencia.

The expedition here alluded to took place soon after Suleym4n’s accession to the throne. It was  commanded by Moslemah Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, brother to that Khalif. Huseyn Ad-diyarbekri, the author  of a voluminous history of the Khalifs in my possession, (see Preface,) says that it took place in the year  99, and that it was composed of land and sea forces, in which case Moslemah may have commanded the  army, while Hobeyrah had the management of the fleet. A son of this general, named Abi-l-moththanna  Ibn Hobeyrah, was governor of ""Irék under Yezid, son of ’Abdu-l-malek. See Al-makin, apud Erpen.  pp. 78, 79, and Abu-l-faraj, Hist. Dynast. p. 205.    18 Tt is not easy to reconcile the accounts of this writer with those of Abii-1-fedé and the generality of  the Arabian historians. According to them the island of Cyprus was not entirely subdued until the days  of Hérin Ar-rashid, a.#. 190. (See Al-makin, apud Erpen. p. 119.) However, as the word fataha, ‘to  enter, to invade, to conquer,’ is so vague in its signification, the author may allude to the expedition  against that island made during the Khalifate of ’Othm4n; but even then this could not be the first  maritime war carried on by the Arabs, since Ibnu Khaldiin (see App. B., p. xxxiv.) speaks of another  directed against the coast of ""Oman thirteen years before. Neither was Spain the second country  invaded by sea, since shortly after their invasion of Africa the Arabs began to scour the neighbouring  seas, and naval expeditions against Sicily, Mallorca, and other islands in the Mediterranean, were crowned  with success even long before the conquest of Spain was dreamt of. (See App. B. and D.) The  historian Nuwayri mentions no less than four expeditions against Sicily, all of which started from the  ports of Africa. The first, which was commanded by ’Abdullah Ibn Kays Al-fezéri, took place as early  as the year forty-five (a.p. 665). See the text of that historian published by Gregorio Rosario,  Panormo, 1790.   The island of Sicily had likewise for many years been the theatre of these piratical incursions, when it  was finally subdued under Ziyddatu-llah Ibn Ibréhim, Sultan of the dynasty of the Beni Aghlab, in the  year two hundred and twelve of the Hijra (a. p. 827-8), as here stated.

Another is the famous historian and poet ’Abda-1-majid  Abi Mohammed Ibn ’Abdin, the author of a poem on the history of the Benf Al-afttas, kings of  Badajoz. (See a preceding note, p. 370.) Al-makkari (Book v. fo. 116) mentions another individual  named Mohammed Ibn ’Abdiin Al-’adiiwi Al-jebelf, an inhabitant of Cordova, who left Spain for the East  in the year three hundred and thirty-seven (a.p. 947-8), and who, having become an excellent astronomer  and physician, was appointed director of an hospital at Fustét. He returned to Spain in three hundred  and sixty (a.p. 970-1), and was much distinguished by Al-hakem II. and his son Hishém II. But these  three individuals being natives of Spain, the observation cannot be applied to them.    % Haji Khalfah (voc.

Ibn Moklah’s prophecy was speedily fulfilled, for, after a while, having been restored  “to the charge of Wizir, he entered into a correspondence with Hakem the Turk, who had been general  “of the armies of Al-kahir. Intelligence of this having reached Ibn Réyik, who then commanded the  “troops of Ar-rédhi, he accused him of treason against his sovereign, and the Khalif ordered that  “Tbn Moklah’s left hand should be cut off, and some time afterwards that his tongue should be cut  “also; he was, besides, cast into a dungeon, where he remained a long time. . But Tbn Moklah’s  “ misfortunes did not end here; he was, while in prison, attacked with dysentery, and not having  ‘at hand any one to cure him or to take care of him, he was the most wretched and miserable of  “‘men; so much so that I was told by the gaoler that, in order to drink, he was obliged to hold a  “rope between his teeth and dip it in the waters of a well inside his prison, and then suck it with  “his mouth; in one word, his sufferings were almost inexpressible until death came to relieve him  “from his misfortunes. Ibn Moklah was first buried, like other criminals, in the court of the Sultan’s  “* palace, close to the prison. After this his family implored the Khalif’s permission to disinter his  “ body, and this being granted, his remains were removed to the dwelling of his son, Abu-]-huseyn,  “‘and there buried; at last Ibn Moklah’s widow, a freedwoman of the name of Dinarivyah, had him  “‘ again disinterred and removed to her residence in the palace of Um-habib. But the most extraordinary  “ thing related of this Ibn Moklah is that, while in prison, after he had had his hand cut off, and before  “he had been deprived of his tongue, he used to write to the Khalif Ar-rdédhi, asking him for certain  “* sums of money he had promised him. His becoming lame of his right hand did not incapacitate Ibn  “« Moklah from discharging the duties of the Wizirate, for he continued to write most beautifully with his  “left hand, or by using some other contrivance unknown to any one. The fact is, that a little before  ‘his last misfortune his son received a letter from him admirably executed, and which, he said, had  “been written either with the left hand, or with a kalam fixed on the stump of the right arm. It  “has been remarked of Ibn Moklah that he served three dynasties, copied thrice the Koran, per-  “« formed three pilgrimages, and was buried the same number of times.”    ® Both the copies have peas kadhim, which means ‘ the dent or groove at the upper end of the    arrow, where the feathers are placed.’ Dagfal Ibn Handhalah (see D’Herbelot, Joco /audato,) was one of  the companions of the Prophet, although he held no traditions from his mouth. He was killed at the  battle of Doléb, by the people of 'Irék, during the Khalifate of Mu’awiyah, the first of the Beni Umeyyah.

In addition to what I have there said of this poet, I find in Ibnu  Bashkdwél that he left a collection of poems. That biographer adds that he died from the result of a  paralytic fit, with which he was struck some years before, on the 18th of Jumfda 1., a. a. three hundred  and twenty-eight (March, a. p. 940).    » This is the same individual mentioned in p. 37, and Note 31, p. 334.

T have already made several quotations from the Bibliographical Index of Kheyr Ibn Khalifah (Arab.  MS. in Bib. Esc., No. 1667), and as, in the course of these notes, I shall often have occasion to  refer to it, I shall give a description of it, together with a short analysis of its contents. It is a middle-  sized folio of about four hundred and seventy pages, written in a large, clear, Maghrebi or Western hand,  in the year seven hundred and twelve of the Hijra (a. p. 1313). The author, who flourished in the sixth  century of the Hijra, is there said to be Abi Bekr Mohammed Ibn Kheyr Ibn ’Omar Ibn Khalifah Al-  andalusi. The contents of the work are totally dissimilar to those announced by Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp.  Esc. vol. ii. p. 71). I recollect that when I first read the description of a manuscript said to contain  an account of seventy public libraries existing in the Peninsula under the Arabs, with catalogues, too,  of the works preserved in them, and the names of the authors, &c., I felt a great desire to see it,  and made a journey to the Escurial on purpose. The reader may judge of my disappointment when,  upon inspection, I found it to be a species of memorandum book, in which the author had put down  the titles of all the works he had read in the various departments of science, and the names of the masters  to whom he was indebted for his learning. At the end of the volume the writer names those doctors    -  who had given him permission to quote from their werks or their conversations, laa) al \yilo! ., sl!    he 3) and classes them under the towns of their birth in the following order: 1. those of Seville; 2.  those of Cordova; 3. Almeria; 4. Malaga; 5. Algesiras; and, 6. Granada, and other cities of Moham-  medan Spain. I need not say that there is not the least mention made in the work—which I perused  entirely, taking numerous extracts, from which I now borrow—of any public library existing in Spain,  and yet, on Casiri’s authority, this mis-statement has not only been repeated over and over again, but  has frequently been adduced as a convincing proof of the high intellectual culture of the Arabs! As  it is, the production is a very valuable one, since it gives us the titles as well as the names of the  authors of books which are sought for in vain in H4ji Khalfah’s Bibliographical Dictionary, a work  particularly deficient in the literature of the Spanish Arabs.    71 sy sled! oF Fil is, according to H4jf Khalfah, the title of a voluminous work on tradi-  tions by re! din Ibn Yatimah, whose death is not recorded in the copy in the British Museum.    72 BW r) we? elas Ad ew H4ji Khalfah gives no account of this work, which I find  mentioned by Kheyr, loco laudato.    73 The transcription of the Koran is subject among the Arabs to certain rules, defined by a particular  branch of literature, which they call ’i/mu-n-ndsikh wa-l-mansikh, (the science of the copy and the original.)    7 Abd ’Omar (al.’Amru) Ytsuf Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr is the same author mentioned at p. 37.

He died at Xativa in four hundred and sixty-three  (a.p. 1069). H4ji Khalfah (voc.

He is there said to have composed various    works on genealogy, and among others that which is here mentioned.    8 There are various authors with this name in Casiri’s Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. One is Ahmed Ibn Sa’id  Al-b4ji (vol. i. p. 466, c. 1), another Ahmed Ibn Sa’id Ibn Ibrahim Al-hamdaéni (vol. ii. p. 140, c. 1),  a third is Ahmed Ibn Said Ibn ’Alf Al-kanttari (vol. ii. p. 141, c. 1), and, lastly, the same author  mentions (vol. ii. p. 134, c. 2,) a writer called Ahmed Ibn Sa’id Ibn Hazm Al-montejili. One of the  ancestors of Ibnu Sa’id was also called Ahmed. Perhaps he is the person here alluded to, but as both  Ahmed and Sa’id are very common names among the Arabs, and the patronymic is wanting, it is impos-  sible to decide which of the above-mentioned individuals the allusion regards. H4ji Khalfah does not give  the title of this work among the histories of the companions of the Prophet.    §® Kheyr Ibn Khalifah, in his Bibliographical Index, mentions a work on traditions by Abd Ja’far  Mohammed Ibn ’Amri Ibn Misa Al-’okayli, entitled Saxe) ipo Sy sill y Tanail ‘a treatise  on those among the traditionists who erred or were guilty of omissions in their writings.’    84 Ibn Khallekén (yd.

Rain-water is often used by poets  metaphorically for beauty, and I find in Ibnu-]-athir (the author of an historical work in my possession)  that Al-mundhir, one of the ancient kings of Arabia, was also called Ibn Mdi-s-samd, owing to his  mother’s great beauty.

Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 136.    1% The work here alluded to is in the Bodl. Lib. at Oxford, No. cxxvii; it is entitled ub 5 slas es    “ the history of the K4dis of Cordova,’ and abounds with precious information of all kinds, but especially  relating to the prosperous times of the Cordovan empire. According to Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc.  vol. ii. p. 133), the author was still living in a.m. three hundred and thirty (a.p. 941-2). A fuller  description of this MS. will be given in the notes to the second volume.    121 The want of a patronymic to this name renders it somewhat difficult to know who is this writer on  genealogy. I believe that Ar-rézi is meant, for his name and surname are the same ; besides, I learn  from Al-homaydi (loco laudato, fo. 18,) that he left a work in five large volumes on the genealogy of  the principal Arabian families who settled in Andalus,    122 Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 139, c. 1,) mentions this author, whom he calls Cassemus Ben  Ahmad Ben Sabeghus. Al-makkari treats likewise of him in the fifth part of the second book, fo. 102.  The two works here attributed to Ibn Asbagh are in the catalogue of his writings given by Adh-dhobi  (Ar. MS. in the Nat. Lib. Mad., Gg. 14); one is L593] WolS (the book of the genealogies), in five  volumes, which Casiri translated by Etymologiarum Libri v.; the other is said to be a history of Spain  under the Sultans of the family of Umeyyah.

The reason of this expression I imagine to be, that as the  number of volumes in an Arabic work depends in some manner upon the scribe or his employer, it would  be impossible to fix the number of volumes which a work ought to have. In the present case all the  copies read Nix pe = AP ‘in nearly ten volumes ;’ but as this work of Ibnu Hayy4n has been    said elsewhere to have been composed of fifty or sixty volumes (see p. 147), I rather think the statement  must be an erroneous one. However, the history here mentioned might not be the Al-matin, but the  Muktabis, which is really composed of ten volumes. See above, pp. 338, 425.   Tbnu Hayyé4n, as I have stated elsewhere (Note 3, p. 310), died in a.m. four hundred and sixty-nine  (a.p. 1076). He was therefore a contemporary of Ibn Hazm, whose death happened in four hundred  and fifty-six (a.p. 1064).    '% Among the works which Ibnu-]-khattfb, in the preface to his history of Granada, speaks of  having consulted, is a history of Elvira, by Abi-l-k4sim Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-wahed Al-gh4feki  Al-malimi, or Al-malléhi, (for in my copy this word is not distinctly written.)

He must have been a contemporary of the author of the epistle.    18 This Ahmed Ibn Faraj appears to be the same author mentioned in Note 110, p. 443.    181 The life of this physician has been given separately in the Appendix A., p. xxiii., translated from Ibn  Abi Ossaybi’ah.    182 Ton Abj Ossaybi’ah (oco laudato, fo. 136,) gives the life of this physician in the following terms :—  “ Yahya Ibn Is’hék was an eminent and experienced physician; he excelled above all in the knowledge of  “* medicines, and was a very skilful practitioner. He lived under ’Abdu-r-rahmén III., who appointed him  “ his Wizir, and gave him important commands in the army and the provinces, naming him to the  “ government of Badajoz, which he filled for some time. He was very much beloved by that Sultan,  ** who placed great confidence in him. Yahya compiled a very excellent work on the simples used in  “« medicine, divided into five books, in which he treated the subject according to the doctrines of the  “« Greek physicians, which were then generally in use among the Christians ; for although Yahya himeelf  “« was a Moslem, his father Is‘h&k had been a Christian.”    133 Ibn Abi Ossaybi’ah (/oco laudato, fo. 136, verso,) gives the life of this physician, who flourished  under Al-manstr Ibn Abf ’A’mir, and was employed in his household. Al-homaydi, (Ar. MS. in the  Bod].

Tasrif’) says that he died after four hundred of the Hijra, which is more likely. This is the same Arabian  physician so well known during the middle ages by the names of Abbucasis, Bucasis Galaf, Azaragi, &c.,  and whose works were translated into Latin, and published in 1519 and 1532.    1% According to Ibn Abi Ossaybi’ah (loco laudato, fo. 137), ’Abdu-r-rahm&n Ibn Is‘h&k Ibnu-]-haytham  was one of the most eminent Andalusian physicians. He lived at Cordova, where he gained great  celebrity by his practice as well as by his writings. He flourished towards the end of the fourth century  of the Hijra, and wrote several works on the science of medicine and the knowledge of simples. In the  list of these his biographer gives the title of one called pobel WIS ‘the book of poisonous sub-  stances.’    ‘8 If I am not mistaken this is the name of a mathematician who flourished during the reign of  Al-hakem Al-mustanser-billah, and whom Conde erroneously calls Said Ben Fahlon.

According to Ibn Ab{f Ossaybi’ah, who gives his life, Moslemah died in Cordova in three  hundred and ‘ninety-eight (a.p. 1007-8). He is farther said to have translated the Almagest of Ptolemy  into Arabic, and to have constructed some excellent astronomical tables.    4 Tbnu-s-samah or Ibnu Samh is the same individual mentioned at p. 149, and p. 428, Note 40,  under the name of Abi-l-késim Asbagh Ibnu-s-samh.     Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. i. p: 446) mentions an eminent theologian named Khalil Ibn Is’hak,  who was the author of numerous works on theology and jurisprudence, since the Escurial Library contains  no less than ten volumes of his different compositions. But unless Casiri made a mistake he cannot  be the same author here alluded to, since that author places his death in seven hundred and seventy-six of  the Hijra (a.p. 1374-5), that is, nearly two centuries after the death of Ibn Hazm.   I have already observed elsewhere (see p. 445) that the author of this epistle, Ibn Hazm, pro-  fessed the religious opinions of the Dhéherites. It is thus stated by Ibn Khallekén (Zyd. Ind., No.  459), who says that in his youth he followed the sect of Shafi’, but that he afterwards left it, and  adopted that of Adh-dhéherf. It would even appear that Ibn Hazm, whose reputation for learning and  virtue seems to have been very great among his countrymen, made some reform or innovation, since   VOL. I. 30",535,,

It is therefore not to be wondered at that various inconsistencies are remarked now and then,  which must necessarily be the mistakes of copyists. For instance: Mohammed Ibn ’Omar Ibn Lub4beh,  or Lub4bah, is here mentioned as if previous notice had been taken of him, whereas it is Mohammed Ibn  Yahya Ibn ’Omar Ibn Lubébah, the author of the Muntekhab, who has been named at p. 183. However,  this Mohammed Ibn ’Omar, who, according to Al-homaydi (loco laudato, fo. 33), was the uncle of the  Mohammed Ibn Yahya Ibn Lub4&bah mentioned at p. 183, died in three hundred and fourteen of the  Hijra (a. p. 926-7). Ibn Khallekén (Tyd. Ind., No. 582,) gives the life of a celebrated theologian  named Abu ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakam Al-misri, who died in two hundred and sixty-eight  (a.p. 881-2). He seems to be the same Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakem who wrote a history of Egypt, and who is so  often quoted by Makrizi, As-soyutti, and other Egyptian historians.    16 T have already observed (Note 52, p. 454) that there is in the Escurial Library a work on jurispru-  dence by a certain Mohammed Ibn Sahniin. I doubt, however, his being the same person here alluded  to, since it is evident that Ibn Hazm speaks of a writer born out of Spain, and who most likely never  resided in it.    187 The same observation may be applied to this individual, whom my copy calls simply Ibn ’Abdis, as  in p. 178; but who in all others is named Mohammed Ibn ’Abdis. If such be the case, he cannot be  identified as I imagined (Note 51, p. 454) with the Sa’id Ibn ’Abdiis mentioned by Conde. Al-ho-  maydi, in his Jadh’watu-l-muktabis, gives the life of a writer whose name was Mohammed Ibn ’Abdis Ibn  Masarrah ; but without further proof it is almost impossible to decide in such matters.    185 No previous mention has been made of this poet, as the author seems to imply, whence I conclude  that in transcribing this epistle from Ibnu Sa’id’s work, Al-makkari missed or suppressed some passage.    The patronymic ok I Ar-riyéhi is common to Spanish Arabs. Ibn Khallekén, in the life of Abu    Bekr Mohammed Az-zubeydi (Tyd.

'5 T have already stated (see a preceding Note, p. 425,) that the large historical work composed by the  Sultan of Badajoz was known in the East by the title of Al-mudhdhafert, from the name of its royal author.  No portion of this work,—which, to judge from the number of volumes of which it is said to have been  composed, and from the subjects treated in it, must have been highly interesting,—is, to my knowledge,  preserved in any of the public libraries of Europe. It is likely that it perished during the civil wars  which distracted Spain in the fifth century of the Hijra, and caused the dissolution of the kingdom of  Badajoz, together with the death of the last princes of the family of Al-afttas.

That the historian named by H4ji Khalfah is the same individual alluded to by Ibnu Sa’fd, and who is  so frequently quoted by the author of the Karttés, by Ibnu Khaldin, and other African writers, cannot  for a moment be doubted; but his names and surnames are not entirely ascertained, for, although  the Bodleian Library at Oxford possesses the second volume of the historical work here mentioned, and the  author’s name is said at the end to be 'Abdu-l-malek Ibn Mohammed Ibn Séhibi-s-salat Al-b4ji (from  Beja), I have reasons, which I shall give elsewhere, for doubting that statement.   Conde has occasionally mentioned this writer in his work, especially in the second volume, which is an  unfaithful and rambling version of the Karttds ; but he seems not to have understood the meaning of the  words Ibn Sdhibu-s-saldt, which he translates at times by El autor del Salat (see vol. ii. p. 250), and at  others by El autor del libro de los Principes. (See ibid., p. 254.) Neither has M. Fluegel, in his translation  of Héji Khalfah, which is in course of publication (see vol. ii. p. 153), seized the meaning of those  words ; since, mistaking §{o saldt, ‘ public prayer,’ for dLo silah, ‘joining,’ the title of an historical dic-  tionary by Ibnu Bashkiwél, he has translated the words Ibn Sdhibi-s-saldt by ‘filius auctoris operis  Silet.’    7 Haji Khalfah, who, as I have observed elsewhere, consulted Ibnu Sa’d’s writings, transcribes this  passage, but gives no further information as to the title and number of volumes which composed the  work. The author’s entire name was Abi Bekr Yahya Ibn Mohammed; he was a native of Granada,  according to Ibnu-l-khattib, and died in that city in 570, not in 557, as Héji Khalfah erroneously states.  Kheyr Ibn Khalifah, the author of a Bibliographical Index already described, gives the title of this history  as follows : hb J i, ghel AP ie! pt wl ‘the shining stars on the history of the    Almoravides.    18 By “second civil war” the Andalusian writers mean the long period of war between the Almoravides  and Almohades.

Lib. (Hunt. 464). It is a  folio of about four hundred pages, handsomely written in a plain Maghrebi hand towards the beginning  of the fifteenth century of our era. A note at the end states that it was composed by Al-homaydi  during his stay in the country of ’Irék. Its contents seem to me to be different from those of the work  of Ibnu Hayy4n, of which it is said to be an epitome ; they are the lives of illustrious men born in Spain,  divided into ten parts, while the work of the former, if I am to judge from the volume preserved in  the same library, is a chronological history of Spain.   Al-homaydi, whose entire name was Abii ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Abi Nasr Fatih Ibn ’Abdillah  Al-azdi, was a native of the island of Mallorca. He travelled to the East, and died at Baghdéd in  a.H. 488. His life may be read in Ibn Khallekén, Tyd. Ind., No. 627, and Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp.

[Book 1.    dele Fad no ‘the history of Sa’id.’ It is a volume in small folio, containing little more than two    hundred pages, written in a very clear neskhé hand upon coarse brown paper, but the occasional want of  diacritical points makes the reading rather difficult. It begins with an account of the prophets who  preceded Mohammed; it then gives the life of the latter, together with a description of his wives,  freedmen, secretaries, servants, slaves, horses, mules, weapons, &c.; it proceeds then to give the  narrative of his conquests. At fo. 69 the author introduces a compendious history of the Khalifs of the  house of Umeyyah who reigned in Spain. At fo. 80 he gives that of the Khalifs of the house of ’“Abb4s  who reigned in the East ; the volume ending in six hundred and twenty-eight (a.p. 1230-1), under the  reign of Al-mustanser-billah. It is hardly necessary to remark that the above work has nothing in  common with the Tabakdt written by the Kadi of Toledo, an author who preceded him by nearly two  centuries.    27 Héji Khalfah gives the title of this work differently ; he says, wy ell J rl dail)    = 3 ‘the object and the end towards the knowledge of the genealogy of Arabs and foreigners,’ by    Yusuf Ibn ’Abdillah, known by the surname of Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr the Héfedh, a native of Cordova, who  died in four hundred and sixty-three of the Hijra (a.p. 1070-1). But, immediately after the said title,  follows that which is here given, but which is there attributed to Mohammed Ibn Ayub Ibn Ghalib  Al-anséri. Mistakes of this kind abound in the work of H4ji Khalfah, who was but slightly acquainted  with the literature of Mohammedan Spain.    8 Héji Khalfah makes no mention of this abridgment among those of Tabari’s chronicle. Gharib Ibn  Sa’id appears to be the same author whom Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. i. pp. 273, 324,) calls  Garibay Ben Said, seu Saad. He wrote a work on medicine which is in the Escurial Library (see Cat.,  No. 883), and was a Kdtib to ’Abdu-r-rahmén III., Sultan of Cordova.    2% | find this title differently written in the various copies.

Yahya Ibnu-l-hakem, surnamed Al-gha4zél, was a distinguished poet of the court of ’Abdu-r-  rahmén JIL, Sultén of Cordova, who sent him on several embassies to the monarchs of Europe, and to  the Emperor of Constantinople. He died in two hundred and fifty of the Hijra (a. p. 864). See Conde  (Hist. de la Dom. vol. i. p. 294), who calls him erroneously Al-gazali.    ® Al-fat'h Ibn Khékén died in Morocco in five hundred and thirty-five (a. p. 1140-41). See Note 39,  p. 840. Tbnu Sa’fd was born in six hundred and ten (a.p. 1213-4), which gives seventy-five years’  difference between the death of the former and the birth of the latter. The expression, therefore, is  incorrect, unless Ibnu Sa’fd quotes the words of his own father, also an historian, as we shall  presently see.    3 T have given elsewhere the title of this work as it is written in a copy of it preserved in the British    Museum (see Preface, and Note 39, p. 339), namely, (Jn! e Ag ailill ces nul om  Use This title, however, is differently written by the various authors I have consulted.

Crit. exhib. locos Ibn Khakanis, Lugd. Batav. 1831, has chosen  the reading as given by Ibn Khallekén, but I believe the above to be more correct.   This celebrated production of Al-fat'h, so much esteemed by Eastern scholars and so often quoted and  alluded to by Andalusian writers, is by no means so common as his Kaldyidu-l.’ikiydn, copies of which  are easily met with. I know, indeed, of no other copy than that preserved in the library of the British  Museum, and that is so incorrect, and so badly written, as to be almost unintelligible. The contents  of the work are the lives of the illustrious poets who lived in Al-fat’h’s time, accompanied with numerous  extracts from their verses, and a few interesting anecdotes, the whole being written in that inflated and  metaphorical style so much to the taste of Arabian writers, but which to the European scholar is of little  or no use, since it is but seldom that the difficulties he has to encounter at every step are compensated  by the information to be derived from works of this description. The Mattmah is divided into four books  or sections: the first contains the lives of Sulténs and chiefs, seven in number; the second those of  Wizirs, in all thirty-seven ; the third those of twenty-three doctors and faquihs; and the fourth those of  twenty-four poets and literati not belonging to either of the above classes. So not only is the general  distribution of the Mattmah similar to that of the Kaldyid (see Note 39, p. 339), but its contents are in  many instances the same, for it is not uncommon to find upon collation several pages of the Kaldyid  agreeing exactly with those of the Mattmah; in short, the only difference seems to be this,—that the  Mattmah, which is undoubtedly a posterior work, contains more lives than the Kaldyid. This, perhaps,  explains why H4ji Khalfah (voc. Mattmah), Ibn Khallekén (Tyd. Ind., No. 536), and Ibnu Sa’id, mention  different editions of the same work, since the Kaldyid might well be only an epitome of a larger work  resembling the Mattmah.   The copy in the British Museum (No. 9580) is a small octavo of about two hundred pages; the  transcript is modern, and badly executed, and what is still worse, swarms with blunders, so that it is  almost impossible to peruse it without the assistance of a better one. It is marked wrong in the  Catalogue of Additions for 1833, where the title is said to be Kaldyidu-l-’ikiydn instead of Mattmahu-I-    anfus.",545,,

The authority of a bibliographer, so accurate as Haji  Khalfah generally is, would have induced me to doubt whether the titles given by him were not those of  two distinct works written by different authors, had I not found in Al-makkari himself (fo. 310) a long  disquisition on the merits and contents of the Mas‘hab, as likewise on the meaning of that word, which  he says may be pronounced Al-mis'hab or Al-mas‘hab, and means ‘he who is always speaking, a gos-    siping man.’ pi pl Pp cool  It is therefore very probable that H4ji Khalfah, to whom the work of Ibnu Sa’id was known, and who,  as I have often stated, copied almost literally the bibliographical information contained in the present    epistle, saw a copy in which the words uj) and ws ise! were written Wp!) and sje!    —a mistake which is of frequent occurrence among copyists, and with which I have often been troubled  even in the course of this translation.    37 Of ’Abdu-l-mélik Ibn Sa’id I have treated, p. 440, Note 107; but, in order to make what follows  more intelligible, I have thought it necessary to translate the following passage from Part 1. Book v. fo.  142, verso, where part of the preface and considerable extracts from the work of his grandson Ibnu Sa’id are  given by Al-makkari :—‘‘ The present work (the Mughrib) was begun in the year five hundred and thirty  (a. p. 1135-6), and continued until the new moon of the year six hundred and forty-one (a.p. 1243-4).  “The principal cause of its being written was my great grandfather ’Abdu-l-malik Ibn Sa’id, Lord of  «« Alcalé, a fortress which he received as a fief from ’Alf Ibn Yusuf Ibn Tashfin, Prince of the Moslems,  “and King of the Berbers; and which he held, defending it in the year 539 against the Almohades.  «The Hafedh of Andalus, Abi Mohammed ‘Abdullah Ibn Ibrahim Ibnu-1-hijari, happened to pass in the  “ year 530 near the castle of the Beni Sa’id, and having been hospitably received and entertained by my  “* great grandfather, he, in the course of time, wrote and dedicated to him his great historical work called  « Al-mas'hab fi ghardyibi-l-maghreb, composed of about six volumes, in which he collected the history of  “ Andalus from the time of the conquest up to the year in which he commenced his task, (that is, the  “ year 530.) After this, it came into the mind of my great grandfather ’Abdu-l-mélik to add to the  “‘ said work the history of events which had escaped the author’s observation: this he did, with the",546,,

Then came my father Miisa, who certainly  “ was the most learned and experienced of all my ancestors in these matters, and the one who showed  “the greatest ardour in collecting information for his book, as will be proved by the following anecdote :  “While we were staying at Algesiras, which city my father governed for some time by the appointment  “of Ibn Hud, Sultén of Andalus, I informed him that an illustrious inhabitant of that place possessed  “some quires of paper containing poetical and other extracts composed by poets of Algesiras, as well as  “the history of its governors and principal men during the dynasty of the Beni ’Abdu-l-mtimen. My  “* father sent immediately to ask him for the loan of the book, but this the man, who was both an ignorant  “and a fool, refused, saying, ‘ I swear to Allah that this book shall never go out of my house,’ adding,  “ ¢if the governor wants it, let him come himself and ask me for it.’ When the answer was brought to  “my father, he burst into a laugh, and turning towards me said, ‘ Let us go to the man.’ ‘ And who  ‘is he?’ said I, ‘ for us to go to his house in the manner described.’ Then my father said, ‘ Certainly  “I should not do this for the sake of the man himself, but I shall do it for the honour of the illustrious  ‘men whose verses and biographies are contained in that volume. Dost thou think that if they were  ‘all alive, and collected in one spot, I would hesitate in going to them? Certainly not.’ We went  “« immediately to the man’s house, who, by Allah! not only did not come half way to meet us on  “‘ our approach, as is the custom between well-bred gentlemen, but remained where he was. When my  “‘ father had expressed his wish, the man lent him his book, and we retired, after returning him thanks  “for it. It has been said of my father Musa, that out of sixty-seven veara, which made the duration of  “« his life, he passed not one day without reading or writing.”    % The titles of this work, as I find them in this passage, are oe spin) wt ws Go and  wa catty ro) rel Instead of _J> ry Haji Khalfuh writes sometimes vel, kl 3 (see Turikh  Maghreb, and at others dal leo AP (see Maghreb).

His life is in Ibn Khallekan, Tyd. Ind.,  No. 46. A copy of these poems is in the Bodl. Lib., No. 324.

He is there said to have written an excellent com-  mentary on the grammatical work of Sibauyeh, but this being mentioned a few lines lower down, the  work here intended must be a commentary on the ve! WIS Kitdbu-l-jumal, by Abi-l-késim Az-  zajaji, which I find likewise in the list of his works. Ibnu-l-kharif died in 609 or 610.    “ It is not clear from the text whether the patronymic Ar-rondi (of Ronda) is to be joined to Ibn  Kharif’s name, and applied to him, or to be read separately, as being that of another grammarian. I find  that Ibn Kharif’s patronymic was Al-ishbili (from Seville), but he might be born in Ronda, and yet  denominate himself after the place of his residence.   If, however, Ar-rondi be meant for the patronymic of another grammarian, it may be applied to ‘Isa  Ibn Suleyman Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn ’Abdillah Ar-ro’ayni Ar-rondi, whom I find mentioned by Al-  makkari (Part 1. Book v. fo. 150) among those illustrious Moslems who left Spain to travel to the East,  or else that of Omar Ibn ’Abdi-l-majid Al-azdi Ar-rondi, an eminent grammarian, who died, according to  Tbna-l-khattib, quoted by Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 109), in a.m. six hundred and six  (a.p. 1219).    #® Abi-l-hasan ‘Ali Ibn Mimen Ton yy tae ’Osfiir, (the son of the sparrow,) was a native of    Seville.

He was at the  court of Al-’édil in a. #. 613. His life may be read in Ibn Abf ’Ossaybi’ah, fo. 148, verso.    % The author here mentioned under the name of Abi Mohammed Al-mélaki (from Malaga) is the  celebrated naturalist ‘Abdullah Ibn Ahmed, surnamed Ibnu-]-beyttar, (see a preceding note, p. 431,)  who was contemporary with Ibnu Sa’id, since he died in six hundred and forty-six of the Hijra (a.p.  1248). The work here alluded to is undoubtedly his dictionary of simples used as medicaments, entitled  Ws! o stl Wis —of which I possess a splendid and very ancient copy in two thick volumes,    in folio.    5 Al-ghéfeki is the patronymic of an eminent Andalusian physician, often quoted by Ibnu-l-beyttar and  other naturalists. His entire name was, according to Ibn Abi 'Ossaybi’ah (loco laudato, fo. 189), Abi  Ja'far.    % There can be no doubt that the author here mentioned is the famous geographer, generally known  by the name of Idris{. I find him frequently quoted by Ibnu-l-beyttar, as well as by Ibn Abi ’Ossaybi’ah  (fo. 139, verso), who speaks of him in the following words :—‘* The Sherif Mohammed Ibn Mohammed  “ Al-hasani, whose entire name was Abii ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah, of the    “ posterity of Idris Al-hasan{, surnamed aL, al Al-’ali-billah, was very learned in the knowledge of    “ simples, and their properties and use in medicine. He left a treatise on the subject.” However, as  neither Ibna-l-beyttar nor Ibn Abi ’Ossaybi’ah give the title of Idrisi’s work, I conclude that he was not  a physician, but was comprised in that category merely from the fact of his mentioning occasionally in his  Geography facts connected with natural history. The same might be said of Abi ’Obeyd Al-bekri, whom  the Arabian geographer counts likewise among the physicians of Spain:    57 All the copies consulted by me read ’Abdu-l-mdmen, son of Almansir ; which must be a mistake of  the author, since it is every where repeated. ‘Abdu-l-mimen was not the son but the grandfather of  Ya’kub, the only sovereign of the Almohades who assumed the title of Al-mansur bi fadhli-lah (i.e. the  victorious by the grace of God). Besides, as may be seen in the Appendix A., p. xix., Abu-l-walid  was cast into prison in the year 595 or thereabout, that is to say, nearly twenty years after the death  of ’Abdu-l-mtimen. There can therefore be no doubt that for gyondl ww pe) duc as in the    text, wo yl oe Ae we pyedl ought to be substituted, i. e. ‘ Almansiir, one of the Benf ’Abdu-l-    mimen.’ The name of this author, Ibn Habib, is not among those of the learned men imprisoned by  Al-mansir.

From the peculiar syntax of the Arabic language,  they may mean either filius Zeidi, episcopi Cordubensis, or filius Zeidi, episcopus Cordubensis : the former  is most probable. There might have been a Bishop of Cordova who was converted to Islam, and who  received the Arabian name ‘ Zeyd;’ the son of whom might well have been a writer on astrology,  while it cannot be presumed that a Christian bishop, residing in Cordova, would take the name of  ‘Ibn Zeyd,’ and much less that he was the son of a Mohammedan called Zeyd. Again, the word  askaf, which admits of no other interpretation in Arabic but that of ‘bishop,’ might be a nickname  given to Ibn Zeyd by his countrymen, owing to some circumstance unknown to me. However, be  this as it may, it will be shown in the course of these notes, that during the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahman III.,  and other enlightened sovereigns of the house of Umeyyah, the Christians of Cordova were admitted to  fill posts of honour and trust in the civil administration, as well as in the armies of the Khalif.

It is well known that the Roman Era  instituted by Augustus, and which began thirty-eight years before Christ, was, until the fourteenth  century, the only standard of computation for the Spanish historians; and as to the four cities said to  have been founded by Augustus, if we except Seville, (built by Julius Cesar, as the author himeelf has  stated elsewhere, see p. 55,) the other three, viz. Merida (Emerita), Saragossa (Cesarea- Augusta), and  Cordova (Cortuba Colonia Patricia), owe either their foundation or their re-establishment to that Roman  emperor.    4 By ‘the sons of ’Ayssu’ the Vandals are undoubtedly intended, for many of the Arabian historians  believe them to be of a common origin with the Romans. ‘Ayssu or Esau, they say, had a son called  Ram, from whom all the Greek and Roman emperors were descended.

I have, on the contrary, offered on every occasion a most literal version; thus pre-  ferring to be accused of quaintness rather than of altering the signification, which in most instances it is  extremely difficult to seize: the titles of Arabic books, indeed, are of the most fantastic kind; and it is  but seldom that they have any connexion at all with the subject of the work. Thus, for instance, the  chronology of the Sulténs of Africa and Spain, by Ibnu-l-khattfb, bears the appellation of ‘ silken vest  embroidered with the needle ;’ a biography of Spanish Doctors, famous for their piety and learning, is  entitled ‘ fragrant plants ;’ and a treatise on constancy of mind, ‘ approved butter.’ This contagion seems  to have passed from the Arabs to the Spaniards, since almost all the collections of romances and other  poems printed in Snain during the sixteenth century bear some such title as ‘ Ramillete de flores amenas’  (nosegay of sweet smelling flowers); ‘ Primavera y flor de Romances’ (spring and flower of Romances) ;  ‘ Cristales puros y fuentes claras’ (transparent crystals and limpid fountains) ; lastly, a Spanish writer of  the sixteenth century published in 1554, at Antwerp, a work entitled ‘ Libro de caballeria celestial del pie  de la rosa fragante’ (the book of celestial chivalry from the foot of the fragrant rose bush).   Most of the cities here mentioned preserve their Arabic names. Bolkinah, a corruption of Obulco,  6 Bovdxey of Strabo, and the Municipium Pontificense of Pliny, is now Porcuna; Al-kosseyr (the small  castle) is the present Alcozer; Al-mudowdr, which I find also written Al-mudawar and Almudawwar, is  Almodovar del Rio, the ancient Carbula; Mordd, or Moréd, as it ought to be pronounced, can be no  other than Morente, a small town in the province of Cordova; Kozaah is evidently the small village  now called Cuzna.

The Spanish word rauda, which is derived from it, has the same  meaning. My copy reads simply rabadhu-r-raudhah, ‘ the suburb of the gardens or cemetery.’ The word  rabadh has likewise passed into the Spanish arrabal.    18 Saldr pu is written thus in every manuscript.

Albukhera or albufera, from § .<) bubeyrak (a small  sea), means ‘a lake;’ alberca, ‘a tank’ or ‘ pond,’ comes from wy berkah, which means the same in  Arabic; safareche, ‘ a reservoir or place where water is kept for the purpose of irrigation,’ from a hee  sahdrij (a cistern). Indeed, almost all words in the Spanish language meaning a receptacle for water,  whether for drinking or for agricultural purposes, will be found to be derived from the Arabic: aljibe is  ‘a well,’ from > al-jib or al-j(b; alcubilla, ‘ a small building in the shape of a dome built over a  place where water is found,’ comes from kaa! al-kubiyah, meaning ‘a small cupola or kiosque;’  raudal, ‘any stream or volume of water whatever,’ is from Ady, raudhah ; azuda, ‘a dam con-  >  structed in a river or mill,’ from y, sudd, a ‘ wall,’ an ‘ obstruction ;’ azeguia, ‘a canal for irri-  gation,’ from X5\..J] as-sdkiyah, which means the same; azefia, ‘a sort of water wheel,’ from ilu!  as-sdniyah, which means ‘a camel employed in carrying water for irrigation ;’ anoria, ‘a Persian  3   wheel,’ from 3, xe) an-nd’irah, and many other of the same sort.   25 Theodofred, Duke of Cordova, and father of the King Roderic, is said by Ambrosio Morales    (Cronica General, vol. iii. fo. 197,) to have been the builder of this palace, the ruins of which were still  visible in the days of the author about two miles from Cordova, in the midst of a field called Casa-",557,,

See Conde, Hist. de la Dom. vol. i. p. 342, et passim.    27 There must be here some mistake. Narbonne was retaken by the Franks in 797 of our Era, under  the reign of Al-hakem I., the grandfather of Mohammed; and from that moment it never afterwards  made part of the Moslem dominions. Perhaps the author means Hishém, who not only stormed that  city, plundered, and set it on fire, but obliged the inhabitants to furnish him with materials for the  construction of the great mosque at Cordova.    28 Mohammed I., son of ’Abdu-r-rahmén II., and the fourth among the Sulténs of Cordova of the  family of Umeyyah.    2 This was Mohammed Ibn Hish4m Ibn ’Abdi-1-jabbér, surnamed Al-mahdt-billah, who usurped the royal  power in Cordova after the death of “Abdu-r-rahmén, son of Al-mansiir, in the year three hundred and  ninety-nine of the Hijra (a.p. 1009).    8° Mr. Shakespear has constantly translated ue) Toman by ‘ peach;’ when it is notorious that this  word means ‘a pomegranate.’ The sort of fruit here described is to this day called in Spain granada zafari,  and considered the best of its kind. Spaniards also call ensalada romana a sort of salad with which the  grains of the pomegranate are mixed. In the description which the author of the Karttds gives of the  agricultural productions round Fez he mentions, among other fruits, this sort of pomegranate. See the  translation by José Antonio Moura, Lisboa, 1828, p. 43.    51 In the partition of lands made by the Amir Husém Ibn Dhirér Al-kelbi in a.m. one hundred and  twenty-two (a.p. 740), the city of Malaga and the neighbouring districts fell to the lot of the Arabs of  Al-urd&n (that part of Palestine watered by the Jordan) and to the people of Ray or Rayya (a district of  Persia), whence the name of Raya, afterwards given to Malaga, is most likely derived. See Conde,  Hist. de la Dom, vol. i. p. 110, and a preceding note, p. 356.    2 The origin of this fruit is differently related in the treatise on agriculture by Ibnu-l-awim. It is  said there that the pomegranate called _¢ 0 sha’ri (that is, hairy,) came from Baghdad or from  Medina, and was sent as a present to ’Abdu-r-rahmin I. by his sister, then residing in the East; that it  was called “s. + pws safrf, or the traveller, owing to this circumstance. (See the Spanish translation by  Banqueri, Madrid, 1802, vol. i. p. 274.) However, although the introduction of a particular species of",558,,
"    CHAP. 1.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 489    pomegranate may be owed to the Arabs, as here asserted, it is probable that the fruit existed already in  Spain, since Isidorus Pacensis, who lived in the beginning of the eighth century, compares the Peninsula to  a pomegranate, “‘ ut diceres, augustalem esse malo-granatum.” (See Florez, Esp. Sag. vol. vii. sect. 60.)  The author inserts here a poem which I have omitted, by Ahmed Ibn ra 1 Dauh, describing this fruit.    3 Hishém Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, grandfather of ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ad-dékhel I., Sultén of Cordova, built,  not far from his capital, Damascus, a pleasure-house surrounded by gardens, to which he gave the name  of Rissdfah, or, according to other writers, Russdfah.    se  oe r Le ye might mean also ‘ the palace of the stupified or struck with amazement.’    3S Abi Yahya was governor of Cordova during the reign of his father, Yusuf Abd Ya’kdb, the  second Sultén of the Almohades.

Ac-  cording to Ibnu-l-abbér, who gives a short description of it, it was one of the most magnificent country  residences that were to be seen in the outskirts of Cordova. The gardens by which it was surrounded  were very tastefully laid out, with grottos, marble walks, running fountains, &c.    % Zubeyr Ibn ’Omar Al-mulaththam governed Cordova for a short time during the absence of  Abu-l-hasan ’Alj, Sultan of the Almoravides.

According to Ibnu-l-khattib these gardens gave  their name to a certain quarter of Cordova called Jahatu-n-nd’irah.'

A portion of the kassidah, to which Al-makkari refers his readers, has been given by Ibn Khakén in  his Kaldyidu-l-’ikiydn, at the life of the Wizir Ibn Zeydtin, and translated by the above-mentioned eminent  German scholar, who has added numerous notes and illustrations bespeaking the most exquisite erudition.    o pail &. _ye—Merj is a green field, a piece of ground covered with grass.

I have translated them all, but the unusual length of some, and the little connexion they  all have with the principal object of this work, (for no historical fact is to be gained by their perusal,) have  prevented me from inserting them here; they may perhaps find a place in a work which I think of giving  to the press at a future time on the poetry of the Arabs, viewed in connexion with the popular poetry of  Spain. I shall, therefore, merely give here the names of the authors of the said poems: Kasim Ibn  *Abiid Ar-riyéhi; Mdsa Ibn ‘’Abdi-l-mélik Ibn Sa’fd, and Ja’far Ibn ’Abdi-l-mélik Ibn Sa’fd, the father  and uncle of Abu-l-hasan Ibn Sa’id (see Note 107, p. 440, and Note 37, p. 476); the Sherif po! Al-    assam, of Cordova; Abi Sheybah, of Malaga; the Wizir Ibn Zeydiin; Abu-l-hasan Al-merini; the  Wizir Aba Bekr Ibnu-l-kobtornah (see Casiri, vol. i. p. 105); the Wizir Abu-l-huseyn Ibnu-s-serr§j,  &e. &e. .   # The Guadalquivir was, until practically observed at the beginning of this century, believed to have its  rise in the same spring as the Segura. Owing to this circumstance the poets of Mohammedan Spain    elegantly call the Guadalquivir % y en sly fasted * the uterine brother of the river Segura.’    4 Probably the bridge, though begun under As-samh Ibn Mélik Al-khaulini, was not completed until  the times of ’Abdu-r-rahmfn, who succeeded him soon afterwards; the former having been killed in  battle with the Franks.

There are other  “* cabins for the use of the crew, who generally keep their children in them.”   The word masariyah means now, on the coast of Barbary, a slightly constructed room in one side of the  house, a sort of a ground floor where the Moors receive their guests, transact business, or lodge un-  married men; it is called also yd ye déru-dh-dheyfdn, or ‘the apartment of the guests.’ The  word masari has been preserved in the dialect spoken in the Balearic Islands, which is the Lemosine or  Provengal, and is used to designate a study or cabinet on the ground floor.    5 My copy reads ‘ eighty-two thousand four hundred and fifty-five.’ The word which I have translated  lower down by ‘ markets’ is oy suk or sok, whence the Spanish zocco. It was then customary, and it  is so now in Spain, to give that name to any narrow street lined on both sides by the shops of dealers in a  particular trade. What we now call market-place was then called alfondék, a word which the Spaniards  corrupted first into alfondica, and thence into alhondiga. The fonddk (whence the Italian fondaco and  the Spanish fonda) was, properly speaking, a large inn, a caravansary, where the foreign traders were  accommodated with rooms to dwell in, as well as with a suitable place to exhibit their goods for sale.    57 It was during the glorious reign of ’Abdu-r-rahmfn III., and more especially under that of his  grandson, Hishfém II., that the capital of Mohammedan Spain reached the highest degree of splendour  and magnificence.    58 Instead of ‘ eight hundred and thirty-seven mosques,’ both my copy and the epitome read ‘three  thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven,’ while the principal MS. reads distinctly ‘three hundred thousand  eight hundred and thirty-eeven!’ I have not hesitated in reducing their number as above, especially when  I find the eight hundred and thirty-seven recorded in a description of the city of Cordova, written in  Spanish, but with Arabic letters, in the year 1462, by an Aragonian Moor, named Mohammed, fijo de Ali,  Sijo de Isaac, el ballestero (Mohammed, son of ’Alf, son of Is'h&k, the maker of cross-bows). I shall  hereafter give a more detailed account of this manuscript.    © The number of houses which Cordova is said to have contained during the prosperous times of the  Khalifate, may at first sight appear rather hyperbolical; but if we consider the mode of living of the  Mohammedans, among whom each family always occupies an entire house, however small it may be; if  we reflect that Arabs even from Damascus, Baghd4d, and other great capitals of the East, who travelled  to Spain, all bore testimony to the extraordinary size and extent of Cordova during the Khalifate, (see  Ibn Hatikal’s Geography, Arab. MS. in the Bodl. Lib., No. 963, fo. 87, et passim ;) we may safely adopt  Ibnu Sa’id’s computation as that which is nearest the truth. Besides, it is probable that the number of  ‘ fifty-six thousand,’ fixed for palaces and residences of public officers and people of distinction, includes all  the houses in Cordova built of masonry, and that all the remaining were mostly barracks, tents, wooden  houses, &c. It is well known that Al-mansur, as well to serve his ambitious views as to push on his  conquests against the Christians, made considerable drafts and recruited his armies from the opposite coast  of Africa, and that at one time the outskirts of Cordova were covered with the dowdrs or encampments of  the Senhajah, Zenétah, Masmidah, Gomérah, and other African tribes. :    © Again, instead of ‘seven hundred,’ I read ‘ seventeen hundred mosques’ in the principal MS. ; but  to judge by what precedes as well as by what follows, the former must have been the number intended.",562,,
"    CHAP. I1.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 493    The number of mosques which Cordova is said to have contained cannot be much exaggerated. In  that of the baths there might be an error, and perhaps rot ‘seven’ is to be read instead of es nine.’  Marmol Carvajal, who visited Fez in the sixteenth century, states the number of the mosques in that city  and its suburbs at six hundred and fifty, of which fifty were very large, and the baths at eighty-five.  Leo Africanus also confirms the statement. The author of the Karttds says, that in the days of Al-  mansir, Sultén of the Almohades, the city of Fez contained seven hundred and eighty-five mosques ;  forty-two tanks or reservoirs supplied with water from the river or from springs; ninety-three bath-  houses for the use of the public; eighty-nine thousand two hundred and thirty-six houses; nineteen  thousand four hundred and forty-one masdri or wooden cabins; four hundred and sixty-seven inns; nine  thousand shops, &c. See the translation by Padre Moura, Lisboa, 1828, p. 48; Marmol, Des. de Africa,  vol. ii. fo. 86,.verso, et seg.; and Leo Africanus, apud Ramusium.   Mr. Shakespear’s copy adds that the number of mindrets or towers, whence the people were summoned  to prayer, was four thousand three hundred, which would give the same number of mosques, since the  two are always joined.         CHAPTER II.    1 'Obeyd Ibnu-l-jerréh and Khéled Ibn Walid were the two Arabian generals who, under the Khalifate  of Omar, son of Al-khattéb, (a.u. 14,) took the city of Damascus, when the principal temple was by  them divided as here stated. See Al-makin, Hist. Sar. apud Erpenium, fo. 28, and Abu-l-fed4, Ar. Mos/.  vol. i. p, 223.    2 The epitome reads ied WEA. il Binjent, which I suppose is meant for St. Vincent,  who suffered martyrdom in Valencia under the Proconsul Dacien, the 22nd of January, a.p. 304, and  who is called by St. Paulinus the “glory and ornament of Spain.” (See the Flos Sanctorum.) But  among the Christian temples mentioned by Florez (Esp. Sag. vol. ix. p. 121) as existing in Cordova before  the invasion, I find none dedicated to St. Vincent. It will, perhaps, not be amiss to observe here that  Ton Habib (loco laudato, fo. 158,) says that the principal Christian church in Cordova, at the time of the  taking of that city by the Moslems, stood in the quarter of the city called Kudyat Abt ’Abdah (see  Note 25, p. 487), not far from the dwelling of Asbagh Ibn Halil.    5) Bad Oey Bln wile —literally ‘they kept suspending or adding roof after roof.’ From  the word sakifah, adding to it sdmt, which in Arabic means ‘high or elevated,’ the Spaniards have  made the word zagui-zamé, asl lw now signifying ‘a garret,’ but the meaning of which was  formerly, as in Arabic, the space between the plastering and the roof, tiling, or covering of a house.    I find this word used by Marmol (.4frica, vol. ii. fo. 176,) to designate the open space underneath a  gateway where the guards of a city generally stand.    ‘ According to Conde (Hist. de la Dom. vol. i. p. 215), the building of the mosque was not begun until  two years afterwards (a.p. 786).

I find it used by Ibn Bashkuwél, fos. 72  and 135, by Ibnu-l-khattib, and by almost every African or Spanish writer, as applied to the aisles or  naves in a mosque, or, rather, to the space between each row of columns, which the Spaniards call  calle, that is, ‘alley,’ ‘walk.’ In describing the mosque of Damascus, Ibn Battuttah (original Travels)    uses the following expressions: in we el Fw Bubiome OB Ghed Jame GIbb 3  Rad oj) gS y Ryle and 9 2)! cel ene Sy FS Ete OU Uae ED US  “and the aisles in the mosque of Damascus are three in number, extending from east to west, each of  “ the aisles being ten paces wide, and resting upon fifty-four columns and eight square pillars.”    oe ee me eet ees 9 coe eee mn erence af",564,,

However, when  treating of the dimensions of a mosque, I have always preferred preserving the original word to prevent  all mistake ; jauf meaning, properly, ‘the body of the mosque,’ or that part of it which was opposite to  the Aiblak, to which ever point of the compass this might be turned.    n we sahan, in Spanish zaguaa, is ‘an open court,’ and sometimes ‘a porch.’    © The actual dimensions of the mosque are as follow: in length, from north to south, six hundred and  twenty feet; in width four hundred and forty. The court measures in length two hundred and twenty.    3 The doors of the cathedral were still covered in the sixteenth century with plates of brass, as here  described. See Amb. Morales, Antig. de Espana, fo. 121.    ‘Tt is almost impossible to fix with any degree of certainty the number of columns of all sizes which  the mosque of Cordova contained during the times of Mohammedan sway. Both Ambrosio de Morales  and the Infante Don Juan Manuel, who described it before their numbers were considerably reduced by  the modern unnecessary, not to say barbarous, alterations to which that building has been exposed, state  it at one thousand and twelve, but it is not unlikely that when the mosque was converted into a church,  some were removed to make room for altars, chapels, and the like. See Conde de Lucanor, by Don Juan  Manuel, and Morales, Antig. de Espana, Alcalé, 1575, fo. 119, et seq.    13 The makssirah is a screen or enclosure surrounding the mikrdb with a sort of throne or platform,    somewhat elevated above the level of the mosque, where the Sultan sits; it is generally railed in.

I ought to observe that both Idrisi and Ibnu-l-abbér treat of this Koran as being in the mosque  of Cordova in their time. The latter author, who declares he saw it, says that it was called ’OthmAnf, not  because it was written by Othman, or had been presented by him to any mosque, but because it contained  four leaves out of a Korén which that Khalif held against his bosom when he was pierced by the daggers  of his assassins. ‘‘ Traces of the precious blood of the Khalif were still visible in my time,” says Ibnu-  l-abbér, The geographer Ibn Iyas (Brit.

(See Ibnu-l-khattib, apud Casiri, vol. ii. p. 301, and Conde, vol. ii. p. 451.) This Prince is not men-  tioned by the author of the Karttds, whose chronology reaches only to the year 726; but I find an  account of him in a short history of Morocco described elsewhere, Note 73, p. 349. Abii-l-hasan  reigned twenty years and four months; after which he was killed in the mountains of Hentetah, in the  jurisdiction of Morocco, towards the end of Rabi’ 1., a. H. seven hundred and fifty-two (a.p. 1351).    35 The famous battle of Tarifa, or Ja batalla del Salado (as it is called by the Spaniards), was fought on  Monday, the ninth of Jum4da 1., a.#. seven hundred and forty-one (Oct. a.p. 1340), by the combined  armies of Castile and Portugal.    % T have omitted a kassidah of unusual length, describing this Korn, the different cases and bags in  which it was wrapped, and the additional ornaments with which it was embellished by the Sultan Abi-  ']-hasan, when it was brought to Fez, the capital of his dominions.

Father Figuerola, in his Tratado contra   el Alcordn (a MS. work in my possession), fo. 40, verso, says ‘ Zomas son unas torres altas y estrechas en   “« que un Moro se subia para llamar los demas d la zala.” The last word, zala, is likewise Arabic, and ,  comes from saldt (prayer).    % An inscription commemorating the building of this tower is still preserved on one of the interior  walls. It bears the date of Dhi-l-hajjah, a.u. 354, that is, four years after the accession of Al-hakem IT.    % T think the author means “in the hand-writing of the Khalif Al-hakem,” who is reported to have  composed a book on the history of Spain, from which Ibnu Hayy4n, Ibnu Bashkiwél, and other eminent  historians, borrowed considerably. This, too, would agree better with the reading of my copy, where it  is said “ in a book in the hand-writing of the Khalif Al-mustanser-billah.”    ® The word I have translated ‘ reservoir for purification’ is 3 + Léa! from lg which means ‘ to make    ablutions.’    4!

The Spanish words canto, caferia, cafada, are all derived from the Arabic §li3 kanndt, which means    ‘areed,’ (in Spanish eafa,) and figuratively, a subterraneous canal through which water is made to flow,  a pipe.    “ Rather ‘cisterns,’ for such is the meaning of Hy Jjawdb, the plural of > Jub or sib, whence  the Spanish algibe.    © These marble receptacles for water may still be seen in the cathedral of Cordova. The quarry  whence they were extracted is likewise shown by the peasants at a few miles from the city.    # I find a description of this establishment in the Biographical Dictionary of Ibnu Bashkiwél, in the  article ‘Ahmed Ibn Khaled,’ a poet who resided in it for a long time. It appears that it was chiefly  destined for poor theologians, or students who came to Cordova from the provinces to study the law.  Eminent literary men, poets, orators, and historians, were also admitted and honourably treated. The  former received a daily allowance of food, and provisions of all sorts, besides a small sum of money ;  the latter received yearly pensions from the treasury, each according to his merits or station in life.    “ Al-beladhori, an ancient geographer who described Spain in the fourth century of the Hijra, and  Ibn Haukal, who copied him, say that the extensive plain of Fahssu-l-bolitt, close to Cordova, was",569,,

For a plan of the mosque of Cordova, as it was in the times of the Arabs, the  reader is referred to the drawings of Murphy, and the splendid work published by the Spanish Academy  of San Fernando in 1780. In neither work, however, are the various additions painted in colours.    5! The word roa a'ldj, which I have translated by ‘ slaves,’ is the plural of e ’alaj, and means,    properly speaking, ‘a barbarian or foreigner,’ and hence ‘a Christian.’ In the latter times. of the  Mohammedan empire in Spain the word ‘adj, which passed afterwards into the Spanish elche, was applied  by the Moslems to all those among their countrymen who held communion with the Christians.    82 This cistern, which occupies almost the whole of the court, is still preserved as in the days of  Al-mansir. It is built in the shape of a vault made with strong arches.    58 The meaning of the word APs Lt, mashdki is entirely unknown to me. It is only by guess that I    have translated ‘ supporters ;’ for if the author means a sort of frame, within which the wick of a Moorish  lamp of this description is encompassed to prevent its sinking into the oil, they are generally made  of lighter materials than lead, such as cork, wood, sometimes a very thin piece of tin, &c. It may  also mean a sort of ring made of lead or wire, within which glasses or lamps of this kind are generally  suspended. .    4 The ps kintar, whence the Spanish quintal, is a measure of weight of one hundred pounds.  Most of the Spanish names for weights and measures are derived from the Arabic: for instance,  arroba, a weight of twenty-five pounds, comes from vw! ar-roba’, which in Arabic means the    fourth part of a kintar; arralde and arrelde are pounds, from db, rattl; zeme, a span, is from xls    shemeh; almud, a measure for grain, is from he mudd, which might itself be a corruption of modius ;  cahiz and cafiz are from pss kafiz; aukia, an ounce, comes from 45, oukiyyak, and this seemingly    from the Greek obyxia; kilate, a weight of four grains, from ae or bI Vs xepdriov, a bean, and the    weight of a bean; danigue, a weight of two kirats, from (4)!y—mizcal, a weight of 1? drachms, from",570,,

I remember having read the same  thing in Ibnu-l-abbér. Marmol Carvajal, (Descrip. de Africa, vol. ii. fo. 86,) while treating of Fez, says  that in the great mosque called Mesjidu-l-kairawin there were some bronze lamps cast out of the materials  of bells brought from Spain. In one of his expeditions against the Christians, Al-mansir removed the  bells of the church of Santiago, and brought them to Cordova. See Conde, Hist. de la Dom. vol. i.  p. 381.   % I have here omitted the translation of a long kass(dah, by the Faquih and Kétib Abii Mohammed  Tbréhim Ibn Séhibi-s-salét Al-welb&ni (of Huelva), giving an account of this mosque.    87 That is to say, during the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahmén III. and that of his successors, Al-hakem II.  and Hishém II., for these are the only three sovereigns of the house of Umeyyah who assumed in Spain  the title of Khalifs.    58 I am inclined to believe that Al-makkarf made here a mistake, since the phenomenon which he  describes is attributed by almost every Arabian geographer I have consulted to a globe of quicksilver  placed in the centre of a circular hall in the palace of Az-zahr&, not in the mosque of Cordova.    59 Nashaku-l-azhdr ft ‘ajdyibi-l-akttdr is the title of a geographical work by Ibn Iyés. (See Preface.)  I have collated this passage with a copy of that work in the Brit. Mus., No. 7503, fo. 9. The author  gives likewise the dimensions of the mosque, and the number of lamps, which he calls 2 yo tanir, (in  Spanish atanor,) but adds no new particulars.    © Some of the ovals here alluded to are still remaining, but the inscriptions were carefully effaced  when the mosque was transformed into a Christian temple.

But, by multiplying the twenty-five  years of An-néssir’s reign by three hundred thousand dinérs, which he is reported to have spent annually,  I only obtain seven millions and a half, which leads me to suppose that Ibnu Khaldiin committed an error  when he said that a beyt-md/ was one million of dingrs.    3% Instead of ‘ eighty mudd and seven kafiz,’ I suspect that the contrary is meant by the author, since  the latter measure is larger than the former.

At present the mudd, or almud as it is called in Spain, is the twelfth part of the bushel;  and the cahiz is no longer used as a measure of capacity, but as one of extension. It is used to designate  a piece of ground capable of receiving twelve fanegas (bushels) of corn in seed.    9 Instead of pup do! ‘Ahmed the Greek,’ my copy and the epitome read 5 pala! « Ahmed    the philosopher.’ Such also appears to have been the reading in Mr. Shakespear’s manuscript.    © It is recorded both by Christian and Mohammedan writers that a Christian bishop was employed by  ’Abdu-r-rahmén in several embassies to the sovereigns of Europe, and, among others, to Otho, Emperor    of Germany.

The first article, to  which I now allude, is imperfect at the end, and was probably bound with the other treatises long after it  had ceased to be complete, for it bears all the traces of great antiquity, being probably written at the  beginning of the fourteenth century, while all the other documents appear from a note at the end of the  volume to have been transcribed at Huesca, in Aragon, in 1603. The author is nowhere mentioned, but  he must have been a Mohammedan in heart, if not externally, for the work begins with the usual  invocations to Allah and his messenger Mohammed. In the course of the narrative the works of Ibnu  Hayy4n and Al-fat‘h Al-kaysi, two celebrated historians, are frequently quoted, and every thing tends to  prove that it is a compilation from Arabian sources. However, viewed in an historical light, the work is  of little or no value; besides being incomplete, it is in most instances fabulous, and generally exaggerated.  It is evidently the work of some wretched Morisco, who, moved at the degraded condition of his fellow  citizens living under the Spanish yoke, undertook to retrace to their minds the scenes of past glory and  magnificence which surrounded the throne of the Khalifs.   Manuscripts of this kind are by no means uncommon; they abound in the Escurial Library, where  Casiri often met with them, and invariably described them as being Arabic. There are upwards of one  hundred in the National Library at Madrid; and it is natural to suppose that hundreds of them upon all  subjects perished in the flames of the autos de fé. They were to be found as late as the seventeenth  century all along the coast of Africa, whither the exiled Moriscos carried them. (See Morgan’s  Mahometism Explained, London, 1725.) The library of the University of Carffbridge, those of Stockholm,  Paris, and many others on the continent, possess a few of these interesting relics. The author of this  note procured some for the late De Sacy, with whom he maintained a correspondence of several years  on the subject. For further information upon this interesting topic the reader is referred to an article  in the Foreign Quarterly Review for January, 1839, where a rapid sketch of the origin, progress, and  probable causes of the Morisco literature has been given.    2 Mr. Shakespear has rendered > by ‘ black pulse,’ and I have followed his translation; the    word, however, is susceptible of various meanings, ‘ lentils,’ ‘ pease,’ or what the Spaniards call garbanzos.    23 A. reads dye gonllomy copy and the epitome Syl] eal I think, however, that cell    ry) is the right reading. pre is nothing more than the Latin word marmor arabicised.    a 4), i] —the plural of aA from \_J5 ‘to turn,’    25 All the copies read Al-mansiur (the victorious), but as there was no king of the family of Dhi-n-nin  who assumed that title, I think that A/-mdmin is to be substituted.

"    CHAP. Iv.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 505.    ? The author here introduces a description of Cordova, which he professes to have read in an  anonymous work in the East, but as it contains much which has already been translated, I have thought  proper to suppress it in the body of the work, and insert it here.   “« Cordova is the capital of Andalus, and the residence of its Khalifs; it is a great and populous city,  “inhabited by Arabs of the noblest and principal families in the land, who are distinguished by  “ the elegance of their manners, the superiority of their mind and wit, and the opulence and exquisite  “taste which they display in their meals, drink, dress, and horses. There thou wilt find doctors  “shining with all sorts of learning, poets endowed with every talent, lords distinguished by their  “virtues and generosity, warriors renowned for their expeditions into the countries of the infidels,  “‘ and officers experienced in all sorts of warfare. The city of Cordova is divided into five cities or  “‘ quarters immediately contiguous to each other, but separated by a high and strongly-fortified  “wall. Each of these five cities has within its precincts every thing that is requisite either for  “the comfort or the luxuries of its inhabitants, such as baths, markets, inns, shops, and trades of  “every description. Cordova is three miles in length and one in width ;¢ it is built at the foot of  “‘a mountain which commands it: in the third city, which now occupies the centre of the town,  “there is a bridge and a mosque, neither of which buildings have their equal in the world. The ,—  “latter measures one hundred cubits in length, and eighty in breadth. It contains one thousand  “large columns and one hundred and thirteen brass chandeliers, the largest of which is capable of  “ holding at least one thousand lights. There is besides in this mosque so much carving and inlaid  “‘ work, and this so admirably executed, as to baffle all attempts at description. In the kiblak, especially,  “ there are works of art which dazzle the eyes of the spectator. In that part of the mosque occupied by  “the mihrdb there are seven arches resting upon columns of the most beautiful marble, and rising to  “such a height that both Christians and Moslems are continually expressing their admiration at their  “ beautiful proportions. The jambs forming the arch at the entrance of the mihrdb are made of  “ four columns of inestimable value, two of green marble, the other two of lapis-lazuli. There is also  ‘a pulpit, which has not its equal in all the inhabited world ; it is constructed with precious and aromatic  “ woods, such as the Indian plantain, ebony, bakam, and aloes wood. It is said in the history of the Beni  “Umeyyah that this pulpit was built and carved in the space of seven years by the hands of eight  “ workmen continually employed on it, each of whom received a mithkdl Mohammed{ as his daily wages,  “and that the total amount of expense incurred for it was one thousand and fifty mithkdls. The tower is  “ likewise considered one of the wonders of the world. It is very lofty, and wide in proportion, being  “ entirely built of freestone, which gives it extraordinary solidity. On the top of it are three balls, which  “« the people of Cordova call pomegranates, and which are supported on a spike of gilt brass rising high in  “the air. Two of these pomegranates are made of pure gold; the middle one is of silver. Above these  “ rises a six-petalled lily, also made of gold, and on the top of all a smaller pomegranate, also made of  “the purest gold. The walls of the tower, both in the interior and externally, are ornamented with such »—~  “ fanciful drawings and ingenious work that it is quite out of our power to describe it. There is also in  “ this mosque a large store-room full of silver and gold lamps to place on the above-mentioned chandeliers  “ for the purpose of lighting the mosque, as well as a most beautiful copy of the blessed Koran, written, as  ‘it is supposed, in the hand of the Khalif Othman. The entrance to the mosque is by twenty doors covered  “with Andalusian brass, highly polished, and kept in such a state of brilliancy and preservation that  “whoever looks at them at noon may fancy them so many suns. But what surpasses all this are  “the three columns of red marble in the body of the mosque, since any one may see plainly inscribed on         © No doubt exclusive of the suburbs.  VOL. 1. 3T",575,,

As to the palace of   “ Az-zahré, which ’Abdu-r-rahmén An-nfssir caused to be built near Cordova, on a plain which is only   “ separated from that city by the river, we need not mention it here, since it is well known that its   “* erection is the best testimony that can be adduced of the power and splendour of the dynasty of the   “‘ Beni Umeyyah in Andalus.

It is  frequently used to designate a sovereign ruling independent in a country, but who has not assumed the  title of Khalif. It is also given to the king of a nation of infidels, as Sdhib Konstantiniyyah (the Emperor  of Constantinople) ; S¢hib Toleytolah (the King of Toledo). Sometimes, too, it implies a governor, and  such is no doubt the meaning intended in this passage; but as Roderic is lower down called also Sdhib,    and the Arabian writers are at variance respecting Ilyén, I have preferred the more vague appellation of  ‘ Lord.’    ‘ os!

It is well known that the Arabs write generally without vowels; the  want, however, is easily supplied by the help of grammar and the dictionaries; not so with proper  names, the reading of which, unless they are pointed, becomes a mere matter of guess. Hence it is that  Ton Khallekén, As-safadi, Abd-l-mahésen, and their best biographers, give always the spelling of  geographical and proper names. The word |, not pointed, may be read Yalyda or Ilydn, but by  no means Julian, as the generality of the Spanish historians have written it; for had such been the  reading intended by the Arabs, they would have written PA 2, 88 in the words ing?

Besides, both Al-bekri (/oco laudato, fo. 77, verso,) and Sheh&bu-d-din Al-fési (Ar.

The Cronica General, attributed to Alfonso el sabio, but which, undoubtedly, was the  work of converted Arabs and Jews, has likewise Ilan; and lastly, San Pedro Pascual, who wrote in the  dungeons of Granada at the beginning of the fourteenth century, and who must have heard the Mo-  hammedans pronounce his name, calls him Don Yilan.    5 Roderic is again called Ludherik, the change of / into r, and vice versd, being frequent among the  Arabs. In what follows I shall always call him ‘‘ Roderic,” in whatever way his name may be written.    6 The appointment of Miisa to the government of Africa has been placed ten years later by some  Arabian writers; but there can be no doubt that those who did so confounded his confirmation by  Al-walid, in a.a. 88, with his appointment by ’Abdu-l-malek, which happened ten years before. See  App. E., p. lv.    7 As will be seen hereafter (App. E., p. lv.), Musa’s appointment originated in the command given him  by ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Merw4n, Viceroy of Egypt, and brother to the reigning Khalif, ’Abdu-l-malek.  This took place towards the end of the year 78, Muisa not entering Western Africa until early the next  year, a circumstance which accounts for the discrepancy here observed between the accounts of Al-  homaydi and Ibnu Hayyén.   Directly after this passage there follows in the MS. another, conceived in nearly the same words, bat  placing Musa’s nomination in 89, and making it proceed from ’Abdullah, governor of Egypt. I need  scarcely point out the circumstance which gave rise to so erroneous a statement. After the death of  *Abdu-l-’aziz (a.H. 86), ’Abdu-l-malek appointed ’Abdullah, another of his brothers, to succeed him, and  it is probable that Musa, whose government of Africa was a dependency of Egypt, had to take the  customary oath of allegiance to the new Viceroy.    & The Arabian geographers divide the regions watered by the river Sis into al-addaf, or ‘the nearest,’  and al-aksd, or ‘the remote.’ The former was naturally that part which fell nearest to their possessions  in Eastern Africa; the latter, that extensive country beyond the Sis, and bordering on Siidén. See   “Marmol, Descrip. de Africa, vol. ii. fo. 15, verso; Idrisi, clim. ii. sect.11; Grammaye, Africa Illustrata,  p. 18.    9 If the Khalif’s share amounted to sixty thousand, the number of captives taken in these expeditions  must have been three hundred thousand, since the fifth of all the spoil gained in war belonged by right to  the sovereign.    10 Owing to the system of warfare adopted by the Arabs, it is not improbable that the number of  captives here specified fell into Musa’s hands. It appears both from Christian and Arabian authorities  that populous towns were not unfrequently razed to the ground, and their inhabitants, amounting to  several thousands, led into captivity.",580,,

A similarity of habits, the same love of war and plunder,  the same roving propensities, and the existence of various traditions current amongst them, purporting  them to be sprung from the same stock as the invaders,—a belief which the wary old general tried  dexterously to strengthen,—rendered easy that which, under any other circumstances, it would have been  next to impossible to accomplish. The Berbers, too, were sunk in the grossest ignorance; a few only  professed Christianity. A considerable portion still worshipped idols, but the greatest number professed  Judaism, a circumstance which the reader must bear in mind, as it will be found to have powerfully  contributed to the invasion and conquest of Spain by the Mohammedans.    16 By the word Rum, which I have translated by ‘ Greeks,’ the author means the Imperialists, in whose  hands were still some of the fortresses and ports lining the northern shores of Africa. The word was  first used to designate the Romans of the lower empire and the people living in its dependencies. It  became in time a synonyme for Christian, owing to the Greeks generally professing Christianity. How-  ever, Ibnu Khaldin, in his history of the Berbers (Brit. Mus., No, 9575, fo. 48), condemns the use of  the word in the latter acceptation. He says, ‘‘ I do not recollect ever meeting with the word Rum as  “‘ applied to any nation or race of people inhabiting this country (Africa), at the time of its occupation  “by the Arabs, nor have I ever met with that word in the ancient works which relate the said events,  “ whence I conclude that they were called so by antonomasia; since the Arabs of those days, not being  “acquainted with the Franks (Vandals) as a nation, and having no other people to deal with and make  “war upon in Syria but the Rim, to whose empire they imagined all the other Christian nations to be  “ tributary, thought that Heraclius, the Roman Emperor, was the King of all Christendom.

That they kept possession of both Ceuta and Tangiers,  which they considered as the keys of the Strait, and ruled at one time over the mountain districts of  Gomera, may be inferred from Isidorus Pacensis, and the Monk of Silos; but, as I shall show hereafter,  it is more than probable that, at the time of the Saracen invasion, the authority of the Gothic monarchs  was slightly, if at all, acknowledged in Africa.

If Ilyén concluded a treaty with Musa (as afterwards stated), there  was no occasion for the surrender of that city. .    2 The name of this monarch is written in some copies Xtsbe—in others x4. —in a fragment of    eee    Ibnu-l-kittiyyah in my possession Kthit There can be no doubt, however, of its being meant for  Wittiza, although there is no historical evidence of his ever having sent troops to Africa.

It is probable that the author meant  eo Ejih or Egica, who, according to the testimony of both ‘Arabian and Christian writers, dispatched  Theodomir (the Arabs call him Adfunsh) with a fleet to ravage the Mohammedan settlements along  the coast of Northern Africa. Adh-dhobi (Arab. MS. in the Nat. Lib. Mad., Gg. 14,) puts this event    in a.

In the meanwhile Roderic, who had been general of the forces under  “the King their father, revolted with such of the troops as would follow his party, and marched upon  “Cordova, where he fixed his residence.”   Roderic’s accession to the throne is, like most events of that important period, enveloped in darkness ;  and amongst the contradictory accounts of the Spanish historians it is next to impossible to decide at  what time and by what means Roderic accomplished his usurpation. Rodericus tumultuost regnum hortante  senatu invadit, says Isidorus (Esp. Sag. vol. viii. No. 34); but whether he did so after the death of  Wittiza, as Sebastianus (Esp. Sag. vol. xiii. p. 478) states, and is here surmised by Ibnu Hayy4n and  Ibnu-]-kiittiyyah, or whether he succeeded in wresting the power from the hands of that monarch,  and reigning conjointly with him, as Rodericus Toletanus (lib. iii. cap. xvii.) asserts, is not clearly  ascertained. The latter opinion, however, appears the most probable, as by means of it we are enabled to  reconcile the account of Sebastian, who gives Roderic a reign of three years, with that of Isidorus,  who makes him reign only one.    % See Ambrosio Morales (Cron.

In general, the African historians  designate the coast of their country under the name of ‘udwatu-l-janubiyyah (southern shore), to dis-  tinguish it from those of Spain, which they call ’udtatu-sh-shamaliyyak (northern shore).    % The mountains of Gomera are a branch of the Atlas, so denominated after an African tribe called  the Beni Ghomérah, who afterwards played so distinguished a part in the last wars of Granada.

Those of an older date, if they  mention Ilyén at all, say nothing about his misunderstanding with Roderic. ee    ® This fable, which has found its way into most of the sober histories of Spain, was first introduced   by the Monk of Silos, a chronicler of the eleventh century. There can be no doubt that he borrowed it   from the Arabs, but it seems hard to believe that it was altogether a tale of their invention. There are   facts in it which an Arab could not have invented unless he drew them from Christian sources; and, as I   shall show hereafter, the Arabs knew and consulted the writings of the Christians.

The work is but a short one, and the facts  therein stated are very meagre; but, besides the author being himself a writer of the tenth century,  he was (see Note 96, p. 460,) a descendant of Wittiza in the female line.

This merchant used to bring to Roderic horses, hawks, and other productions of those  “ countries. It happened, however, that the wife of the merchant came to die, leaving him one daughter,  “ of great beauty; and Roderic having commanded him to repair to Africa, he excused himself with his  « wife’s death, and his having no one to entrust with the care of his daughter while he was absent ;  “‘ upon which the King ordered that she should be lodged in his own palace. But Roderic’s eye having  “rested on her, he was taken in love with her charms, and he obtained the gratification of his wishes.  “Upon the return of Ily4n to court, the girl apprised him of what had taken place; and My4n said to  *« Roderic, ‘I have in store for thee horses and hawks, such as thou never sawest before in thy life.’  “He then asked his permission to take away his daughter with him; and his request being granted,  “ Roderic suffered her to depart, after loading her with presents and money.

It is an error to  suppose, as some modern critics have done, that the ridiculous fables which disfigure this part of the  Spanish annals are the conception of the heated imaginations of the pious chroniclers of the middle  ages; nor can they either be wholly attributed to the more fantastic minds of the Arabs. It was in the  midst of populous cities like Toledo, Cordova, and Seville, and among the motley elements which  formed their population,—Jews, Muzarabs, and Moors,—speaking a sort of jargon called aljamia, that  these and other fables of the same stamp were forged and adopted by the Arabs, who, as usual, im-  parted to them an eastern colouring.

Rojas, Pisa, Roman de la Higuera, Lozano, and the rest of the historians of Toledo, have dwelt at  full length and considerably improved upon this amusing legend, which is better known to the English  reader through the poetical pens of Scott, Southey, and Washington Irving.         CHAPTER II.    1 The author of the Reyhdnu-l-albdb (Ar. MS. in my possession) says that Ilyén did not go himself to  see Miisa, but wrote him a letter, which he gives in the following terms. ‘ Hasten to that country where  “the palaces are built of gold and silver, and those who dwell in them are like women, owing to the  “ exuberance of their comforts and the abundance of their riches.” Such were at that time, observes the  author, the luxury and magnificence in which the Goths lived, that the candlesticks upon which they  lighted their tapers were made of silver and gold; their land abounding with mines which yielded every  where those precious metals, and the soil being capable of producing any fruit whatsoever. -   As I shall often have occasion in the course of these notes to refer to the above work, which I have  already slightly described in the Preface, I will give here a fuller account of its contents. The author  divides it into seven ladders, each of which is further subdivided into various steps. The first treats of  science in general. 2. Of the sciences and arts cultivated by the Arabs, and some of their usual names.  3. Of similes, expressions conveying a double meaning, ironical sentences, &c. 4. Of eloquence and  elegance of style. 5. Of poetry and the rules of prosody. 6. Of genealogy. 7. Of history and the  biography of poets. In this last division, the largest in the work, the author introduces a history of  the Khalifs of the houses of Umeyyah and ‘Abbas, beginning with Abi Bekr As-sadik, and ending  with Al-muktafi li-amri-llah ’Abdullah, Khalif of the latter family;. to which is appended, by way  of supplement, a concise but valuable account of the conquest of Spain by the Arabs, followed by a  chronological history of the Sultans of Cordova, and other Kings who reigned in various parts of  Mohammedan Spain, under the following title: ‘‘ Step treating of the rulers of Andalus from    “the conquest until the present time, being the year 557.” wit Peay FL) o kxdlliie BSye    oor Ka gp y 152 Why I Yad ye Ge    ,    2 The text is too explicit to leave any doubt whatever.    3 This firet expedition, commanded by [lyn in person, is not mentioned either by the continuator of the  Chronicon Biclarense or by Isidorus Pacensis, two contemporary writers. Many even of the Arabian  historians omit it altogether; but this is not to be wondered at if we consider their mode of writing, at  times laconic to excess, at others fastidiously diffuse. It is natural enough that if such a proposition was  made to a wary old warrior like Miisa, as that of invading a powerful and compact empire, the richee and  resources of which had no doubt long been exaggerated bv captives, he must, in the first instance, have  suspected the man who, turning his arms against his own country, made him such an offer; and that in  order to put his fidelity to the test, he should enjoin him first to invade alone the land whither he wished  him to carry his arms.    4 The ninetieth year of the Hijra, or Mohammedan flight, began to be counted November 19,",586,,

Ily4n’s expedition must therefore have taken place in November or December, a.p. 709,  shortly after Roderic’s usurpation.    5 These words ‘‘to try conquest” show that the first incursion was undertaken merely to put Ilyan’s  fidelity to the test.    $ The word which I have translated by ‘light troops’ is Ul ww sardyd, the plural of & ». sariyah, which  means a body of light cavalry of between three and five hundred men.    7 Tarif Abii Zar’ah, or Abi Zor’ah, (since the word acy; admits of either pronunciation,) has often  been confounded with Térik Ibn Zey4d by the Christian historians, notwithstanding their being two  distinct individuals, and their having invaded Spain at different times. The similarity of their names led,  no doubt, to the mistake. Conde, who mentions both expeditions, that of the year 91, and that of the —  ensuing year, attributes the two to Tarik, and I need scarcely observe that this glaring mistake has since  crept into the works of Dunham, Aschbach, and others of his translators or compilers. Had they  consulted the Latin chronicles, they would have found the statement confirmed by almost every national  writer of note; for, although his name is corrupted, there can be no doubt that he is meant by all:  Abi Zara in Isidorus (sect. 34); Abzuhura in Monachus Albendensis; Rodericus Toletanus says Tarif,  nomine, cognomine Aben Zarcha, a misprint for Abi Zarcha or Abi Zar’ah. Mr. Shakespear has read  Tarif’s surname differently. He calls him Abi Dhua, (de 50 >! ?) but it is obviously either a fault of the    copy or a mis-reading of the translator.    ® This is the exact number recorded by Conde (vol. i. p. 28) as having landed in Spain under the  orders of Tdrik,—a further proof that the work which that writer consulted read in this instance Tarif.  But the Spanish translator was a poor critic. He made his blunder still more conspicuous by a note  at the bottom of the page, stating that ‘‘as the copy of Adh-dhobi which he used (Bib.

Jezirah Al-khadhrd (the verdant island) is the modern  Algesiras. A emall island at the mouth of its port is still called by the Spaniards Isla verde. The  authors of the notes appended to the splendid edition of Mariana, (Valencia, 1770, vol. ii. p. 385,)  being unable to reconcile how Tarik, who is reported in one place to have landed at Gibraltar,  could possibly have also landed at a spot called Jeztrah Al-khadhrd, imagined that the rock Calpe  was by the invaders called ‘the green island.’ It is evident that the author of the note never visited  Gibraltar, or else he would not have fancied that the sterile rock could ever have been called  ‘verdant’ by the Arabs.    Tt is clear from the expression ‘where the Arabs of our days keep their ships and their naval  stores,’ that Al-makkari transcribes here the words of an historian of the seventh century of the  Hijra, when the reigning dynasty of the Almohades considerably strengthened the port of Algesiras,",587,,

Ramadhén being the last month of the  Mohammedan year, Tarif’s invasion must have taken place between the 29th September and the 27th  October, 710, which date must be substituted for the August or September, a.v. 710, as in my trans-  lation.    5 Tf reasonable doubts may be raised about Ilyan’s expedition to Spain, that of Tarif ie too cir-  cumstantially detailed to admit of any. Not only is it recorded by almost every Mohammedan writer  who has related in detail the events attendant on the conquest, but it may be found even in the  Christian historians, from Isidorus Pacensis down to Rodericus Toletanus; since those who make no  mention of Tarif admit of two expeditions at the orders of Térik, the similarity of the names giving  rise to the mistake. .

Most of the Arabian writers simply call him ‘the Berber,’    and such he must have been if he really was a mauli or liberated slave of Musa, in which case the  patronymic ‘ Al-mughéferi,’ being that of an illustrious Arabian tribe, is in nowise suited to him.—  On the other hand, if he was an African by birth, how could his name be Tarff, (an Arabic word  meaning ‘an elegant and comely youth,’ ‘a man who is descended from a long series of ancestors,’)  and that of his father Malik? This difficulty, however, can easily be obviated by supposing that  both he and his father received new names on their embracing the Mohammedan religion, as was    customary in such cases.    19 T read in the Reyhdnu-l-albdb that Ily4n met Musa at Cairwén, and spoke to him at length on the  best means of invading Spain and making the conquest of the land.    ® The same variance which I have said existed with regard to Tarif’s name and patronymic, as written  by the historians of Mohammedan Spain, is to be found in that of Tarik. Idrisi (clim. iv. sect. 1) calls  him Térik Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn oS) Wanmu, or Unmu; Ibnu Bashkuw4l, Térik Ibn ’Amrnu, of the tribe of    Zenétah ; Ibnu Khaldin gives him the patronymic (¢ jill An-nefezi; others call him Al-lakhmi,  no doubt because he was a mauli of Miisa, who himself belonged to the tribe of Lakhm.    ee  21 | have preserved in this, as well as in many other instances, the word yo mauli, because its    meanings are so many and different that it is impossible to find an equivalent to it in English. A mauli  signifies a man who attaches himself to another for the sake of protection, and who places himself under  a species of bondage to him ; it means also a liberated slave, who in the act of obtaining his manumission  becomes comprised in that category. In the first wars of Islam it was customary for the Arabian  generals to grant freedom to all those captives who embraced the Mohammedan religion; and in this  manner Musa is said to have had several thousand maulis. See Appendix E., page Ixxxiii.    2 If the ninety-second year of the Hijra began to be counted on the 28th October, a.p. 710, the  month of Sha’ban, which is the eighth of the Mohammedan or lunar year, commenced on the 23rd May,  711, and ended on the 20th June. Térik’s disembarkation, according to the writer here quoted, must  therefore have taken place on the 23rd or 30th of May, or the 6th, 13th, or 20th of June, which  happened to be Saturdays, and not in August, as here stated; but the writer knew that August was the  eighth month of the Christian year, as Sha’bén was the eighth of the Mohammedan.    o 6 oe  BI pe pn Fe oe ell Se Fai dele ol gis pail  Such is the reading in all the copies; but, on fuller consideration, I do not think myself justified in trans-  lating as I have done.

See Paulus Diaconus,  De rebus gestis Longobardorum, lib. vi. cap. 46, p. 503. The historians consulted by Conde (vol. i.  p. 28) say that Térik sailed from Tangiers to Ceuta, and thence to Spain, which accounts for the  discrepancy.   Another account, which I have omitted in the translation, says that the vessels thus employed were  only four, which would imply no increase of navy since the preceding year. But is it probable that the  Arabs, masters of the Mediterranean from Tripoli to the Straits, and who had already made repeated  incursions on the shores of Spain, could not muster more than four vessels to convey an army of  twelve, or at least seven thousand men? What had become of the two hundred and seventy sail with  which, according to Rodericus Toletanus (De Reb. Hisp. lib. iii.), they had only a few years before  ravaged the coast of Spain? There is another circumstance in this account which to me is inexplicable.  Why are Ily&n’s vessels said to have been ‘ merchant vessels?’ The Archbishop says (lib. iii. cap. xix.)  quos separatim durit in Hispaniam in navibus mercatorum ne causa transitus perciperetur ; but although  Ily4n, or even Tarff, with their small force, may have wished to land stealthily, it is not credible that  Tarik, at the head of a numerous army, should have contemplated such an idea.    a    eal we Ps! HS, 9 This may be understood in two different ways; namely, that    Tarik was the last man to embark, or that he was the last man to come on shore and mount his horse.

Tarif, leading the van of the army, might have preceded him: such indeed appears  to have been the case, for it is not to be supposed that the forces that preceded Tarik landed without a  general at their head.    %2 See a previous note, p. 519. asl el The author of the Reyhdnu-l-albdb says that Térik,  after coming down from the rock, ‘ marched to ‘Wada-l-’asel (Rio de la Miel), whence he moved and    “« pitched his tents close to Algesiras.” spall iy kyo) wy n> ra nl sly us & ue ro) ra    33 It would appear from the accounts both of the Christian and Mohammedan writers, that from the  time of Térik’s landing on the coast of Spain to the battle of Guadalete there was a succession of  skirmishes. See Appendix D., p. xlvii.    % | have purposely deferred until now the investigation of the precise period of T4rik’s landing, that I  might more easily pass in review the various dates assigned by the Mohammedan writers. About the  year of the Hijra no doubt can be raised, every historian of the conquest agreeing in fixing it in the year 92;  for although there are not wanting some who place that memorable event either in 91 (Idris{, clim. iv.  sect. 1) or in 93 (Appendix D., p. xlvi.), it is evident that the former allude to Tarif’s invasion, and the  latter to the arrival of Misa, by whom and in whose time Spain was finally conquered. As to the Christian  writers themselves, Masdeu has satisfactorily proved by a series of ingenious arguments that all those of  some note have referred or meant to refer it to the era 749, which corresponds to the 92nd Mohammedan  year. But if this first part of my inquiry be easily settled, it is not so with the month and the day in  which T4rik set his foot on the Spanish shore, since on these points there exists some discrepancy  between the best writers of Mohammedan Spain.   It has been said that Ibnu Hayyén refers the landing of Tarik to a Saturday of the month of Sha’ban,  that is to say, to May 23, 30, or June 6, 13, or 20; other writers place it in Ramadhan, while the generality  of historians have fixed that signal event to the month of Rejeb. But if we examine these accounts with  attention we shall find that the difference is neither so great nor so irreconcilable as it would at first  sight appear. Between the 5th of Rejeb, the earliest date assigned, and the beginning of the month of  Ramadhan, only one month and twenty-five days elapsed. It has been said elsewhere that Tarik had  only four vessels to transport his army to Andalus,—that he was the last man to go on board,—and all  writers, Mohammedan as well as Christian, agree in saying that a long series of skirmishes, protracted  for several days, preceded the fatal engagement by which the Gothic empire was overthrown. It is  therefore evident that those authors who placed that event after the month of Rejeb alluded to some  incursion made by Té4rik as soon as his men had all been put on shore, or to his starting from the rock  where he first landed. The month of Rejeb being once fixed upon, it will not be difficult to ascertain  the precise day. Ibnu-]-khattib says on the 25th, an anonymous writer on the 24th, Adh-dhobi on the  8th, Conde and Casiri, or their authorities, on the 5th. But, first of all, Ibnu-l-khattib never said (as  stated p. 268) that Tarik landed on the 25th Rejeb, for, in the two historical works which we have by him,  he gives different dates. In his chronology of the Khalifs (apud Casiri, vol. ii. p. 182,) he clearly asserts  that Tarik set his foot on the rock of Calpe on a Thursday, the 5th of Rejeb, a.a. 92.

[Book Iv.    “ of Rejeb of the year 92; others say in Sha’ban, others in Ramadh&n (beginning July 21), answering to  “ the month of August of the Christians.” It is evident from what precedes, that instead of wl ue  “five nights being elapsed,” the copy of Ibnu-l-khattfb consulted by Al-makkari read ope Une!  “ five nights remaining,’""—a mistake of frequent occurrence in Mohammedan books. The same observation  is applicable to the date of the 24th Rejeb, since the Mohammedans counting by nights, not by days, the  author who read “‘ five nights remaining” (Rejeb having thirty days) might think that the event was  fixed to the 24th. It now remains for us to ascertain which of the two dates, the 5th or the 8th, is the  right one. We have in favour of the first, Abi-l-fed4, Ibn Khallek4n, Ibnu-l-khattib himself, besides  the writers translated or consulted by Rodericus Toletanus and Conde. The second is defended only by  Tbnu-l-abbér and Adh-dhobi, but in my opinion it is the right one, and my reasons for thus be-  lieving are these. It is clear that Ibnu-l-khattib was guilty of a contradiction, since the 5th of Rejeb  could not be a Monday and a Thursday at once. By looking at the chronological tables of the Mo-  hammedan or lunar year drawn up by the indefatigable Masdeu, I find that the fifth of Rejeb was a  Monday, and therefore the Thursday immediately following it was the 8th. I may therefore advance,  without fear of contradiction, that the landing of Térik on the rock of Gibraltar took place on Thursday,  the 8th of Rejeb, a.u. 92, answering to the 30th of April, a.p. 711.    % The same obscurity is observed respecting this as the other actors in this interesting drama.  Most of the ancient chroniclers call this general Sancho, others Enecus (Eneco or Inigo), both names  which are not Gothic but Basque. Isidorus calls him Theodomir, and adds that he was the same general  who, on a previous occasion, (during the reign of Egica,) had inflicted defeat on the Mohammedans,  while the Arabs say that the general who came to the assistance of the besieged at Ceuta was named  Alfonso. How are these accounts to be reconciled ?    36 See Appendix D., p. xlvi., where the landing of Tarik is given more in detail.    37 All the historians of Spain, Mohammedan as well as Christian, agree in placing Roderic away from  his capital, engaged in war, when the news of Térik’s invasion reached him; none, however, has specified  the cause or occasion of it. It is probable that he was employed in quelling some rebellion excited by the  partisans of the sons of Wittiza.    38 See p. 208, and Note 25, p. 487.

It is evident, however, that those  authors are more correct who reduce them to seven thousand in the first instance, since, owing to the  scanty number of their vessels, they could not all be conveyed at once to the Spanish shore; and since, as  the author rightly observes, Tarik received reinforcements from Africa between the time of his landing  and the battle that ensued, an interval of nearly three months.    6 al | ail %3! sl—literally ‘ the people or the ministers of the Christian eect.’  “4 Riyal wy!

Sag. vol. ix. p. 53,) that Guadalete is a compound of two words, meaning ‘ river of joy,’  and that the Chrysos was so named from the great satisfaction which the Arabs experienced on its banks  when they had defeated Roderic, it is not to be admitted, unless the name of the river be found written    thus, Bit osely Wédda-ledhdhak, and the cause of its being so called be satisfactorily stated.    % Most of the Arabian historians compute Roderic’s army at ninety thousand; a few at seventy  thousand; Ibnu Khaldiin is the only writer whose estimation is so low as forty thousand.    51 «* He himself came in a litter.” The word aye Serir means a ‘throne,’ a ‘couch to recline on,’ a  ‘chariot,’ a ‘litter.’ It was probably the latter.

It is therefore quite demonstrated, that by the province of  Shidtiniah the Arabian geographers meant all that country extending between the mouth of the Guadal-  quivir and the Straits of Gibraltar ; that Medinah-Shidiniah (or the capital of the district of Assido) is the  present town of Medina-Sidonia; lastly, that Xerez was likewise called Sidonia, either from one of the  causes above specified, or from some other not yet ascertained.    64 This account is to be found in Rodericus Toletanus, the Cronica General, and the work of San Pedro  Pascual.    % Tarik, like Cortés, is reported to have set fire to his fleet in order to take away from his followers all  possibility of escape, and induce them to fight strenuously. I read in the Reyhcénu-l-albib, “ Tarik said to  «his men, ‘ You are placed between two enemies, the spears of the infidels and the sea. Let then those  ‘‘ among you who expect the favours of the Almighty behave well on this occasion.’ He then gave orders  * to set fire to all the vessels in which they had crossed.” The fact, however, though asserted by Idrisi  (clim. iv. sect. 1), and by the author of the fragment translated in the Appendix D. (p. xlvii.), may  Teasonably be questioned.    & This is a strong proof in favour of my conjecture (see above, Note 63, p. 525,) that the battle was  fought nearer Medina-Sidonia than Xerez. M. Marlés, the author of a species of rifaccimento of Conde’s  Hist. de la Dom., asserts, on what authority it is not stated, that the battle took place ‘‘ @ deux lieues de  “ Cadiz et prés de la place od s’éléve aujourd'hui Xerez de la frontera.” But the statements of this  writer, whose numerous blunders I shall often have occasion to expose, are very seldom to be relied upon.  In one page only of his book (vol. i. p. 68) I find the following glaring mistakes. He says that Ber  Chalediin (Ibnu Khaldin) wrote a life of Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, confounding, no doubt, the African historian  with the Arabian biographer Ibn Khallekén; and that Bab-Alzakdk (Bdbu-z-zakkdk) means ‘la porte du  chemin’ instead of ‘the mouth of the Strait of Gibraltar.’ He says that the port of Algesiras was so  called by the Arabs because there were once two islands opposite to it. He invariably writes Grarda  instead of Guada (W4da), and seriously informs us that Guard-alete, Guard-iana, &c. are Arabic words.  I should never end were I to point out the innumerable errors into which this writer has fallen whilst  pretending to correct the work of Conde. ,    67 ctl ybias!! ! y7—‘‘and the two armies met near the lake or gulph,”—for the word  buheyruh, whence the Spanish albuhera, partakes of either meaning. In this instance, however, the  lake of la Janda, near Mcdina-Sidonia, is intended. The writer here quoted is not the only one who  asserts positively that the engagement took place on the banks of the lake near Medina-Sidonia. I may,  besides, adduce the testimony of many others, as the author of the Reyhdnu-l-albib, (Arab. MS. in my    possession,) who says that the armies met on the bank of the river Barbét, bby usoly—not far from",596,,
"    CHAP. 11.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 527    the lake. Now the river called W&da Barbét by the Arabs, because it reached the sea near a town of    that name, was also called & wl, ‘Wada Bekkeh, because it passed through or close to another town    called ‘Bekkeh’, now Bejer. (Compare Abd-l-fedé’s Geography ; Idrisi, clim. iv. sect. 1; and Hist. del  Moro Rasis.) 1 confess that when I first learnt that Wiida Bekkeh was the same river as the Wiida  Barbdt, and that some authors, like Ibnu-l-kiittiyyah, had placed the site of the battle on its banks, thé  idea struck me that the present name of the river Guadalete, for which I cannot in any other manner  account, might have originated in a series of corruptions.   Every one acquainted with the peculiar character used by the Arabs of Africa and Spain in their    ser    writings, knows how easy it is to write XL) instead of %J—the letters } and CO being almost alike    in their alphabet. On the other hand, the letter » may, by a mere stroke, be transformed into | Wida  Bekkah, or Wdda Bekkeh, might thus, by a series of corruptions, have been changed first into ‘ Wada  Lekke,’ and thence into ‘ Guadalete.’ Those among my readers who are unacquainted with the Arabic  language, may possibly think my conjecture rather hazardous; but I appeal to the judgment of those who  are conversant with the writings of the Arabian historians and geographers, in which numerous  instances occur of words once ill written having retained their corrupted form, not only in writing,  but even in conversation, For instance, the town of Tenzert, a word meaning ‘encampment’ in the  language of the Berbers, is at times written Benzert or Benizert in Idrisi; in Abii-l-feda, Nebzert ; in    ro  Leo and Marmol, Biserta. Instead of Urb = Bahr Bontus, or the Pontus Euxinus, there is not one    single Arabian geographer, Idrisi himself not excepted, who does not write U-bs = Bahr Nitus,  by the transposition of the points in the firat two letters. I might multiply examples of this kind, but I  shall merely mention another flagrant instance of a proper name thus corrupted becoming, as it were,  riveted upon its bearer. The celebrated traveller, Ibn Battuttah, in treating of the Greek emperor who  was reigning in Constantinople at the time he visited that city, calls him Tekfir, and gives the spelling    soe    of his name thus, yh Such is the reading in all the copies of the epitome consulted by Professor  Lee, as well as in those of Paris; to which I may add, that a transcript of the original Travels in my  possession, made by a learned copyist from a very ancient copy preserved in the great mosque at Fez,  affords the same reading. But who does not see at once that the word pps Tekfiir having in the  first instance been written for pps Nekfiir (Nicephorus Gregoras), gave rise to that singular blunder ?  It may be objected, that similar corruptions are not likely to take place so easily with regard to the  names of towns and places; yet I believe that the words <I.) 4) aubelt dledb and many more in  Spanish geography, all originated in similar corrupt readings, being meant for dle, 9! obs kb  Toletana (urbs), Salambenia, Orcela, or Orcelis, the Roman names for those towns.   Even supposing the Wada Bekkah and the Wida Lekke to have been two distinct rivers, the former  being meant for the river of Bejer, and the latter for the Guadalete, this in no manner opposes my  conjecture that the memorable encounter took place near the sea, and close to Medina-Sidonia, since  the battle having lasted eight days, as is unanimously agreed by Christian and Mohammedan writers,    might have commenced between Bejer and Medina-Sidonia, and ended near the Guadalete, the inter-  mediate distance being only about twenty English miles.    ® The author of the Reyhdnu-l-albdb says, ‘The two children whom Roderic had deprived of the  “empire were also in his camp; they agreed to give way with the right and left wing, that Roderic",597,,
"    528 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book Iv.    * might be left alone and killed.” That the sons of Wittiza were at the time in Spain, nay, that Roderic  entrusted to them the command of the two wings of his army, is an assertion not only improbable, but  one which may easily be refuted. Setting aside the circumstance already recorded of their being mere  children when their father died and Roderic usurped the power (A.D. 709), which would incapacitate  them from assuming the command of troops in 711, Adh-dhobj and the best Arabian writers say that  they crossed over to Africa in order to obtain Miisa’s assistance in the reconquest of the throne of their  father; and although, their request being granted, they might have returned to their native country, it  is more natural to suppose that they joined Térik, than that they placed themselves in the hands of their  personal enemy, who must have been informed of their treason. If defection there was in the Gothic  army, as the Mohammedan and Christian writers universally agree, and as is affirmed by Isidorus (Esp.  Sag. vol. viii.), the Monk of Silos, and other Christian chroniclers, it must have been on the part of  Oppas, and others of their secret partisans, whom fear, or the wish of better accomplishing their treason,  still retained under Roderic’s orders,    69 Et equus qui Orelia dicebatur, says Rodrigo (De Reb. Hisp. lib. iii. cap. xxiii.) ; on what authority it is  not easy to say.    ge  7 ra =) aia3} his wounds exhausted him—perhaps both. In the fabulous chronicle of Rodrigo    (cap. ccxxxviii.), it is said that the Gothic monarch fled along the banks of the Guadalete, until his horse  having stuck in the mud he was obliged to dismount and proceed on foot, leaving behind him his  ornaments and royal insignia, for fear of being discovered.    7| Whether Roderic was slain by Térik as asserted (p. 273), whether he perished in the waters  of the river close to the field of battle, or contrived, as some historians assert, to fly from the field  and take refuge in Portugal, where he is said to have led a life of penance and contrition, are questions  which have hitherto exercised in vain the ingenuity of Spanish critics. Among the Mohammedan writers  the prevailing opinion is that Roderic was killed, although his body was never found. There are, it is  true, historians, like the one translated in the Appendix E. (p. lxxi.), those consulted by Conde (vol. i.  p. 32), and the anonymous writer translated by Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 326), who assert  that Roderic’s head was sent to Misa, who immediately dispatched a messenger with it to the Khalif ; but  is it likely that a fact of this importance, resting on good authority, should have been omitted by subsequent  historians? Among the Christians, Isidorus of Beja, and the continuator of the Chronicon Biclarense, the  only two contemporary writers, say that Roderic died on the field of battle. Sebastian of Salamanca, a  writer of the tenth century, was the first who, on the faith of an epitaph said to have been discovered two  hundred years after that event, advanced that Roderic escaped from the massacre, and retired to Viséo in  Portugal, where he passed the remainder of his days in penitence and prayer. The story has been  credited by the generality of the Spanish historians, from Rodrigo of Toledo down to Masdeu, but it is  no doubt one of the many pious frauds of which the tonsured chroniclers of the middle ages were often  guilty. Where was Roderic when Lusitania was overrun a year after by the Arabs? Why did he not  seek for refuge in the mountains of Asturias, where the relics of the Gothic nobility had congregated for  defence ?    7 This 28th day of Ramadh&n answers to the 19th day of July, a.p. 711, which was a Sunday. The  5th of Shawwél, therefore, fell on the 26th of the same month, likewise a Sunday.",598,,

Térik’s address to his soldiers, and the continual skirmishing  which preceded the general engagement, prove that the Gothic monarchy fell not without a struggle.  The Monk of Silos estimates Térik’s loss during the seven days at sixteen thousand men, a fourth more  than he is reported to have had.    7 Tt is difficult to say whether Sidonia is here meant for Medina-Sidonia or for Xerez, which some   . years afterwards received also the name of Shidiiniah. (See above, Note 63, p. 525.) Had the writer   given us the name of the town at the time of its reduction by Tarik, instead of that which it afterwards  received, much uncertainty might have been avoided. I think, however, that Xerez is here understood.    78 My copy reads 79) e— those in the British Museum ype This I believe to be the modern town    of Moron, which by the ancient chroniclers is written Moror.    7 Rodericus Toletanus makes Térik proceed first to Ezija, which must be a mistake, since Carmona  lay on his road to that city. The authors translated by Conde (vol. i. p. 37) say that Ezija was not  taken by Tarik, but by Zeyd Ibn Kesédi, one of his lieutenants. ,   Instead of a ‘ fountain,’ Rodericus says a ‘river: resedit Taric juzta fluvium Cilofontis, qui ex tunc dicitur  fons Tarici, lib. iii. cap. xxii, See also Cron. Gen. de Espana, fo. cciv. No river, however, in the  neighbourhood of Carmona bears now the name of that conqueror.    78 This anecdote is no doubt borrowed from Ibnu-l-ktittiyyah, in whose work I have read it. San  Pedro Pascual, who wrote towards the beginning of the fourteenth century, and who, during his captivity  at Granada, had opportunity to consult the writings of the Arabs, gives it also word for word. Nearly a  century before the Archbishop of Toledo had said, audientes quod gens advenerat que Gothorum gloriam sua  multitudine superarat et licet falso humanis vescebantur carnibus.   *         CHAPTER III.

Al-belddhori, in his Kitdbu-l-bolddn (Ar. MS. in the  Brit. Mus., No. 7496), furnishes me, within a few pages, with numerous instances of the word medinah    used in that sense.

[Book tv.    “ of Rejeb of the year 92; others say in Sha’ban, others in Ramadh4n (beginning July 21), answering to  “ the month of August of the Christians.” It is evident from what precedes, that instead of o> uw    “five nights being elapsed,” the copy of Ibnu-l-khattib consulted by Al-makkari read ee) Une!  “ five nights remaining,”—a mistake of frequent occurrence in Mohammedan books. The same observation  is applicable to the date of the 24th Rejeb, since the Mohammedans counting by nights, not by days, the  author who read “‘ five nights remaining” (Rejeb having thirty days) might think that the event was  fixed to the 24th. It now remains for us to ascertain which of the two dates, the 5th or the 8th, is the  right one. We have in favour of the first, Abu-l-fed4, Ibn Khallekan, Ibnu-]-khattfb himself, besides  the writers translated or consulted by Rodericus Toletanus and Conde. The second is defended only by  Tbnu-l-abbér and Adh-dhobi, but in my opinion it is the right one, and my reasons for thus be-  lieving are these. It is clear that Ibnu-l-khattib was guilty of a contradiction, since the 5th of Rejeb  could not be a Monday and a Thursday at once. By looking at the chronological tables of the Mo-  hammedan or lunar year drawn up by the indefatigable Masdeu, I find that the fifth of Rejeb was a  Monday, and therefore the Thursday immediately following it was the 8th. I may therefore advance,  without fear of contradiction, that the landing of Térik on the rock of Gibraltar took place on Thursday,  the 8th of Rejeb, a.. 92, answering to the 30th of April, a.p. 711.    3% The same obscurity is observed respecting this as the other actors in this interesting drama.  Most of the ancient chroniclers call this general Sancho, others Enecus (Eneco or Ifigo), both names  which are not Gothic but Basque. Isidorus calls him Theodomir, and adds that he was the same general  who, on a previous occasion, (during the reign of Egica,) had inflicted defeat on the Mohammedans,  while the Arabs say that the general who came to the assistance of the besieged at Ceuta was named  Alfonso. How are these accounts to be reconciled ?    38 See Appendix D., p. xlvi., where the landing of T4rik is given more in detail.    37 All the historians of Spain, Mohammedan as well as Christian, agree in placing Roderic away from  his capital, engaged in war, when the news of Térik’s invasion reached him; none, however, has specified  the cause or occasion of it. It is probable that he was employed in quelling some rebellion excited by the  partisans of the sons of Wittiza.    88 See p. 208, and Note 25, p. 487.

According to Conde (vol. i. p. 36), the division sent against Granada was under the orders of Zeyd Ibn  Kesfdi As-sekseki, who also took Ezija, and yet overtook Tarik before he reached Toledo.    3 All this is very obscure. If Térik himself took Ezija, his way to Toledo was not through Jaen, but  through Cordova. On the other hand, Jaen was then too inconsiderable a town to attract the attention  of the Berber general, while Ezija, the see of a bishop, a rich and wealthy city, where the relics of the  Gothic army, trusting in the strength of its walls, made a gallant defence, must in the first instance have  called his arms to that quarter. It is therefore probable that Jaen was taken by Zeyd, whose road to  Toledo, after returning from Malaga and Granada, must necessarily have been through that town.  According to Adh-dhob{ and other historians, Tarik himself went to Cordova, and remained before it  nine days, when, impatient of the delay, he intrusted to Mugheyth the siege of that city, and hastened on  to Toledo. This appears not only probable, but at once removes the difficulty.    4 A. says ap Kase 3 ‘in a forest of pine trees.’ My copy x«l4 FF) i Cu? ‘under    lofty pine trees.’ The word erz, whence the Spanish alerze with the article, means ‘a male pine.’  Al-ghaydah, ‘a forest,” has likewise passed into the Spanish algaida. .    5 That is to say, on the banks of the Guadalquivir, for the Arabs often gave to the rivers of Spain  names taken from the districts or tgwns through which they flow; so the Tagus was called ‘the river of  “ Toledo, Alcantara, Lisbon,” &c.

Ar-rdzi calls it Ja Iglesia de los Cautivos.    “ The text reads § ables or ¥,sJlb—now Talavera de la Reina. This town, however, is at too great a  distance from Cordova to lead to the supposition that Mugheyth would leave his army behind, and ride  off so far in pursuit of his enemy, who, in the fabulous chronicle of King Roderic, is called Pelistes.  Ar-razi says that Mugheyth overtook him at Collera, which he describes as a small hamlet not far from  Cordova. See also Amb. Morales, Cron.

Rodrigo, however, whose  work is for the most part a literal translation from the Arabic, as it is easy to discover even from the  Oriental turn of his sentences, followed the former account. He makes Malaga, as well as Murcia and  Granada, fall by the hands of Térik’s lieutenants.    Compare what I have said Note 69, p. 346, and Note 2, p. 529. The name of this city is here  written ab15 6 Karndttah.    '8 The practice so universally observed by the invaders of intrusting to the Jews the defence of the  cities and fortresses taken from the Christians, would, in the absence of any other fact, show that a  previous understanding must long have existed between them and the Berbers under the orders of Tarik,  and that the discontent or the ambition of Ilyén, the wrongs done to the sons of Wittiza, and the troubled  state of the Gothic monarchy, were not the only causes of the conquest of Spain. That the Jews of the  Peninsula had at different times been suspected of holding communication with those of Africa,—that in  the reign of Egica they had actually been accused, and to all appearance convicted, of inviting the Arabs  to make the conquest of Spain,—is sufficiently attested by the national writers. I have shown elsewhere  (Note 15, p. 511), on the authority of Ibnu Khaldin, that most of the Berber tribes inhabiting the northern  shores of Africa professed the Jewish religion; and although we are told that the twelve thousand men  which Misa placed under the orders of Tarik had previously been converted to the Mohammedan faith, and  duly instructed in ‘all the duties of their new religion by theologians appointed for that purpose, there is  every reason to suppose that their conversion was neither so sudden nor so sincere as to blot out  immediately all recollection of their former habits and religious ceremonies, and that they felt great  sympathy for their former brethren.

"    532 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book tv.    19 Fa Hy 3) Ouritewélah, now Orihuela, is supposed to be the ‘ Orcelis’ of the ancients. It would  appear from this, that Orihuela was then the capital of the kingdom, afterwards called ‘the country of  Theodomir.’ Indeed, I read in the Mandhiju-l-fakar, a work on astronomy and geography (Brit. Mus.,  No. 7483, fo. 190), that the ancient name for Orihuela was Tudmir, and that the city was so called from  its having been the residence of that chief. This by no means agrees with the account of Al-makkari  (p. 68, and Note 18, p. 376,) and other writers, among whom is the celebrated Wizir Ibnu-l-khattib,  who pretend that Murcia and Tudmir were one and the same town. This contradiction can only be  avoided by supposing Orihuela to have been called “the city of Theodomir,” either from the gallant  defence of that general, or from its having really become the capital of the states which he was allowed  to retain by capitulation. Murcia having in time become the capital of the extensive province called by  the Arabs pos ob ‘the land of Theodomir,’ was probably called peo [od] Kise ‘the capital of  [the country] Tudmir.’ Rodrigo (lib. iii. cap. xxiii.) says ‘ad urbem que tunc Oreola, nunc Murtia,  dicitur.’ But this could never be, Murcia and Orihuela being two distinct towns.    t  ; ry    2 We are not informed whether Theodomir was present or not at the battle of Guadalete. The whole  of what follows is not only obscure but contradictory. If the forces dispatched against Malaga and  Granada marched to Murcia after the taking of those cities,—if Theodomir made a gallant defence, and  stood a siege in his capital,—how could the troops reach Toledo in time to take part in the siege?   I cannot pass in silence a very curious circumstance respecting Theodomir, which I read in the Spanish  version of Ar-rézi, or at least in the copy which I have always used. Theodomir, or Tudemir, as he is  there called, is described as a renegade, who took the part of the Arabs, and fought under their banners.  He is said to have been sent with an army against Orihuela, which he besieged and took by capitulation,  after defeating its garrison in a sortie. Strange to say, the same stratagem which he is here said to have  put in practice to save his capital from the invaders, or to obtain advantageous terms, is there attributed  to the governor of the city besieged by Theodomir.    21 The whole of these conquests are a few lines lower attributed to ’Abdu-l-’aziz, son of Musa, who  did not arrive in Spain until one year after these events. The contradiction therefore is evident, and can  only be avoided by supposing that either Theodomir or the Arabs broke the treaties by which they were  mutually bound.    2 This passage has been given in the original Arabic, with a Latin translation, by Casiri, vol. ii. p. 251.  But, as usual, the learned librarian of the Escurial committed almost as many blunders as there are  words in it. Instead of in| Ezija he read ke~—instead of sty! Wore he printed Guse—and so  forth. :    % No Arabian writer that I know of has given the precise date of the taking of Toledo by Tarik ; it is  therefore next to impossible to determine what conquests were made by his lieutenants, during the period  which elapsed between the battle of Guadalete and the surrender of the Gothic capital, at which we are told  they were present. Lucas Tudensis, however, in his Chronicon Mundi (apud Schottum, Hisp. Illust. vol. iv.),  says, on what authority it would be useless to inquire, that Toledo was taken on the Palm-Sunday of a.p.  712, that is to say, on the 11th day of Jum4da 11., a.#. 93; namely, eight months or thereabout after  the victory on the plains of Xerez. During the interval, the forces which Térik dispatched to the west,",604,,

J, Wéda-l-hijdrah or Wida-l-hajirah is the ‘ amnis lapidum’ of Rodrigo. The city near  to which it flows was formerly called by the Arabs oP Ky do Medinatu-l-farj, (the city of the pass ?)    as we learn from Abii-l-fedé. The name of the river was afterwards given to the city itself. This fact is  corroborated by Rodrigo, who, in his Hist. Arab. p. 32, says Medina Alpharagel que nune dicitur  Guadalfajara.   Shehdbu-d-din Al-fisi, in his Kitdbu-l-jumdn fi akhbdri-z-zamdn, attributes the conquest of Guadalajara  to Mohammed Ibn Elias Al-mugheyli, one of Térik’s lieutenants.    2 The word é Jej means ‘a defile,’ a mountain pass; what the Spaniards now call puerto. It is    however but little used in this sense, and might in time have been replaced by 6ib, which has the same  meaning and is more appropriate. Bib-T4rik therefore might easily have been corrupted into Bibtrak  or Buitrago, a town which commands the mountain pass leading from New into Old Castile.    28 Rodrigo, who derived most of his information from the Arabian writers, says, mensam que habebat  trecentos sexaginta quinque pedes. I read likewise in the Cronica General, which is a compilation from the  same sources, e fallo una mensa luenga e molto ancha en que abia trezientos e sesenta pies, fo. ccv. Ar-razi,  however, says only, e fallé una messa que era de esmeralda messa e pies.    * Great obscurity prevails in the accounts of those writers who have mentioned the expedition  undertaken by Térik north of Toledo. Adh-dhobi says, that after the taking of Guadalajara, the Berber  general turned to the west, and having approached the chain of mountains called Ash-shérrdt (Sierra),  crossed it by a pass to which he gave his name (Fej-Ttirik), He then marched to the east, and took a  city called “the city of the table,” owing to his having found in it the table of Solomon. Thence he  proceeded southwards, and entered a town called a, é. e. Maya or Moya. Conde’s account (vol. i.  p. 45) differs materially from this; he makes T4rik first cross the mountains, and take a city to which he  gave his own name, then go to Guadalajara, &c. The Archbishop Rodrigo (lib. iii. cap. xxii.) and the  author of the Cronica General (fo. ccv.) differ still more. The former says, that after the taking of  Guadalajara, Tarik went to a mountain to which he gave the name of Jebal Suleymdn (mountain of  Solomon); for, although the text of the various editions reads ad montem qui dicitur Gebelculeman, et  imposuit ei nomem Gebeltaric, it is evidently vitiated, and Tarik ought to be substituted for Gebeltarik :  from thence to a city close to the mountain (Jebal Suleymin), where he found the table of Solomon,  whence the place was by him called Medrnat Al-meydah (the city of the table). After this, Tarik went to",605,,
"    534 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book tv.    Amaya or Moya, &c. So that while Conde, or the authors whom he followed, make Térik cross the  mountains twice, those consulted by Rodrigo, if his translation be correct, make no mention at all of his  crossing that mountain range. Adh-dhobi, and most of the historians of Mohammedan Spain, place the  city where the pretended table of Solomon was found on the other side of the Somosierra or chain of  mountains which divide the New from Old Castile. Rodrigo and the author of the Cronica General put  it on this side. How are these contradictory accounts to be reconciled? Could we but ascertain the real  situation of the cities called Medinat Al-meydah and 4s. Maya or &{.! Amaya by the Arabian writers,  we might, perhaps, hope to loose the knot of this difficulty. Rodrigo himself informs us, in his Hist.  Arab. ad calc. Erpen. p. 9, that the city, where, according to the Arabian writers, the table of Solomon  was found, stood close to Alcalé de Henares, at the foot of a mountain which in his time was called Gebel-  ¢uleman, and which still retains that name, though corrupted, in Cuesta de Zulema. I further learn from  a passage of Adh-dhobf, that ‘‘ the table was found at a spot not far from a city called Medinat En-achr  “ (the city of the river),” which, from a strong castle in after times built for its defence, might easily have  changed its name into Al-kal’ah En-nahr or Alcalé de Henares (the castle of the river), its present name;  to which may be added, that the stream which waters its walls is also called ‘‘ Henares,” a corruption from  Nahr or En-nahr (river). This would at once show that the table was found about three miles from  Alcalé de Henares, on or close to the spot now called Cuesta de Zulema, where a town, known to the  Arabs as Medfnat Al-meydah, must have stood, though it might have been destroyed before the age of  Rodrigo. To this place Sindered, and those among the Christian prelates and noblemen who quitted  Toledo on the approach of Térik, might have fled with the ornaments and relics of the churches, and  Térik have followed them in the hope of making a good booty. Among the objects which then fell  into the conqueror’s hands, was a table of precious materials, which some Jewish tradition referred  to the sack of Jerusalem, whence the city was called ‘“‘the city of the table,” and the mountain  close to which it stood Jebal Suleymdn (the mountain of Solomom). There is nothing improbable  in all this,—it bears even all the appearance of truth; but how are we to reconcile it with the accounts  of the Arabs, who place the city where the table was found beyond the mountains of Somosierra,  which they all agree Térik crossed on this occasion,—by a pass, too, which still retains his name?  There is still another difficulty to be surmounted in Rodrigo’s account. How could Térik go first to  Guadalajara and thence to Alcal4, if he must inevitably have passed through the latter on his way  to the former city? On the other hand, what do the Arabs mean by Maya,—Radrigo by Amayera and  Amaya,—the Cronica General by Moya,—the city where the relics of the Gothic government are said to  have fied on the approach of Térik? There is a place called Amaya on the limits of the province of  Burgos and Santander, but this is too far for my purpose. A hamlet called Amayas, in the province of  Guadalajara and the bishopric of Siguenza, might be the town alluded to, were it not that it lies in an  opposite direction from the route taken by Térik, who, in crossing the Somosierra at Buitrago, went away  from it. The town of Moya, long the capital of a considerable district, might well have been the place  where the fugitives of Toledo fled for an asylum ; it is thus stated by the author of the Cronica General ;  but there are two very strong objections to be put to the statement, namely, that Moya lies to the east,  not to the west of Toledo, and that in order to penetrate thither Térik must have crossed a different chain  of mountains, namely, the Sierra de Molina. Secondly, that it is not probable that the people of Toledo  should have fied in a direction which brought them nearer to the provinces already overrun by Térik’s  lieutenants, whilst the road to Galicia or Asturias, which soon after became the bulwark of the Spanish  liberties, was open to them. The author of Cartas para ilustrar la historia de Espana, p. liii., thought of  remedying this difficulty by supposing the Medinat Al-meydah of the Arabs to have been a small castle  called Mesa, which, at an early period of Spanish history, stood on the banks of a river called also Rio",606,,
"    CHAP. III.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 535    Mesa, which divides the Senorio de Molina from the Ducado de Medinaceli. But this supposition, besides  being a very gratuitous one, and resting on no other foundation than the curious coincidence of the names  of the castle and of the river being a translation of the Arabic word meydah (table), by no means removes  the objection. Others, like Masdeu, have imagined that the town of Medinaceli was the place where Térik    found the table; but Medinaceli is a corruption from ple ude Medinat-Selim, as that town was called    by the Arabs from the name of its founder, and has nothing in common with the Medinat-Al-meydah  mentioned by the Arabian writers.   There is only one way of reconciling the different statements of these authors, which is to suppose that  Tarik, on his way to Amayas or Moya (either town will do for my conjecture), went first to Alcala, where  he met with a party of fugitives, and seized upon the table of Solomon, and that on his return from his  expedition he crossed the mountains at Buitrago, and proceeded to Galicia,—Guadalajara being, during  this interval, reduced by a party of his men under the orders of one of his lieutenants, as has elsewhere  been stated (Note 26, p. 533). This is rendered probable by the fact that most of the Arabian writers, as  Al-makkari himself observes lower down, make Térik march, without stopping, to Astorga.    ® Various are the dates assigned by the Arabian writers for Miisa’s landing on the coast of Spain.  All however agree that it took place in the year 93, with the exception of Cardonne (vol. i. p. 85), who  by some unaccountable oversight places that event in 96. The anonymous writer translated in the  Appendix E., p. Ixxi., says on a Thursday of the month of Safar, a.H. 93, (that is to say, either on the  18th of November or on the 25th of the same month, or on the 2nd or 9th of December, which were  Thursdays.) Ibn Habfb says in Juméda 1., 93, (February or March, 712;) while Conde (vol. i. p. 35)  fixes it to the month of Rejeb, (April or June, 712.) In the fragment attributed to Ar-razi by Casiri  (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 319, et seg.) I find the date of Ramadh4n, 93, (June or July, 712;) which  is also that given by Rodrigo and the Cronica General. So that according to these various authorities the  arrival of Musa happened between the 30th of November, a.p. 711, which was the first Thursday of  the lunar month of Safar, and the 20th of July, which was the last day of Ramadhan, a period of about  ten solar months. It is clear, however, that if Muisa passed one month before Seville,—if the siege of  Merida, protracted by the vigorous defence of its garrison, lasted some months,—if this latter city  surrendered, as is generally asserted, on the first day of Shaww4l,—the dates of Rejeb and Ramadhan  cannot for a moment be thought of; since in the short interval of three months in the first instance,  or of only one in the second, Musa could not have accomplished what on the testimony of all the  Mohammedan and Christian writers occupied him several months. It now remains to ascertain which of  the two dates, that of the anonymous writer translated in the Appendix or that of Ibn Habib, is the  correct one. Both authors are deserving of credit: the former, for the circumstantial evidence and  numerous details he gives, which are not to be found elsewhere ; the latter, because he flourished towards  the middle of the ninth century, and because, having written a short treatise on the invasion and  conquest of Spain by the Arabs, it is to be presumed that he considered his subject well before he fixed  a date for an event of so much importance. We have, therefore, to choose between two authors equally  well qualified, and both entitled to our consideration. Were I called upon to decide, I would pronounce  in favour of Ibn Habib; but I think that the discrepancy may be thus obviated. The anonymous writer  translated in the Appendix does not say positively that Musa sailed in the month of Safar, but that he    °    .  fixed the departure for a Thursday of that month: ENO 5 \ses Uae Kus 5 ol 3 50    Del Os) Gane ae al ey a Sel ob came 9 WE Re fo cp Besides, it is not",607,,

[BOOK Iv.    probable that in the short interval between the battle of the Gaudalete and his departure from Africa,—  scarcely four months,—Muia could have collected together a sufficient number of vessels for the transport  of twelve thousand horse, the lowest number at which his army has been computed. The operation might  therefore have begun in Safar, and ended in Jumé4da 1., a period of two months; and thus the accounts  of the two historians might be reconciled.    ‘l The opinion that Tarik did not on this occasion go further than Amaya or Maya is the most  probable, as well as that which I find more generally entertained by the Arabian writers.    32 The number of royal diadems said to have been found in the principal church at Toledo varies from  twenty-four to twenty-seven. The anonymous writer translated in the Appendix E, (p. lxxii.) gives  the former number; Al-khazraji (Appendix D. p. xviii.) and Ibn Habib say twenty-five; Al-makkari  himself states them, as well as the padlocks, at twenty-seven, (see p. 262,) one for each king who  reigned in Spain. It is evident that the latter computation is the most correct ; for although it be true that  including Theodomir and his son Althanagild, the number of kings of northern descent who reigned in  Spain will be found to be thirty-six, as elsewhere stated (p. 27), yet if we consider that the first six  ruled, properly speaking, in Gaul, not in Spain, and that neither Roderic nor his two successors are  included in the list, we shall find their number reduced to twenty-seven.    %3 Rodrigo and the authors of the Cronica General adopted the former computation. The writers  consulted by Conde (vol. i. p. 34) and Cardonne (vol. i. p. 18) say ten thousand infantry and eight  thousand horse.    § This is the same individual mentioned at Note 3, p. 372.

In their number were Al-munayzir, ’Ali Ibn Rabi’ Al-lakhmi, and Ibn Rejé At-temimi.  But of this more will be said in the second volume of this translation.    38 Al-makkari was here guilty of two unpardonable blunders: first, in supposing that ‘ Jebal Musa’  (the mountain of Moses) took its name from Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, instead of the Jewish legislator ; secondly,  in placing it in Spain instead of Africa. This glaring error, however, cannot be solely charged on  Al-makkari, since it may also be met with in Idrisi, and other writers of note. Al-bekri (fo. 76) and  other African geographers treat of a sea-port between Tangiers and Ceuta called Mersa Miisa (the port  of Moses), owing to the neighbouring seas abounding in fish of the species called by Ad-demiri and  other naturalists Hut Miisa (the fish of Moses). A mountain close to it was also called ‘ the mountain  of Moses.’ According to Abi Haémid Al-andalusi, ‘‘ Moses and his servant Joshua started once on @",608,,

I once saw the fish,” adds Abi Hamid; “it measured about one cubit in length,  “‘ but no more than one inch in’ thickness; one of its sides was provided with fins, and with large  “and small bones as the other fishes; its intestines, as well as its eyes, were covered with a very  “* tender and delicate skin; its head was only the half of one.” It is further related by the K4di ’Iyédh  in his history of Ceuta, ‘‘ that Moses and his servant Joshua met with Elias (Al-khadhr) at Jezirah  « Al-khadhrdé (Algesiras), which spot was since denominated after that prophet.” Hence the author,  misled by the similarity of the names, thought that Jebal Misa received its name from the conqueror  of Spain.    39 Bee) wie Jord ql literally ‘the barbarians acting as guides from among the people of    lly4n.’ Another account makes Misa say to them: spl pt) I, we Gio ALY eis &  « I shall not take the same road which T4rik took, or follow his footsteps.’ The author of the Reyhdnu-  J-lebdéb says that it was Ily4n in person who acted as guide to Miisa.   This being the last time that Ily4n is mentioned by Al-makkari, I have purposely delayed until now the  statement of my opinion on that individual, from a wish to collect together and compare the various ac-  counts given by the Arabian writers. In the present note, therefore, I propose to investigate the following  points. 1. At what period, and by whom, was the name of Ily4n first introduced into Spanish history ?  nu. Did a man so called ever exist? 111. What were his country and religion? 1v. Was he an  independent prince, or a tributary of the Gothic monarchs? v. What part did he take in the conquest of  Spain by the Arabs ?   1. I have already observed that Ily4n thus written ys could never have been intended for Julian by  the Arabian writers; for, although I have met with that name written in a variety of ways, owing to the  mistakes of the copyists,—.,\, Balbdn, wh Balydn, lis) Al-balydn, and ys! Al-ilydn,—I have  not found it once written wWy —the real spelling, had Julian been meant. The most common, and I    sce    believe the most correct way of writing his name, is 45] Elyéno [lianus?]—Thus I find it in    Al-bekri, Sheh4bu-d-din Al-fés{, and occasionally in Ibnu Khaldiin; but as Al-makkari invariably writes  it Ny4n,—as both the author of the Cronica General, and San Pedro Pascual, (In sectam Mahometanam,  cap. vii. p. 48,) who borrowed their narrative from Arabian sources, have Illan,—I have not hesitated  in writing it as above, although, had I merely consulted my own inclination, I should undoubtedly have  printed Elian.   The Monk of Silos, who wrote towards the beginning of the twelfth century, and who was the author of  a chronicle beginning with the invasion of Spain by the Arabs, and ending with the reign of Alfonso VI.,  is the first Spanish author who mentions Ily4n, whom he calls Julianus. Neither Isidorus Pacensis, nor  the continuator of the Chronicon Biclarense, two contemporary writers, nor Sebastianus Salmanticensis,  who flourished towards the middle of the ninth century, nor the Monk of Albelda, who wrote in  a.p. 883, make the least mention of him. From this fact, Masdeu and most of the modern Spanish  critics have concluded that the character of Ilyén or Julian was altogether one of that chronicler’s  invention, and that no such person ever existed. Others, like the author of Cartus para ilustrar la  historia de Espana, who, though an Arabic scholar, was not much of a critic, being unable to deny the    VOL. I. 3 Zz",609,,
"    538 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book Iv.    fact of the name of Ilyan occurring in the writings of the Arabs long before the age of the Monk of Silos,  have imagined that Julian was a corruption for Khuldn, the name of a Berber general who entered Spain  at the same time with Térik, and who, having afterwards revolted with the troops under his command,  was taken prisoner and executed in a.H. 101. But IJ shall be able to prove that the assumption of the  latter author is as unfounded as the charge brought by the former against the Christian chronicler.   The mere inspection of this part of the Chronicon Silense (Florez, Esp. Sag. vol. xvii. p. 278) is  sufficient to impress one with the conviction that the account there given of Count Julian could not have  originated in the head of its author, but must have been either read in the work of some Arabian  writer, or communicated to him by some Christian well versed in the writings of the Moslems; and no  one who peruses with attention the extracts printed in the Appendix D., and compares them with the  eighteenth chapter in Rodrigo’s work, will for a moment hesitate to say that the whole of the latter is a  literal translation from some Arabian writer. But were this not sufficient to repel the imputation cast  upon the author of the Chronicon Silense, and to convince those who believe the whole account to be a  forgery of the Christians, who communicated it to the Arabs, some unanswerable proofs might be  brought to bear in favour of my proposition. Besides Ibnu Hayydén, who preceded the Christian writer  upwards of one century, I can adduce the testimony of Al-bekri, a writer of the eleventh century, of  Ibnu-l-kuttiyyah and Ibn Haukal, who wrote in the tenth, and of Ibn Khordddbah and Al-beladhori,  geographers of the ninth century, all of whom mention more or less explicitly the existence of a man  living in Africa, and named Ilyén, who helped the Arabs to make the conquest of Spain; to which I  ought to add, that the rape of Ilyén’s daughter, and the circumstances attending it, may also be read in  detail in the Mohammedan authors who preceded the Monk of Silos. fa   As to the opinion entertained by the author of Cartas para ilustrar la historia de Espaha, p. xiii. et  passim, that a Berber, named Khuldn, (a word, he says, afterwards corrupted into Julian by the Arabs,)  gave rise to the fabulous episode of Ily4n, it is certainly not entitled to more credit. Khaulén, (for such  was his name, not Khulén,) if a Berber, must have received that name from his being adopted by the  Arabian tribe of the Beni Khaulén, to which belonged many of the conquerors of Spain, and the head of  which was As-samh Ibn Malik Al-khaulanf, the third governor of Mohammedan Spain, after the  assassination of ’Abdu-l-’aziz by the orders of the Khalif Suleyman. Some individual of that illustrious  family was probably the founder of a castle which Abi-1l-fed4é, in his Geography, calls Kal’ah Khaulda  (the castle of Khaulén), and which once stood close to Algesiras; the name of which suggested to  Father Labat, who visited its ruins in 1731, the idea that it had been once the residence of Don Julian.  See Voyages en Espagne et en Italie, chap. vii.   Having so far proved that the episode of Ily4n was not altogether an invention, and that if fiction was  mixed with it, it is to be ascribed to the Arabs, not to the Christians, I shall now proceed to examine  what amount of historical evidence in its favour may be gathered in the writings of the Arabs.   u. That a man named Ilyén, whom some, like Ibnu-]-kuttiyyah, call ‘‘a merchant” (see Note 23,  p- 512), others ‘‘a king of the African tribe of Ghomérah,” and the greater number ‘‘ Lord of Ceuta and  Tangiers,” ruled as master from the port of Los Velez (or Ghom4rah as the Arabs call it) to the Straits  of Gibraltar many years before the first invasion of Spain by the Arabs, is a fact resting on too good  authority to be at all brought into question. Al-bekr{, Idrisi, Ibnu Hayy4n, Ibnu Khaldun, and the best  writers of Mohammedan Spain, assert that ‘‘ when ’Okbah Ibn Néfi’ invaded Western Africa, the  “ Governor or Lord of Ceuta, whose name was Ily4n, the same who years afterwards led Térik into  «« Spain, came out to meet him with presents, and asked for peace, which the Arabian general granted,  ‘leaving the Christian in possession of the city and of his other estates.” The first-mentioned writer  (Brit. Mus., No. 7534, fo. 77), in his description of Ceuta and the surrounding districts, often speaks of",610,,
"    CHAP. I1I.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 539    a river called Nahr Ilyén, which appears to be the same as the Guadalefo of Menezes, Hist. de Tangere,  pp. 6, 92, et passim, as well as of a palace (Kasr Ilydn), and of an aqueduct (’Ayn-Ilydn) ; which that  geographer observes were so called after a king who ruled in those districts when the Arabs settled in  the country, and who was much beloved and respected by his subjects, on account of his justice and  praiseworthy conduct.   *Okbah invaded Africa twice,—the first time in a.H. 46, under the Khalifate of Mua’wiyah Ibn Abi  Sufyan ; the second in a.#. 62, under that of his son Yezid. In his first expedition “Okbah did little  else but retake the city of Cyrene, which had fallen into the hands of the Berbers; but, on his return to  Africa, he traversed the whole continent from Alexandria to Tangiers, and his victorious progress was  only arrested by the waves of the Atlantic, into which, finding no more land to conquer, he is reported to  have madly plunged his horse. From the appearance of ’Okbah before the walls of Ceuta in a.n. 62 to  the year 90, when we first hear of Ily4n on the stage of Spanish history, only twenty-eight years elapsed,  which does not render it at all improbable that the Ily4n who made peace with ’Okbah, and he who led  the Arabs into Spain, were, as Al-bekri affirms, one and the same person.   111, This point once settled, it remains for me to investigate what were his country and religion. As to  his country, most of the Arabian writers call him a ‘ Berber,’ but some a ‘Rimi’ (Roman). Among  the Christian authors, some, like Mendez de Silva (Poblacion de Espana), say that he was born in Italy ;  others, as Rustant (Hist. de los Arabes, p. 20), that he was a Greek, and a traitor to the Emperor of  Constantinople ; some have gone so far as to make him a Goth, and a scion of the royal blood of Spain.  It is evident, however, that those among the Arabian authors who called him a Berber, were misled  by the titles of ‘ King of the Berbers,’ ‘ Prince of the tribe of Ghom4rah,’ &c., under which the African  writers generally designate him; whilst those who, like the Archbishop of Toledo, made him a connexion  of Roderic, did it without the least shade of authority. In my opinion those writers who call him a  Rimi are nearest the truth; since, according to the meaning of this word among the African historians,  (see p. 511,) it may equally mean ‘a Roman’ and ‘a Greek.’ Ily4n no doubt belonged to that mixed  population,—the relics of all the nations that had empires on the coast of Africa after the fall of  Carthage,—Romans, Numidians, Vandals, and Greeks,—a people in whose hands were all the ports and  fortified towns at the time of the Saracen invasion, and whom the African historians invariably designate  under the collective name of ‘ Rim,’ because they were thought to be the subjects of the Roman empire.  As to his religion, all the Mohammedan writers, without one exception, agree in making him a Christian,    ol | pai |—a fact which renders inadmissible the suggestion brought forward by some of the writers,    “that Tly4n had, previously to his treason, forsaken the Christian religion and embraced that of his  “allies.”   tv. Was Ily4n an independent prince, or a tributary of the Gothic kings? is a question by no means  so easy to answer. That the Goths claimed the supremacy over a portion of the African coast,  appears to be an ascertained fact; but whether this claim arose from any real possession of that country  gained at an early period, or from the want in which the Greek governors of the ports of Africa, at the  time of the invasion of the Arabs, must have found themselves, of a powerful ally, is a point which is far  from being settled. Rodrigo and the Monk of Silos tell us that the Goths ruled in Tingitania; but neither  in the Byzantine nor in the Visigothic historians are the origin and cause of their power explained. What  meagre facts we possess we have from the Arabian historians. We are told that at the time of the  invasion of Africa by ’Abdullah Ibn Sa’d (a.H. 27), a Greek named Gregorius, who held his court at  Subeytalah, was governing that country from Tripoli to Tangiers, in the Greek emperor’s name.  Gregorius having been killed at the battle of Ya’ktbah, another Greek general succeeded him, whom  the African authors call Artiyiin Hawdjah. After his death, which was quickly followed by the fall of",611,,
"    540 NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. [Book Iv.    Carthage and other important places, we no longer hear of Greek supremacy; for, although the  emperors of Constantinople made some efforts to regain their African dominions, either their fleets  foundered at sea, or their armies, wherever they landed, were utterly destroyed. In the confusion that  ensued, such among the Greek governors as still retained possession of the cities intrusted to their care,—  and in this number Ily4n as well as a certain Requila or Rixila must be counted,—seeing the tempest  gathering over their heads, must naturally have looked up for assistance to the Gothic monarchs, and  become tributaries to their empire. Still the ties which united them with Spain must have been so weak  as to be easily loosened, according as their fear or private interest dictated. On the appearance of the  conqueror ’Okbah before the walls of Ceuta, Ily4n went out to meet the Mohammedan general, and suc-  ceeded by his hasty submission in arresting the progress of the victor through his estates. Ibnu Khaldtin  (Joco laudato, fo. 96, verso,) adds, that he led the Arabian general to the countries watered by the river Siis,  and to the regions inhabited by the Al-mulaththamin, or the wearers of the veil called latham, the whole  of which ’Okbah subdued. It is even asserted by Shehabu-d-din Al-fasi, an African historian of note,  that ’Okbah, after his entrance into Tangiers, another city under Ily4n’s sway, having expressed a wish to  cross over to Spain, that chief dissuaded him from the undertaking, on the plea that it would be madness  to thrust himself with his army into the midst of a populous empire, unless he had previously subdued the  whole of his African enemies. (See Not. et Ext. des MSS. de la Bib. du Roi, vol. ii. p. 157.) In the  period of time which elapsed between Ily4n’s treaty with 'Okbah and the arrival of Musa to take charge  of the government of Africa, the Berbers, under their queen, Kéhinah, defeated the Moslems in several  encounters, and took from them most of their strong places. During this interval Ily4n seems to have  shaken off the yoke of the Arabs, for we are told (p. 253) that Miisa was obliged to send against him,  to Tangiers, his freedman Tarik, whilst he himself besieged Ceuta, a city which, being relieved by troops  from Spain, made a stout defence. We are also told that, after the death of Wittiza, Ily4n surrendered ;  and here we may surmise that, seeing the sceptre of the Goths pass into the hands of an usurper, and  instigated, perhaps, by the legitimate heirs, he made his peace with the Arabs, and opened to them the  gates of the Peninsula; to which may be added, that Mrisa, who had long been thinking of invading  Spain, could not accomplish his purpose otherwise than by gaining possession of Ceuta, and thereby  becoming master of a sufficient number of vessels to transport his troops to the opposite shore. On the  surrender of Ceuta, the Arabian general, therefore, after taking hostages from Ily4n, imposed upon him  the condition of providing him with a certain number of vessels, while he himself joined in the enter-  prise, as the best means of dethroning the usurper and restoring the sons of Wittiza to the throne of  their father.   It is therefore natural to conclude that Ily4n or #lianus, if at all dependent upon the Gothic monarchs,  was not, properly speaking, their subject. The title of Comes Spathariorum, which Rodericus and other  historians give him, he may have had, as it was the custom of the Visigothic kings to confer upon their  vassals honorific titles. It is by no means so easy to account for the title of ‘foreign merchant,’ which  Tbnu-l-kittiyyah, an historian of the tenth century of the Hijra, gives him, unless his having a fleet, and  his being the means of transmitting to Spain the several productions of Africa, suggested that idea to the  Mohammedan writer,—a suggestion which derives no small strength from the fact that the vessels  furnished to Térik by Ily4n are elsewhere said to have been ‘ merchant vessels.”   v. I shall not stay to consider the part taken by Ily4n in the conquest of Spain, as there is nothing in  that event, as related by the Mohammedan writers, which tends in the least degree to impair the historical  evidence which I have adduced in his favour. That he should be made to invade first, and merely with  his own troops, the country whither he advised Musa to carry his arms, is not only probable, but highly  consistent with the prudence shown on every occasion by that wary gencral, who, according to Ibnu",612,,
"         CHAP. 111.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 541    Khaldtn (fo. 96), had previously received several hostages, in whose number was a son of the Christian  chief. That he should accompany Tarif, and land with him at Tarifa,—that he should also make part of  Térik’s expedition,—be present at the battle in which Roderic’s army was defeated, and advise Tarik upon  the best course to be followed,—that he should afterwards return to Africa, lead Misa to Spain, and be  at the siege of Carmona,—are all facts which contain not the least shadow of improbability.   Upon Ily4n’s ultimate destination and end, all the Arabian historians which I have consulted keep  silence; and after the siege of Carmona, which was taken by a stratagem of his own device, we no longer  hear of him. It is probable, however, that he returned to his government of Ceuta, and died in  possession of it, though a tributary to the Arabs; for I read in Ibnu Khaldin, fo. 96, verso, the following  particulars. ‘After the death of Ilyén, the Arabs took away Ceuta from his people [his heirs], and  “settled in it. After this came the civil war kindled by the wretch Meysarah, and the propagation  “‘ of his heterodox doctrines, which numbers of Berbers of the tribe of Gomera and other tribes em-  “ braced; when, profiting by the dissension between the Berbers and the Arabs, the Berbers of Tangiers  “ attacked Ceuta, and expelled from it the Arabs, destroying the city and converting it into a desert.    “In this state Ceuta continued, until Ute Majikus? (Al-bekri, fo. 76, writes his name ele  “« Mjikan,) one of their noblest chiefs and bravest warriors, the same who built the city of Kuk  “ Majkisah, and gave it his own name, came and settled in the deserted city, the ancient inhabitants  “ returning to it from every part of the country. This Méjikus, however, having listened to the voice  “of the Arabian theologians and doctors, was in time converted to Islam. After his death, a son of  “his, named ’Issém, succeeded him, and ruled for some time. ’Issém was succeeded by his son pst  “ Mojir, ( (as Mijbar or Mujabbir in Al-bekri,) after whose death a brother of his, or, according to  “ other authorities, a son, named Ar-radhf, inherited his power.”   I have now given all the evidence to be found in the writings of the Arabian authors to which I have  had access. There can, however, be no doubt that much more might be collected from works now  either lost to us, or lying forgotten upon the shelves of some library; and had we a copy of a history of  Ceuta which ’ly4dh Ibn Miisa Ibn ’ly4dh Al-yahsebi, a Granadine writer of the twelfth century, who    was a judge in that city, is reported to have written under this title, cu. jue! AP kewl! wall    ‘the seven divisions on the history of Ceuta,’ we might hope to see some of the obscurity which still  covers the deeds of Ily4n entirely dissipated. As it is, there is nothing improbable in these events,  attested as they are by the greater number of the Arabian historians; for although it may be objected  that neither the Monk of Balclara, a contemporary writer, nor Isidorus Pacensis, who wrote forty-two  years after these events, nor the ancient historian whose account I have given translated in the Ap-  pendix E., mention one word about Ily4n, the omission may be easily accounted for: on the part of the  Arabian writer, from an unwillingness to give to an infidel any share in the glorious undertaking ; and on  that of the Christian chroniclers, because they either did not attach any great importance to it, or were  the partisans of Wittiza,—a presumption which, with regard to Isidorus, is by no means unjustifiable,  though by him Ily4n might well be included under that clause, gui cum eo emulanter fraudulenterque ob  ambitionem regni advenerant.

If Misa landed at Algesiras, as it is generally believed, Medina-Sidonia lay on his way  to Carmona; but he must also have passed through Xerez, especially if he went ‘along the sea coast.”  Perhaps Xerez having been already taken and plundered by Tarik, Musa would not enter it. Rodrigo  and the author of the Cronica General say positively that the city taken by Musa was Medina-Sidonia ;  but in this, as in other instances, their authority cannot be of much weight, since their works are a  mere compilation from the Arabian historians.

On such occasions it is customary for the Moslems to put on their  most costly garments, to dress their beards, &c. This no doubt led to the story of Miisa’s beard,  which is repeated by Rodrigo and the author of the Cronica General. On this day, a.a. 94, which  answers to the 10th of July, a.p. 712, Musé is said, lower down, to have taken Merida, but this date is  no doubt erroneous ; for if Miisa landed in Ramadhén 93, as the author asserts, how could he have spent  upwards of one year in the reduction of a few towns? On the other hand, if Miiea left Spain for Africa  in Dhi-l-hajjah of the same year (4.4. 93), how could he, in the short space of three months, go from  Mcrida to Toledo, have an interview with Térik, proceed to Saragossa, which he besieged and took,  invade Catalonia, conquer part of Galicia, and, lastly, return to Algesiras, to embark for Africa ?   Both Rodrigo and the author of the Cronica General have adopted the date of 94, but the authors  consulted by Conde (vol. i. p. 44) and Casiri (vol. ii, p. 322), Ibn Habib, the author of the Reyhdnu-  l-lebéb, Al-homaydi, Adh-dhobf, in fact, all Arabian writers who mention the siege of Merida, refer it  to the year 93. It is therefore quite clear, that either Al-makkarf or the author he quotes was mistaken,  and that the date here assigned is an erroneous one; but as I make a point of never altering the text,  I have suffered it to remain.    *9 Hinna or hennd, whence the Spanish words alhefa, alifo, alitar, &c. are derived, is the shrub called  cyprus or privet, a decoction of whose branches is used by the Arab women to dye their nails and  eyelids.   » er according to Ibnu-l-beyttar is a plant which grows in the deserts of Arabia, and has the  branches of a deep red.    5!

[Book Iv.    57 The origin here assigned to this table is far more probable than the gratuitous supposition of  Gibbon, who imagined it to have been formerly in Jerusalem, to have been carried away by Titus at  the sack of that city, and, lastly, to have fallen into the hands of the Goths at the taking of Rome by  Alaric.    58 ws in A.—B. reads ls the plural of us 8 “a throne, a chair.’    59 The word which I have translated by ‘ altars’ is remarkable— el i.e. ‘ sacrificing places.’    © T need not advert to the contradiction. If the table was found, as here stated, at Toledo, how could  a city be called Medinat Al-meydah from the fact of Solomon’s table being found in it? Ibnu Hayyén,  however, is not the only writer who says that the precious relic was found at Toledo. Idrisi (clim. iv.  sect. 1) confirms the statement, and Al-makkari himself has elsewhere quoted the words of a writer who  entertains the same opinion ; but is it likely, I ask, that the Bishop Sindered, and those who accompanied  him in his flight, should have left behind them so valuable an object ?    61 Said elsewhere (see Appendix E., p. Ixxix.) to be a dining table, without feet. Nothing about this  is to be read in the ancient writer there translated.    CHAPTER IV.    ! It is probable that, after the taking of Saragossa, Miisa penetrated further into the country. Conde,  or rather the historians consulted by him, make Musa follow a route different from that of Térik. They  say that the Berber general proceeded eastwards, while Musa journeyed northwards to Salamanca and  Astorga ; whence, following the course of the river Douro, he joined Térik before the walls of Saragossa.  This is more probable; a man of Miisa’s ambition could not well consent to follow the track of his  lieutenant, and enter cities already plundered by him. From Saragossa Musa is reported by the same  historians to have followed the northern bank, while Térik ravaged the cities on the opposite side.    2 The MS. in the British Museum has wl Fy ji —my copy (yyso| —which is undoubtedly meant  for Avenione (Avignon). This applies not to Térik himself, but to the Berbers who came with him to  the conquest of Spain; for, as I shall show hereafter, no invasion of the French territory was made until  nearly ten years after the battle of Guadalete. :    5 A farsang is generally computed at three miles.    4 It has been asserted by several Arabian historians that Misa crossed the Pyrenees and penetrated  into France, but as no mention whatever of this invasion occurs in the Christian writers of the age, who  cannot be all accused of negligence, I am inclined to believe that the whole account originated in a  mistake. When the Arabs first invaded Spain they gave the name of Afranj (Franks) to the people  dwelling on the eastern branch of the Pyrenees, and that of Jalalkak (Galicians) or Bashkans (Basques)  to those of the western. It is owing to this reason that we see writers of the twelfth and thirteenth",616,,
"    CHAP. Iv.] NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 545    centuries, when the distinction must have been better understood by them, still calling Catalonia and  Upper Aragon, Ardhu-l-faranj (the land of the Franks); Galicia and Asturias, Ardhu-l-jalalkah (the land  of the Galicians); and Navarre and Biscay, Ardhu-l-bushkans (the land of the Basques). All the  countries lying beyond the Pyrenees were at the same time designated by the generic appellation of  Ardhu-l-kebirah (the great land or continent), owing, no doubt, to their calling Spain an island; and  when the author chose to refer to France in particular, the words Ardhu-l-faranj, or in later times  Afaranjah, were used. Catalonia having been frequently overrun, even conquered by the French in the  first century after the invasion, this contributed no little to rivet upon it the name of Ardhu-l-faranj,  which it retained, conjointly with Upper Aragon, even long after it had ceased to be a Mohammedan  province. It is therefore probable, not to say certain, that the authors who assert, like the present,  that Misa invaded the French territory, had no other foundation for their statement than the name  of Ardhu-l-faranj (land of the Franks), generally given to Catalonia.    5 One of the copies reads “‘ sons of Israel,""""—the mistake is evident.    6 This inscription is given by the author of the Ja’rdfiyyah, who says that it was found at Narbonne.  Cardonne, (vol. i. p. 94,) who treats of this column, but without giving the inscription, says that it was  erected by Musa to fix the limit of his conquests.    7 One of the copies reads “ Granada,” but it is evidently a mistake.    8 Another account says that they were equestrian statues of massive silver. See Cardonne, vol. i.  p. 105, and Conde, vol. i. p. 55; both of whom borrowed it from An-nuwayri.    ® The Arabs not unfrequently imagined that the names assumed by the Christian monarchs were like  those of their own sovereigns, patronymics or family names. It is therefore not an uncommon thing for  them to call all the kings of Asturias, Ludherik; those of Castile, Adfunsh ; those of Aragon, Jaymish ;  those of France, Kdroloh, &c.    vo wpe Beladiun, ‘the inhabitants of towns.’ This name is given by the Arabian genealogists    to certain tribes of Arabs who lived in cities, and were thereby considered legs illustrious than the  Nomadis.    | These towns are said elsewhere to have been reduced by T4rik’s lieutenants, but the present account  appears to be more authentic. In general it is difficult to say which cities were taken by Miisa and  which had surrendered to Térik before his arrival ; since the Arabian writers have often attributed to one  the conquests of the other. As to the Christian authors, they are of little or no service to us: Isidorus  Pacensis and the continuator of the Chronicon Biclarense throw no light whatever on this subject, and the  loss of Spain, like all national catastrophes, is by them painted in two strokes. As to Rodrigo and the  author of the Cronica General, they give generally more details, but their works being translations or com-  pilations from Arabian sources, their evidence loses much of its value in settling any contested point. Were  I called upon to choose between these contradictory opinions, I would follow the latter, since the difficulty  might easily be removed by supposing Malaga, as well as Granada and Tudmir, to have fallen, like Beja, into  the hands of the Christians during the period of time which elapsed between their reduction by Tarik’s  lieutenants and the arrival of Misa. It must also be borne in mind that the army commanded by Tarik,  diminished as it must have been by the severe contest in the plains of Xerez, must have been insufficient   VOL. I. 4a",617,,

However this may be, Adh-dhobi and the writers consulted by Conde declare positively that  Murcia was taken by ’Abdu-l-’aziz, (not ’Abdu-l-’ala, as in the translation,) who, after making war on  Theodomir, concluded with him a treaty of peace in the month of Rejeb, a. x. ninety-four (4.p. April, 713).

Hence ‘Sierra  Morena,’ that chain of mountains which divides Andalusia from Castile, is a compound of two words, one  Arabic, Sierra (Sehrah), the other Latin, Morena (Mariana). In the present case the author ought to  have said, “to what was afterwards called the rock of Pelayo;” but it is seldom that the Arabian  writers trouble themselves about these niceties.   I have already observed that by ‘ Green Sea’ the geographers of that nation mean generally that part  of the ocean which washes the north-western shores of the Peninsula, at times the whole Bay of Biscay.  Treating of this sea, Ibnu Khaldin, in his historical Prolegomena, fo. 43, says that it was called  ‘Green Sea’ owing to the tinge of its waters. The remainder of it, towards the north, was called ‘Sea  of Darkness.’ If this account be true, it would prove a strong argument against the natives of the north-  western provinces of Spain, who believe their country never to have been subdued by the Moslems.    18 I have nowhere met with the name of this messenger, for Abii Nasr is what the Arabs call kunyah,  (in Spanish, alcurnia and alcufo,) an appellative. I suspect that Mugheyth and Abi Nasr are one and  the same person, as that general might well have received, on his return to the East, the honorific  surname of ‘ father of victory,’ which is the meaning of those words.   What mountain this is which Miisa is said to have crossed by a pass named after him, I have been  unable to ascertain. I believe the author means that Misa crossed the mountain by the pass of Tarik    (Buitrago). [sjle] ag) ymidl oi ye chs! pais See Note 55, p. 543,",618,,

The Lives of Abii Merwan ’ Abdu-l-malek Ibn Zohr, Abi Bekr Ibn Zohr, Ibn Bijeh, Abi-l-walid  Ibn Roshd, and Ibn Joljol ; translated from the work of Ibn Abi Ossayli’ah, No. 7340  in the British Museum.    Tbn Abi ’Ossaybi’ah and his work being sufficiently known to Oriental scholars through the extracts  published by De Sacy at the end of his Relution de I’ Egypte, par Abdallatif, Médecin Arabe de Baghdid,  Paris, 1810,! I shall only prefix here a few preliminary observations on the copy of that work preserved  in the library of the British Museum.   The MS., which once formed part of the Rich collection, is a quarto volume containing two hundred  and seven folios, written in a clear but rather small Eastern hand upon thin glazed paper. From a note  at the end of the volume it appears that the transcript was made at Isfahdn, and finished on Monday the  20th of Rejeb of the year one thousand and seventeen (Nov. a.p. 1608), by a certain Ibn Mohammed,  who was a Shiite,? not a follower of the sect of Sh4fe’i, as stated in the manuscript catalogue of the  Rich MSS.   The volume is written with tolerable correctness, and enriched with marginal notes, which add very  much to the value of the work. These are generally explanatory of the subjects treated, or refer to facts  which escaped the author’s attention, the copyist having in most instances given the sources whence he  derived his information, as the historical works of Abi-l-faraj, Al-makrizi, As-soyutti, and others.

There  is, however, a fact which Ibn Abi Ossayhi’ah himself states, and which has been overlooked by all the above-mentioned  writers; namely, that Ibn Abi Ossaybi’ah was a pupil of the celebrated Spanish physician and naturalist Abad Mohammed  ""Abdullah, surnamed Ibnu-l-beyttar, a native of Malaga, whom he knew at Cairo in six hundred and thirty-seven (a.

Physicians  studied medicine by his works, and there was no one in his time who could rival him in any of  the branches of that science.! Many anecdotes are related of him, and of his sagacity in  detecting diseases and applying the proper remedies,— qualities which none of the physicians  who preceded him ever possessed in a higher degree.   Abu Merwan entered the service of the Sultans called Al-mulaththamin (the wearers of  the veil), from whom he obtained at once honours, distinction, and great riches; he was in  their service when the Mahdi, who is the same person as Abt ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn  *Abdillah Ibn Tiimart,‘ entered Andalus in company with ’Abdu-l-mimen,’ and began to  spread his creed, and to level for himself the road to the empire, until, at last, his  words spread about, and his power was extended by the conquest of various countries and  the subjection of their inhabitants, who all came to swear obedience to him. The Madhi, in  fine, went on conquering and subduing until the supreme power fell into his hands, and he  became thus the ruler of an extensive and well-known empire.   However, when ’Abdu-l-miuimen had thus strengthened himself in power, and assumed the  title of Améru-l-mimenin (commander of the faithful), when he had taken possession of the  treasures of the West, he began to distribute them with the utmost prodigality, to show  justice, and to honour science, surrounding his court with the learned. One of those whom  he distinguished above the rest was Abi Merwén ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Zohr, whom he  appointed to be his chief physician, trusting his person entirely in his hands, and bestowing  on him honours and gifts even far beyond his expectations. Indeed Ibn Zohr was very much  esteemed by ’Abdu-l-muimen, with whom he always enjoyed great favour, being preferred by  him, and distinguished above all the other eminent men of his time. It was for the use of  this Sultén that Abi Merwén composed his celebrated antidote of the seventy simples  (Terydku-s-sabdyin{),° which he afterwards reduced to ten, and lastly to seven only, which last  _composition is known by the name of Terydku-l-antolah.’   “I was told (by Abd-l-késim Al-mu’éjeyni® Al-andalus‘) that upon a certain occasion the   Khalif ’Abdu-l-mimen was in want of a slight purgative, but being unwilling to take any of  the draughts used for that effect, he consulted Ibn Zohr on the subject. Ibn Zohr went to a vine         4 I read in the text yoy? Ydmart, but it is decidedly an error. However, I find the name of this conqueror    differently spelt in the various works consulted by me.

E  5 The author is mistaken. Abd ’Abdillah Ibn Témart, the founder of the religious sect and dynasty of the Almohades,  was never in Spain, but lived and died in Africa. It was not until the time of his successor, ’Abdu-l-mimen, that Spain was    subdued.

By that time  *Abdu-l-mimen was attacked by fever, and Ibn Zohr brought him a bunch of those grapes,  prescribing to him to eat of them. ’Abdu-l-mimen, who had the greatest confidence in his  physician, did not hesitate to eat of the grapes as he was told; Ibn Zohr then said to him,  “That is sufficient, O Commander of the Faithful! thou hast eaten ten grapes that will  “ purge thee so many times.”® He then told him of his contrivance, and ’Abdu-l-miimen,  finding the remedy as efficacious as Ibn Zohr had predicted to him,'° soon after recovered,—  a cure which very much increased the Khalif’s affection and regard for Ibn Zohr.   I was likewise told\by Muhiyyu-d-din Abt ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn ’Ali Ibn Mohammed  Ibnu-l~arabi At-tayi Al-hétemi, an inhabitant of Murcia,"" that as Abi Merwan ’Abdu-l-malck  Ibn Zohr was one day going from his house to the palace of the Commander of the Faithful  in Seville, he met on his way, close to the baths of Abi-l-kheyr, and not far from the house  of Ibn Maumel, a patient who was suffering from dropsy ;'* his belly was very much swollen,  his face had turned yellow, and he was in continual agony. Ibn Zohr asked him to take him  into his house, that he might examine him and see what was to be done. Having observed  attentively the symptoms of the disease, Ibn Zohr was going to give his opinion; when he  perceived over the bed and close to the patient’s head an old pitcher, out of which the sick  man generally drank his water. This Ibn Zohr desired to be brought down, and said to the  patient, “I must needs have that pitcher broken, that I may see what it contains.” When  the patient heard this, he exclaimed, “ By Allah! I have no other, but it shall be broken :”  he then ordered one of his servants to dash it against the wall, when, to the astonishment  of all the by-standers, a large toad was discovered lying at the bottom of it, having for a  considerable length of time lived and grown in the pitcher. Ibn Zohr then said to him,  “Thou art cured, O man! I need not prescribe for thee, thou hast been all this time  « drinking poisoned water.” The man, of course, recovered.   And I was told/by the Kadi Abii Merwin Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek  Al-lakhmi Al-baji '* the following anecdote; which he held from a trustworthy friend. There         > Untied!

BAS gs   13 The life of this individual, from whom Ibn Abi Ossaybi’ah seems to have derived most of his information respecting the  Beni Zohr, occurs in Al-makkarf (part 1. book vi. fo. 171) ; the author being there counted in the number of the illustrious  Andalusians who left their native country to travel in the East. His entire name was the Kadi Aba Merwin Mohammed  Ibn Ahmed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn Ahmed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Mohammed Ibn ‘Alf Ibn Shari’ah  Thu Refa’h Tbn Sakhar Ibn Semé4’h Al-lakhm{. He used the patronymic /ehdili and Al-baji; the former denoting that he  was a native or resident of Seville, the latter that he belonged to an illustrious family long domiciliated in Spain, and known  as the Beni Al-baji.

"    vi APPENDIX.    lived at Seville, in Ibn Zohr’s time, an eminent practitioner named Al-fér,'* who had written  a very excellent work, in two volumes, on the simples used as medicaments. Abt Merwan  Ibn Zohr was exceedingly fond of green figs, and used to eat immoderately of them; Al-far,  on the contrary, never ate any, or if he did it was only once a year: he used often to say to  Abii Merwdn Ibn Zohr, whenever he saw him eating that fruit, “if thou persist in eating  “ green figs thou wilt soon be attacked with a very bad na’lah,”'* a word meaning ‘an abscess’  in the language of the Western people. In reply to this, Abi Merwén used to say to him,  “if thou do not eat figs thou wilt be often subject to fever, and wilt at last die from  “a constipation in the bowels.”'® Ibn Zohr’s words were prophetic; Al-far died of the  disease which Ibn Zohr had announced to him. But the most extraordinary thing was that  Ibn Zohr himself died from an abscess in one of his sides. This is, no doubt, the mos  remarkable instance of prophetic sagacity ever known of two physicians.   They say that on the first appearance of the disease which caused his death, Ibn Zohr  began to take medicine, and apply plasters to it, but, seeing that the medicaments produced  no effect, and the disease did not abate, his son, Abi Bekr, said one day to him, “O father!  “if instead of such medicament thou wert to use so and so, and then add such a drug, and,  “ mixing it, thou didst prepare such a medicament, thou mightst, perhaps, recover ;” and Ibn  Zohr answered him, “O my son! if God has decreed that what is manifest should be altered,  “ T need not prepare medicines, since whatever remedies I may employ, ne decrees must be  “ fulfilled, and his will finally executed.”   Among the disciples of Abii Merwan ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Abj-l~ala Ibn Zohr in the practice  of medicine, the most eminent was Abi-l-huseyn Ibn Asdiin,” better known by the name of  Al-masdim,'* and Abu Bekr, son of the celebrated theologian and Kadi Abi-l-hasan, who         called also the Beni Al-baji, to whom belonged the celebrated writer and theologian, Abi-l-walid Al-baji, for these were  originally from Bijah (Beja), a town of Africa, not far from Cairwan, while the former took their patronymic from a town of  a similar name in the west of Spain. .   Abad Merwan left Spain for Syria, and landed at ’Akka (St. John of Acre) on the sixth day of Ramadhén, a. H. six  hundred and thirty-four (3rd May, a.v. 1237), taking up his abode at the college of ’A’del. He then made his pilgrimage  to Mekka, and settled on his return at Cairo, where he met with Ibn Abi Ossaybi’ah. Although not a physician himself, Abi  Merwan must have known many particulars respecting the family of the Beni Zohr, some members of which he must have  known in his youth; and on this account the information which he communicated to thcir biographer is exceedingly  valuable. Abd Merwén died in six hundred and thirty-five (a. p. 1237-8), on his return from his second pilgrimage.    eb    5 Gdej This must be one of the many words introduced by the western Arabs.

Abd Merwén Ibn Abi-lala Ibn Zohr wrote,—1.

Ibn Zohr wrote this work for his son, who  was then very young, and about to undertake his first tour through the country, releasing his  father from the fatigues of his profession.—1v.

Ar. Hisp, Esc. vol. ii. p. 132, c. 2.

This is the same work which Doctor  Paravici, assisted by a Jewish physician named Jacob, translated into Latin (a.p. 1281) from an intermediate Hebrew version,  for the use of John Dandolo, Doge of Venice. It was first printed in that city by the brothers Joannes and Gregorius  de Forlivio in 1490, in folio, under the following title, Lider Theierifi dahalmodana vahaltadabar, cujus est interpretatio  rectificatio medicationis et regiminis: editus in arabico a perfecto viro Abumaruan Avenzohar, et translatus de hebraico  tn latinum Venetiis a magistro Paravicio, ipso sibi vulgarizante, magistro Jacobo Hebreo, Anno Domini Jesu Xti. 1281. In  the subsequent editions the title of the work is more correctly printed Theyzir, but the author's name is variously dis-  figured “ Abimeron Abynzoahar, Abhymeron Abinzohar, and Abynmeron Abygohar.” It was reprinted in 1496 and 1497,  with the colliget of Averroes; and there are, besides, several other editions of the sixteenth century: Lugd.

Abd Bekr Ibn Zohr Al-hafid,! or the celebrated and illustrious Sheikh, physician, and  Wizir, Abi Bekr Mohammed Ibn Abi Merwén Ibn Abi-l’ala Ibn Zohr.| He was born and         * educated at Seville under the eye of his father, from whom he learnt medicine and other    sciences, which he considerably contributed to advance by his works. He was a middle-  : Sized man, well made, muscular, and strong, and had a clear complexion ;} he lived to a great  age;-preserving, to the very last, his strong frame and firm step, although some time before  his death he became deaf. 'He was deeply versed in traditions, and knew the Korn by  Theart: he also gave his attention to the study of literature and the Arabic language, and  / so great were his attainments in this branch that there was scarcely a man in his days  _ who could compete with him in the knowledge of his own language, and people used to  : say of him that he had reached perfection both in medicine and in literature. He likewise  ' studied poetry, and excelled in it, as can easily be proved by some of his muwashshahdt?  which are sufficiently known, and are remarkable, above all things, for the beauty of the  conceptions, than which none finer ever entered the mind of a poet. To the above-  mentioned accomplishments Abi Bekr Ibn Zohr united that of being very strict in the  fulfilment of his religious duties, sound in his doctrines, magnanimous in his actions, and  a lover of virtue; he had likewise the gift of eloquence, and could speak very fluently. As  long as he lived he knew of no rival in the science of medicine ; he became known, and his  fame spread, all over Andalus, and even out of that country.   I was told by the Kédi Abi Merwén Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek AlI-bAji,  an inhabitant of Seville, what follows. “I was told by the Sheikh, physician, and Wizir, Abi  “ Bekr Ibn Zohr, that, when young, he took lessons and worked for seven years with my  “ grandfather, ’Abdu-l-malek Al-béji, reading with him the book entitled Al-madiénah,  “treating of the sect of Malik Ibn Ans, the composition of Sahnun, and that he likewise  “ read with him the book entitled Musnad, by Ibn Abi Sheybah.”   I was also told by the same person (Abi Merwaén Al-béji), who held it from Abi Bekr Ibn  Zohr himself, that he was exceedingly muscular and strong, so much so that Ihe could draw a  bow weighing one hundred and fifty Sevillean pounds, which have sixteen ounces, and  each ounce ten drachms ; that he could play very well at the game of chess; and, lastly, that  there was no physician in his days who could equal him in the knowledge and practice of his  art ; that he was the servant of two different dynasties, having first, together with his father,  served the Almoravide Sultans towards the end of their empire, and having afterwards entered  that of the Almohades, or the sons of ’Abdu-l-miimen, as they are otherwise called. His  father having died in ’Abdu-l-mtimen’s lifetime, Abi Bekr succeeded him in his appointment,         u oss! He was called Al-hafid, to distinguish him from his great grandfather, who bore the same name and  surname. See Note 36, p. 337, where the word Al-hafid has been printed Al-Aafidh by mistake.   2 On the meaning of this word see Note 19, p. 367.   3 See p. 213. This work was much used in Spain by law students.",630,,
"    APPENDIX. ix    and after the demise of that Sultan passed into the service of his son, Abii Ya’ktb Yusuf,  and then into that of his grandson, Abi Yusuf Ya’kub, surnamed Al-manstr. After the  death of the latter Ibn Zohr entered the household of his son, ""Abdullah Mohammed An-  nassir, but he did not serve him long, for he died soon after.   The death of Abi Bekr Ibn Zohr (whom may God forgive!) took place in the year five  hundred and ninety-six at Morocco, whither he [the Sultén?] had gone on a visit. He was  buried at the spot called “ the cemeteries of the Sheikhs.” Abd Bekr Ibn Zohr was nearly  ninety years old when he died.‘   The same author says “ Abii Bekr Ibn Zohr was extremely sagacious in the discovery of  “ diseases, cautious and expert in the application of medicine, an excellent regulator of  “ health,—qualities which he evinced when still young: for instance, one day his father Abii  “ Merwan Ibn Zohr happened to write a prescription for the Khalif ’Abdu-l-mimen for a  “ purgative which he stood in need of; his son, Abii Bekr, having by chance perused it, said,  “¢This simple must be replaced by another, as this remedy would not suit *Abdu-l-mimen’s  “ constitution.’ This remark having been communicated to his father, he said, ‘O Com-  “ mander of the Faithful! Abu Bekr is right;? upon which he effaced from his prescription  “ the name of the simple objected to by his son, and the medicine, when prepared agreeably    “to Abu Bekr’s instructions, proved most beneficial to the Khalif. Abdi Bekr Ibn Zohr .    “composed the Terydku-l-khamseyni (the antidote of the fifty simples), for the use of Abi  “ Yusuf Ya’kib Al-manstr.” .   The author continues. “ And I was told by a trustworthy friend that Abi Bekr Ibn Zohr  “had an intimate friend belonging to the tribe of Al-yandki,’ in whose company he used  “to sit for many an hour playing at chess. This man was one day at Abi Bekr’s  “house playing a game with him, when Abt Bekr, observing that his friend was rather  “ thoughtful, and not in his usual good humour, said to him, ‘ What is the matter with thee?  “ Thou lookest anxious and distressed, as if something was preying on thy mind; let us hear  “the cause.’ ‘Willingly,’ answered this friend. ‘I have a daughter who has been wedded  “to a youth, who is shortly coming to fetch her; I want three hundred din4rs for her  “ marriage portion.’ ‘ Very well,’ replied Abi Bekr, ‘go on playing and never mind that, for  “T have with me three hundred dinérs all but five, and they are at thy service.’ The friend  “ went on playing for a while, and when, after some time, he begged leave to retire, Abi Bekr  “ gave him the sum as agreed. Shortly after, however, he returned, bringing back the three  “hundred dinérs all but five, which he gave to Abi Bekr. ‘ What is the meaning of this?  “ said the latter to him. ‘I have sold an olive plantation of mine for seven hundred dinérs,  “and I now come to pay thee the sum which thou wast generous enough to lend me, as I  “have still four hundred remaining.’ Ibn Zohr then said to his friend, ‘ Keep that sum and  “ spend it for thy use; for when I gave it thee I never intended to have it back again: keep         ‘4 The author of the Karttdés, who refers the death of Abi Bekr Ibn Zohr to the twenty-first day of Dhi-l-hajjah, a. H.  five hundred and ninety-six (2nd October, a.p. 1200), says that he was ninety-four years old when he died.    5 Lint pi p+  VOL. I. 6",631,,

When he first thought of this he commissioned Abi Bekr Ibn Zohr Al-hafid  “to this effect, and intrusted him with the execution of his orders, for, although he well  “knew that Ibn Zohr himself was seriously devoted to the study of logic and philosophy,  “ and had in his library many works on those sciences, yet he feigned not to be aware of it,  “ not choosing to prosecute him on account of it. Abid Bekr, however, executed faithfully  “ the task intrusted to his care; he searched the booksellers’ shops all over Seville, taking  “ care that there should not remain one single work treating on the above subjects, to the  “ great mortification of the lovers of those sciences. There happened to be at Seville a man  “ of rank who hated Ibn Zohr, whose favour at court he envied. This man, who had much  “malice in him, drew up an accusation, purporting that he was certain that Ibn Zohr,  “ notwithstanding the Khalif’s injunctions to the contrary, persisted in giving his attention  “to the study of the prohibited works, a large number of which he was known actually to  “ possess. This declaration, confirmed by several witnesses, who signed their names to it,  “was then sent for the perusal of Al-mansiir to Hisnu-l-faraj, a castle not far from Seville,  “where that Khalif was then residing. Hisnu-l-faraj7 was a fortress built by Al-mansiur,  “ two miles from Seville, on a spot where the air is so salubrious that wheat is stored and  “ kept for a space of eighty years without being spoilt: it was Abi Bekr who selected the  “ spot, recommending Al-mansir to build on it, and retire thither in certain seasons of the  “ year. However, while Al-manstr was staying with his court at this place the written accu-  “ sation was brought to him. Having perused it, he instantly ordered the author of it to be  “ seized and cast into prison, which was done: all the witnesses who had signed it then took  “ the alarm and fled. On this occasion Al-mansir is said to have exclaimed,—‘ By Allah!         U Gb! ro is logic, sometimes dialectics.   7 It is now called San Juan de Alfarache, from a church consecrated to St. John, built on the site of the old mosque. In  the division of the lands about Seville, made after the conquest of that city by St. Ferdinand, this village was still called  Hesnalfarache. See Repartimiento de Sevilla, Bib. Egerton, in the Brit. Mus., No. 478.",632,,
"    APPENDIX. xi    “ when I intrusted Ibn Zohr with this commission I did it in order that people should not  “ speak of him and accuse him; and, by Allah! were all my subjects to sign this declaration,  “and bear witness that Abi Bekr Ibn Zohr does what he is accused of in this paper, I  “ would still say that it was not true, so well do I know Ibn Zohr’s soundness of mind and  “ strict religious principles.’ ”   The following anecdote I hold from Abi-l-’abbés Ahmed Ibn Mohammed Ibn Ahmed of  Seville. “Ibn Zohr had two pupils to whom he used to teach medicine; they went to and  “ from his house, receiving his lessons for some length of time, and reading before him works  “on that science. One day, as the students came up to him at the usual hour, Ibn Zohr,  “who was then engaged in conversation with Abi-l-huseyn, better known under the by-  “ name of Al-masdiim, observed in‘the hands of one of them a small book, treating of logic,  “ which they, no doubt, meant to study. No sooner did Ibn Zohr cast his eyes on the book  “ than he exclaimed, ‘What is that ? and, taking the book from the student’s hands, began to  “ peruse it. Finding that the book treated on the prohibited science, Ibn Zohr first threw  “the volume into a corner of the apartment, and then went up to the delinquents, intending  “to beat them. The students fled, but Ibn Zohr, without stopping to put on his shoes,  “ followed them into the street, they running as fast as they could, he following them, until,  “ seeing he could not overtake them, and that he had gone to a considerable distance from  “his house, he left off the pursuit and returned. The students, dreading his anger, were  “some days without coming to Ibn Zohr for their lessons; but at last they took courage and  “ presented themselves to him, apologizing for having brought to his house the obnoxious  “ book, which, they said, did not belong to them, nor had they ever entertained the least  “ idea of reading its contents, but that, as they were coming to him that day, they happened  “to see it on their way in the hands of a story-teller,*—that a broil ensued among the  “ audience,—and they, profiting by it, rushed among the crowd and possessed themselves by  “ force of the book in question, which they had brought to his house, ignorant of its contents.  “Ibn Zohr feigned to admit their excuse, and proceeded to give them lectures on medicine  “as usual, with this difference, that after some time spent in that occupation, Ibn Zohr  “ generally bade them repeat a part of the Koran, enjoining them to read when at home  “ commentaries upon that divine work, as well as traditional stories respecting the Prophet,  “and other works on theological subjects, but, above all things, to be very strict in the  “ fulfilment of their religious duties, and not to forget any of the instructions he had given  “them. The youths complied with their master’s instructions, and when, some time after-  “ wards, Ibn Zohr perceived that their minds were properly trained, he one day brought out  “to them a copy of the very work on logic which he saw in their hands, saying, ‘ Now that  “ you are prepared for the perusal of that work I have no objection to read it with you,’  “and he immediately began to expound it to them, which filled the youths with amaze-  “ment.” I have mentioned this anecdote in order to show the soundness of Ibn Zohr’s  mind, and the strictness of his religious principles.         * EE ake HOST yw Nghe 9 mole bys adl yy rol pry Gell § woe ex Hy)    admits, F believe, of no other translation.",633,,
"    xii APPENDIX.    I was told by the Kadi Abi Merwan Al-baji—“ Abi Zeyd ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Bujin,?  “who was Wizir of Al-manstr, had conceived an enmity towards Abi Bekr Ibn Zohr  “ Al-hafid, whom he envied and hated on account of the great favour he enjoyed with  ‘ Al-mansir, and the great regard which that Sultan entertained for him on account of his  “earning. Not knowing how to hurt him he decided upon administering poison to him, and  “ this he effected by bribing a man who lived with Ibn Zohr, and who gave it him in an egg.  “ There lived also with Ibn Zohr a sister of his, who, together with her daughter, was well  “ practised in medicine and pharmacy, and very expert in curing the diseases peculiar to their  “ sex, owing to which they had admittance into the harem of Al-mansir, so that no child of  * that monarch, or of his relations, ever was born within its walls that did not come through  “ the hands of Ibn Zohr’s sister, or, after her death, of her daughter. This sister was present  “ when Ibn Zohr ate the egg, and she also tasted it, when all their science combined did not  “ save them from its effects.| Abi Zeyd ’Abdu-r-rahmaén Ibn Bijan died a violent death,    “© having been killed by one of his kinsmen.”    Among the best disciples of Abii Bekr Al-hafid is counted Abi Ja’far Ibnu-l-ghazzél.  (Here follow several quotations from Ibn Zohr’s poems which I have not translated. ]    ‘    III. Ibn Badjeh (vulgo Avempace), fo. 142.

Ibn Bajeh was also versed in literature and in the Arabic language; he knew  the Korén by heart, and was one of the most eminent physicians that ever lived.

"    APPENDIX. xili    Abi-I-hasan ’Ali Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz Ibnu-l-imaém, in the preface to his work entitled “a col-  lection of the sayings* of Abi Bekr Mohammed Ibnu-s-séyegh Ibn Bajeh,” expresses himself  as follows: “ The present is a collection of all the sayings of Abi Bekr (may God show him  “ mercy!) on the philosophical sciences, since such were his witticism and the elegance of his  “expressions on those abstruse and subtle topics that he was reckoned, while he lived, the  “ wonder of his age, and the phenomenon of the world. Works on philosophical topics were  “ then very common in Andalus since the days of the Sultan Al-hakem,‘ who caused them to  “be bought for him in the East, together with other curious and valuable works, and to be  “brought to his dominions, where they soon spread among the studious. Al-hakem was,  “indeed, the first sovereign who caused the works of the ancient philosophers to be  introduced into Andalus, (may God remunerate him amply for it!) for, before his time, no  “book of this kind ever gladdened the eyes of the studious, and if it did, it was to lead  “them astray, and to guide them into error, as happened in the case of Ibn Hazm, of  “ Seville.   “Tbn Bajeh,” continues Ibnu-l-imém, “was the man of his time who worked most  “ seriously and with the greatest attention at this sort of studies, surpassing all his pre-  “ decessors, as well as Ibn Hazm, in the soundness of all his propositions, extensive reading,  “and clearness of judgment. The paths of knowledge in the aforesaid sciences became thus  “ ornamented by this master (Ibn Bajeh), and by another doctor, named Mélik Ibn Wahib,' a  “ native of Seville, and a contemporary of Ibn Bajeh, who contributed likewise greatly to the  * “advancement of science, only that he (Ibn Wahib) taught little else than the first elements  “of psychology.6 After this, Ibn Wahib began to abstain from the study of philosophy, as  “well as from public conversation on the subject, owing to the great dangers which sur-  “rounded him and all those who followed those pursuits, and the risk of losing his life on  “account of it, for so. elevated was the view which he took of the said sciences that he  “would, no doubt, have rendered himself obnoxious had he persevered in the study of  “them. He therefore now gave all his attention to the lawful’ sciences, in which he soon  “became the prince, or nearly so; although, owing to the reasons above specified, the light  “ of philosophy did not shine upon his writings, neither was there found in them, as in the  “ works of others, any thing hidden to be explained after his death.   “ But to return to Abi Bekr. His natural inclination having early carried him away into  “the above difficult paths, he never ceased working with the greatest assiduity, travelling in         ©   3 The word Ju! 55! a plural of J has often the meaning of ‘ speech, discourse, essay.’   4 Al-hakem II., surnamed 4l-mustanser-billah, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmén III., occupied the throne of Cordova from a. 4.  350 to 366.   © Conde (Hist. de la Dom. vol. ii. p. 216) mentions a distinguished theologian, named Abu Abdala Melik ben Wahil, who  was living in a.. 514.

Ibn Bajeh consecrated, likewise,  “ his time to geometry and astronomy, leaving behind him works which sufficiently testify his  “ proficiency in those sciences. Respecting metaphysics, if truth be said, Ibn Bajeh did not  “ establish any new doctrine, nor is there any thing remarkable in his writings if we except a  “ few loose observations in that epistle of his entitled Al-wadd’, and in his essay ‘on human  “reason, besides a few separate hints in two more of his philosophical tracts. Yet these are  “ exceedingly vigorous, and go very far to prove his proficiency in that illustrious science  “ (metaphysics) which is the complement and the end of every other science. It was to his  “ constant application to the above studies that Ibn Bajeh owed all his attainments and his  “ superiority in all the other branches of knowledge. But what will appear almost incredible  “is that Ibn Bajeh should have strained every nerve to become possessed of those sciences  “ which had been known and cultivated before him, and in which the paths of invention were  “ entirely closed’ to him, and that he should have fallen short in his endeavours to ameliorate  “ that science which is the complement of every science, and an object of desire to all those  “ endowed with a brilliant disposition, or to whom God imparted his divine gifts. How-  “ ever, with all this, Ibn Bajeh was, of all his contemporaries, the most successful in pro-  “ moting the study of metaphysics, redeeming it from the shadows which enveloped it, and  “ bringing it to light, (may God show him mercy!)

Of this, however, there can be no doubt,'? namely, that the two above-  “ mentioned philosophers were, together with Ibn Bajeh, those who united in themselves all  “the learning and all the talents of their predecessors, distinguishing themselves by the  “ clearness of their dissertations, and competing in their works with the most celebrated  “ philosophers of antiquity.”   This Abu-l-hasan ’Ali Ibnu-l-imém was from Granada. He was an eminent writer, well  versed in various sciences, and lived in great intimacy with Ibn Bajeh, whose friend and  disciple he was. Abi-l-hasan travelled to the East, and died at Kuss.   Among the pupils of Ibn Bajeh the most celebrated was the Kadi Abi-l-walid Mohammed  Ibn Roshd. Ibn Bajeh died young, at the city of Faris, where he was buried. I was told by  the Kadi Abi Merwén Al-ishbili that he saw there his tomb, and close to it that of the  theologian Abi Bekr Ibnu-l-’arabi, known as the author of various works.   Among the remarkable sayings attributed to Ibn Bajeh the following is one. “ There are  “ things the knowledge of which is beneficial to man even long after he has learnt them—  “ namely, good actions, because they ensure him the rewards of Almighty God.”   Ibn Bajeh wrote the following works:—1.

Abu-l-walid Ibn Roshd,' that is, the Kadi Abi-l-walid Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibn  Mohammed Ibn Roshd, was a native of Cordova, where he passed the first years of his life.  He became eminent for his brilliant qualities, and distinguished for his ardour in the acquisi-  tion of learning. He attained the utmost limit of perfection in jurisprudence and in the  science of controversy, which he learnt from the Faquih and Hafedh Abi Mohammed Ibn  Razek. He was likewise greatly versed in medicine, and left behind him several excellent  works remarkable for their contents; such as the Kitdbu-l-kulliyydt (the book of the  whole),? in the composition of which he surpassed himself. Abu-l-walid had contracted an  intimate friendship with Abi Merwén Ibn Zohr, so that when he wrote the above work ‘on  the whole,’ he desired his friend to write another ‘on the parts,* that might be a sort of  complement to his, and form a complete treatise on the science of medicine.‘   I was told by the Kédi Abit Merwén Al-béji that the Kédi Abu-l-walid Ibn Roshd was  endowed with a powerful reason, a clear understanding, and an acute mind.’ He learnt         = gs IS bey gre is ge Sy Hegel nail oe Gel is  * ook pe le tl 5 pbs    Besides the works here enumerated, there are in the Escurial Library (Bid.

They are all written in the same hand, and, if we are to believe  Casiri, by Ton Bajeh himself, in a. a. five hundred and twelve. But if such be the case there must be some mistake in the  date, for Ibn Bajeh having died in a. a. five hundred and thirty-three, or, according to other authorities, in five hundred and  twenty-five, at the age, we are assured, of twenty-three, the book could not be written by him in five hundred and twelve,  when he was, if we take the former date, ten, if the latter, only two years old.

When he appeared before him the Sultén  “ honoured him greatly, and made him come close to him, going even so far as to allot him  “for his seat the cushion where Abi Mohammed ’Abdu-l-waéhed,’ son of the Sheikh Abi  “ Hafs Al-hentéti,? the companion and friend of ’Abdu-l-mimen, and the third or fourth in  “rank among the Sheikhs composing the council.of the Almohades, usually sat. This Abi  “ Mohammed ’Abdu-l-wéhed was a great favourite with Al-mansir, who had given him in  “ marriage one of his daughters, by whom he had a son called ’Ali, who is at this moment the  “ ruler of Eastern Africa.? However, when Al-mansiir had thus placed Abi-l-walid close to  “his person, and made him sit by his side, he began to converse at length with him upon  “ different topics. After this Abi-l-walid went out of the royal presence, seeing which the  “ whole of the ¢albes who had been present at the interview, and those among his friends  “who had been waiting for him outside of the palace, congratulated him upon the high         res  6 This is Aba Ja’far Ibn Hérin le poe At-turj4li, whose life is also in Ibn Abf Ossaybi’ah, loco laudato, fo. 148.    He was a native of Turjélah or Turricella (now Truxillo), a town which, the author observes, “ was entirely peopled by  “ Moslems, by order of Al-mansir (Aba ’A’mir), who found it deserted in one of his incursions.”    7 Abi Mohammed ’Abdu-l-wahed _¢ pol Al-hadhri was one of the ten (others say eight) Sheikhs who at first com-    posed the council of the Almohades, and who assisted the Mahdi in the propagation, by the sword, of his religious tenets.  (See Moura’s Karttds, and Conde, Hist. de la Dom. vol. ii. p. 220.) He was the progenitor of a dynasty called by the  African historians the Beni Abi Hafs. See ibid., and Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 225.    ® The MS. reads AP Gad! which is undoubtedly a mistake.    * I can nowhere find an account of this prince. Both Ibnu Khaldin (Ar. MS. in the Brit. Mus., No. 9575, fo. 126, verso)  and Ibnu-]-khattib (apud Casiri, Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 225, et seg.), who give the history of the African dynasty called  the Benf Abf Hafs, say nothing of o Sultén of Ténis called ’Alf. What follows is a translation from the former of those writers.  “ ’Abdu-l-waéhed Ibn Ab{f Hafs was appointed governor of the province of Tunis or Eastern Africa in 603 of the Hijra.  “ After his death, which took place in 618, his son, Aba Zeyd ’Abdu-r-rahman, was raised by the people to that dignity,  “ but Al-mustanser, Sultan of the Almohades, whose vassal he was, not approving of his election, he was removed after  “an administration of three months, and the government transferred to his cousin, Ibrahim Ibn Isma’fl Ibn Abi Mohammed.  “ After the removal of the latter, in 620, the government of Eastern Africa was conferred upon Abi Mohammed ’Abdullah,  “son of Abi Mohammed Ibn Hafs, who held it until 625, when, profiting by the troubles which attended the reigns of  “the last sovereigns of the family of ’Abdu-l-mumen, he made himself independent in his government. He was succeeded  “ by his brother, Aba Zakariyy4, who reigned until 647, the period of his death, when the throne devolved upon his son, Aba  “ Abdillah.””   ’Abdu-l-wéhed, therefore, had no other sons than 'Abdu-r-rahmAn, ’Abdullah, and Abi Zakariyy4: if, besides, we bear in  mind that Ibn Abf Ossaybi'ah quotes Abi Merwén Al-bajf in this passage, the error becomes manifest, since that writer,  having died in 637, could have known only the first three princes of that dynasty. I have, nevertheless, left it as in the  text.",640,,
"    APPENDIX. xix    “ place which he occupied in the good graces of his sovereign, and the great distinction with  “which he had been treated. But Abu-l-walid said to them,—‘ I do not see why you should  “ congratulate me, for if the prince of the believers has bestowed his favours upon me in  “ this manner, he has merely made me advance one step towards what I expect of him, and  “ strengthened the hopes'I have founded on him.’   “The rivals and enemies of Ibn Roshd, on hearing of his being called to the presence of  “ Al-manstr, had given out that the prince of the believers had called him to have him  “ executed; so that when Ibn Roshd came out,of the palace safe, he ordered one of his  “servants to go to his house and tell his family to dress him a kattd'® and some young  “ pigeons, and to have them ready when he should return, meaning to invite his enemies to  “ partake of his repast, and thus to win over their hearts by his forgiveness.   “ Some time after this adventure Al-manstr was really displeased with Abu-l-walid Ibn  “ Roshd, whom he caused to be exiled to Al-isalah,"" a town close to Cordova, formerly  “inhabited by Jews, enjoining him not to move from it without his order. Al-mansir  “ punished at the same time several other distinguished and learned men, confining them,  “ likewise, to different parts of his dominions; the apparent cause of his displeasure being  “that they had been accused of giving their leisure hours to the cultivation of philosophy  “and the studies of the ancients. Besides Abu-l-walid Ibn Roshd, the sufferers on this  “ occasion were Abi Ja’far Adh-dhahebi,” the theologian; Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn  “Ibréhim, Kadi of Bejéyah;'* Abd-r-rabi’ Al-kefif, Abu-l~abbas Al-hafedh, and the poet  “ Al-karébi;' all of whom passed some time in exile. After this, Al-mansir having been         10 Ad-demiri (Arab. MS. in my possession) gives the following description of this bird. Kattd, #65 which forms its plural  in kattawét and kattaydt, and the noun of unity éatfdtun, is the name for a bird so called by the Arabs because its cry  resembles the noise produced by that word thus, kattd, katté! It is of two kinds, one called dodri, the other jini. The  kodri is of a dusty colour, and has the body covered with black and white spots, except the tail, which is of a yellowish hue,  and short. The jrini has the stomach, the wings, and feet, black, the rest of the body is grey spotted with bright yellow.  This latter kind is larger than the sodri, the proportion being this, that a juni is generally equal in size and weight to two  kodris. The juni, however, is inferior in voice to the kodri, since it utters a confused and disagreeable sound from the  throat, like that of a man who is gargling ; while the Aodré, on the contrary, utters a distinct and intelligible sound. It is  owing to this circumstance that this kind of kattd is called juni. The females lay their eggs one by one, sometimes they  lay two, but three at most; this being the reason why pocts have called the bird ummu-L-thaldth (the mother of the three).  Jeuharf adds a third species, which he calls Aat¢é¢.—The habits of this bird are these: when it wants to drink it rises before  day-break from its nest, and flies towards the rising sun a distance of seven days’ march, then it comes down suddenly upon  the water, and takes a nah/a,—a word meaning ‘the first draught of a camel or of a sheep.’ When it has thus quenched  its thirst, it remains for two or three hours in the neighbourhood of the water, flying about, when it returns to drink  a second time. Such, at least, is the account given by Al-w&bed{ in his commentary upon the poems of Abi-t-tayyeb  Al-mutennabi.    - 5   "" AJL!   2 The life of this individual, who was also an eminent physician, is to be found in Ibn Abf Ossaybi’ah, loco laudato, fo. 148,  verso, His entire name was Abia Ja’far Ahmed Ibn Pam (Jorj?) Adh-dhahebi. He was a physician to Al-mansir (Aba  Ya’kdb), and to his son, An-nfssir. He died at Telemsdn in a. u. 600.    a bls? This might be intended for Bejénah.

He used to  “say of him,—* Abi Ja’far Adh-dhahebj is like the purest dhaheb (gold), which, instead  “ of losing, gains in quality in the melting pan.’?” The Kédi Abi Merwén further says,  “ And to prove the great affection and esteem which Al-manstr entertained for Abu-l-walid  “Ibn Roshd, it is only requisite to say that whenever the former summoned him to his  “ presence for the purpose of conversing with him, or inquiring into some particulars about  “the sciences which ’Abu-l-walid cultivated, he always used to give him the affectionate  “ term of brother.” The same writer states that “Ibn Roshd having once composed a work  “ on zoology, in which he described every species of animals, giving the habits and pecu-  “ liarities of each, said, in treating about the giraffe, ‘1 have seen a quadruped of this sort at  “the King of the Berbers,’ thereby meaning Al-mansiir, and that when the passage was  “ reported to that monarch he considered the expression ‘King of the Berbers’ as an  “ outrage, and was highly incensed on account of it. It is further said that this was the  “ principal cause which brought on Al-mansir’s displeasure, and his order for Ab-l-walid’s  “ exile; and they relate that the excuse given by Ibn Roshd was that it was a slip of the  “pen, and that he had meant to write Médlek al-barreyn""® (the king of the two countries),  “ meaning thereby Africa and Andalus.”   The Kédi Abi-l-walfd Ibn Roshd (whom may God forgive!) died at Morocco at the  beginning of the five hundred and ninety-fifth year of the Hijra, and the first of the reign  of An-n4ssir. Abi-l-walid lived to a very great age, and left a son named Abi Mohammed  *Abdullah, also a physician, and who was much versed in the practical part of medicine.  Abi-l-walid left also other sons, who applied themselves to the study of theology and the  law, and became Kadis of towns and districts. Of the remarkable sayings attributed to Ibn  Roshd the following is one. ‘“ Whoever studies anatomy, his merits with the Almighty are  “ increased by it.”   The following are the works written by Abi-l-walid Ibn Roshd :—1. Kitdbu-l-tahssil, or an  exposition of the various opinions entertained by the companions of the Prophet, the tabi’s  and the second tabi’s, as well as of the arguments advanced in favour of or against their  respective sects or schools, and a declaration of the principal passages, forming, as it were,  the cream of contradictory opinions.7—11.

He also paid great attention to the analysis of simples, and the discovery of their several  properties. He wrote a commentary on the books of Dioscorides Anazarbeus,? wherein  he described every one of the simples of which the Greek physician had given the names,  explaining at the same time, with much clearness and precision, their qualities and their use  as medicaments, tearing the veil and dissipating the obscurity in which most of them were  formerly enveloped. In the preface to his work, Ibn Joljol says as follows :   “The books of Dioscorides were first. translated from the Greek into Arabic by Estefan,  “son of Basil’ the interpreter, who completed his task at Baghddd during the reign of  “the Abbasi Khalif Ja’far Al-mutewakkel.‘ Honeyn, son of Is’hak,’ then corrected the  “ version made by Estefan, and purged it from the errors it contained. Having afterwards  “ substituted Arabic for such of the Greek names as had been suffered to remain for  “ want of the translator knowing their equivalent in Arabic, he gave his work to the public.  “ Such names of simples, however, as Honeyn found without an equivalent in Arabic he left in  “ the Greek language, trusting that God would send after him people acquainted with their  “ properties, and who would give them names, since it is an ascertained fact that simples  “receive only their nomenclature either through the common consent of the people of a  “ country, who have observed their properties and the effects they produce, or by derivation,  “ or otherwise, but always by a sort of mutual consent. Estefan,® therefore, trusted that  “there would come after him other naturalists, who, being acquainted with the properties of  « medicaments, the names of which in Arabic were unknown in his time, would denominate  “them according to the custom of their days, and that by these means what was before  “ unknown would become known.   “This version of Estefan,” continues Ibn Joljol, “such as it was, with some of the  “ simples having equivalent names in Arabic and others not, was brought to Andalus; the  “learned of this country, as well as those of the East, studying by it until the reign of  “?Abdu-r-rahmén An-ndssir, son of Mohammed, Sultén of Andalus, when an ambassador  “from Arménius,’? Emperor of Constantinople, came to Cordova with letters and pre-  “sents from his master. This event took place, if I am not mistaken, in the year three  “hundred and thirty-seven of the Hijra (a.p. 948-9). There was, among other valuable  “ things sent by Armanius, a copy of Dioscorides’ work, beautifully written in the old Greek  “language, the same that the ancient Ionians wrote and spoke, and having besides drawings  “ of plants beautifully executed and illuminated with the most vivid colours.

"    APPENDIX. XXV    “ Constantinople sent at the same time a copy of the work of the historian Orosius,’ an  “excellent history of the Romans, in which were described the events of ancient times  “ and the actions of former kings, and many other curious and important events. In a letter  “ accompanying the presents, the Emperor Armanius, alluding to this copy of Dioscorides,  “ observed to An-néssir, ‘the books of Dioscorides ought to be translated into Arabic by a  “ man well versed in the Greek language, and acquainted also with the properties of simples ;  “without this requisite the merits of this wonderful composition will never be duly  “ appreciated and brought to light.’ He added, ‘ Unless thou find, O king! in thy states a  “ man properly qualified to undertake this version, the advantages and merits of these books  “ will for ever remain in obscurity. As to the books of Orosius, being written in Latin, I  “have no doubt but that thou wilt find in thy states a man who can read that language,  “ and translate the work into Arabic for thy own use.’9   “ It happened, however,” continues Ibn Joljol, “ that there was no Christian among those  “ who resided in Cordova at the time who could read and understand the language of the  “ ancient Greeks, so that the work of Dioscorides remained untranslated in An-néssir’s library.  “ In the meanwhile the learned of this country made use of Estefan’s translation, which, as I  “have remarked elsewhere, was brought from Baghdéd. At last, when An-néssir, some  “ years after this event, returned the embassy of Arménius, he desired that monarch to send  « him a man well learned in the language and literature of the ancient Greeks, who should  “teach them in Cordova to some of An-nassir’s slaves, and thereby enable them to make a  “ suitable Arabic version. This request was readily granted by Arménius, who dispatched to  “ Cordova a monk named Nicolaus,’® who arrived in Cordova in the year three hundred and  “ forty of the Hijra (a.p. 951-2). There were at that time in the capital several eminent  “ physicians, men of the greatest learning, who burned with desire to acquire a perfect  “knowledge of the books of Dioscorides, and dive into the sense of the passages that  “ remained still obscure and unexplained in the translation, as well as to find the equivalent  “names of the plants in Arabic. Among those who most eagerly desired an opportunity  “ to gain a sight of that precious work, and who, owing to the esteem in which they were held  “by the Khalif, could at any time go to the palace and enter the library, was Hasdéy Ibn  “ Bashrit,'' the Israelite. With this man the monk Nicolaus formed an intimate acquaintance,         & Goats] Gre le Carus pr  % The history of Orosius was certainly translated into Arabic.

Hasdéy was likewise the first physician who made in Cordova the antidote called  “ al-férik,'* and determined the proper plants that ought to enter into its composition.'* Nor  “ was Hasdéy the only physician who worked on the books of Dioscorides; other eminent  men laboured sedulously to re-establish the right reading of the names of plants, and to find  “ their equivalents in Arabic. Of this number were Mohammed, known by the surname of  “ Ash-shajjér,* another man called Al-busdbisi,'®> Abi ’Othmén Al-jezzér,'° known by the  “ surname of Al-yébisah,7 Mohammed Ibn Sa’id, the physician, ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Is’hék  “Ibn Haytham,'* and Abt ’Abdillah As-sakili (of Sicily), who knew and spoke Greek well,  * and was besides an eminent physician and botanist. All the above-mentioned individuals  “ were contemporaries of the monk Nicolaus, and lived, in the days of the Khalif Al-mus-  “ tanser,!9 in Cordova, where I knew them in my youth, and profited by their lessons and  “ experience.

Two volumes, out of the many which compose this invaluable production, are in the Library of  the British Museum. No. 9574 contains the mukaddamdt or prolegomena. It is a large quarto,  containing one hundred and ninety-nine folios, written in the Maghrebi or Western hand, upon thick  brown paper. The age of the MS. is nowhere stated, but, if I am to judge from its general appearance,  I do not hesitate to say that it was written before the sixteenth century of our era.

"    xxviii APPENDIX.    of all the chapters are written in blue, red, or green ink, and the first leaf, part of which has been  torn, is richly ornamented with gold. The text also is pointed throughout,—a circumstance of no  little value in a work like the present, which is written in a highly figurative style, full of metaphorical  expressions and idioms borrowed from the African dialects,—and the transcript seems not only to be  faithful, but is undoubtedly the work of one well versed in the grammar of his own language. The margins  of the manuscript are filled with the scribblings of a late possessor, but these are in most instances  of little or no importance. The volume is defective at the end, wanting one, or at the most two leaves, the  last one being also very much damaged. I find, likewise, that the volume has since been bound and  paged wrong, and that in order to follow the narrative it is necessary to shift continually from one  end of the volume to another. In the short extracts that I am now going to give I had to follow  these numbers, 125, 120, 119, 117, 118, 116, 141, &c. However, with all its imperfections, I consider  it to be one of the most valuable Arabic manuscripts in the Library of the British Museum. It is bound  together with a fragment-of Al-jiizi’s history described elsewhere. See Preface, and Note 2, p. 403.   No. 9575 is a volume in folio of two hundred and four leaves. To judge from the title-page, it  would contain the sixth and seventh part of Ibnu Khaldin’s work. But, upon close examination, I  find that its contents are the end of the second book and the greater part of the third. It begins  with the fourth tabakah or division (the last in the second book), treating of the tribes of Arabian  origin which settled in Africa; and, at fo. 40, proceeds to the third book on the history of the  Berbers, which occupies all the rest of the volume. The transcript,—which from the note at the  end appears to have been executed by a certain 'Abdu-l-wahhéb Ibn Mohammed Abf-s-sa’4dét Ibn  Mohammed Hejéz{, of the sect of Shéf’f, who terminated it on Friday the twenty-first of the month of  Rejeb, a.a. one thousand and ninety-four (June, a.p. 1683),—is written in the Egyptian hand upon thick  glazed paper. The titles of the chapters are written in red, and the genealogical trees of the respective  tribes are drawn with tolerable accuracy. Proper and geographical names are occasiénally pointed,  and the ILA)! we Gin (‘thus far reaches the collating’), which now and then appear on the margins of  the volume, show that some care was taken in its transcription. Nevertheless, faults both in the  text and in the spelling of proper names are frequent, a circumstance which renders this volume much  less valuable than the preceding. ,   The following extracts on the civil and military offices of the Arabs are taken from the first of the  above-described volumes, out of a long chapter of the third mukaddamah, which Ibnu Khaldin consecrated  exclusively to that object, entitled x li!] ; gpabull o AY Wl. AP) oi ‘chapter treating of  the charges of the kingdom, and those of the Sultén, and their names.’ This I had translated entire  with the view of including it in this Appendix, as the information we possess on the civil and military  offices and the general system of administration of the Arabs is exceedingly scanty; but the fear of  swelling this volume beyond its proper limits makes me abstain from it, and merely extract such pas-  sages as are most calculated to throw. light upon the present narrative.    Fo. 125, verso.—The charge of Wizir (wizérah) among the Beni Umeyyah of Andalus was  at first preserved in its primitive state, and in the very acceptation of that word.?

"    .    APPENDIX. XXix    care of a Wizir. For instance, the financial department was given to one Wizir; the writing  of the correspondence to another; the inspection of memorials from people who considered  themselves wronged or oppressed to another; the defence of the frontiers, and the provision  and equipment of the troops stationed on them, was placed under the superintendence of another.  These Wizirs had a room allotted to them, where they sat in council on cushions prepared  for them, and from which they issued orders in the Sultén’s name, each in his own depart-  ment. They were presided over by one chosen out of their number, who sat also on a  cushion higher than his colleagues, and was distinguished by the appellation of Hajib. It  was the duty of this latter functionary to act as messenger from the council to the Sultan,  going to and from, and communicating to the assembled body the intentions or the wishes of,  the sovereign. Things continued in this state until the empire of the Beni Umeyyah was  overthrown, when the office of the Hajib rose so much in dignity and importance as to  become superior to any other office in the state. So much was this the case that the petty  rulers (who shared among themselves the dominions of the Khalifs) not unfrequently assumed  the title of Hajib, as we shall have further occasion to observe.  * * * * * * *   The Almohades at first being rather inclined to the nomadic life, neglected this as well as  other offices of the dynasties that preceded them; but when in the course of time they  acquired a taste for the life in cities, they began to assume different titles, and to give the  name of Wizir to the holder of a charge, which at first was preserved in all its purity. After  this they took for a model the dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah, and imitated their conduct in  all the affairs of government, giving the title of Wizir to that officer who had under his care  the curtain or screen in the royal chamber, or who stood by it in order to announce to the  Sultén the visitors, and those who entered his presence for the confirmation of a sentence, or  to address him, as well as the poets and literary men who frequently attended their court.  In this manner they exalted the charge of Hajib as much as they wished; things having  since continued in the same state until our present time. God is the supreme ruler!    Fo. 120, verso.—Al-hajdbah (the charge of the H4jib). We have already stated that the  title of Hajib was exclusively given under the empire of the Beni ’Abbas to that officer who  screened the Sultén from the eyes of his subjects, and who shut his door or opened it to them  according to the will of the sovereign, and at the hours appointed by him. The office then  was not only one of great distinction, but even superior in authority to all others, since the  Wizir himself had to apply to its holder in order to obtain an interview with the Sultén. It  continued to be such during the reign of the succeeding Khalifs, and is still so at the moment  we write. In Egypt, however, it is subordinate to the highest office of the state, which is that  of the Nayib. Among the Egyptians the H4jib is that officer who moves before the Sultén,  and who stands behind him on state occasions, or when he gives audiences to his subjects.   During the government of the Beni Umeyyah in Andalus, the name of Hajib was given to  that officer whose duty was to screen or veil the Sultdn from the eyes of his subjects, and to  be a sort of intermediary between his sovereign and the Wizirs, or their inferiors, as we have",651,,
"    XXX APPENDIX.    observed elsewhere. As long as the dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah lasted, the office of the  Hajib was one of the highest importance in the state, as thou mayest read in the histories of  Ibn Hadid and other Hajibs. So great were the honours attached to that post, that when  the attacks upon that dynasty commenced, the usurpers assumed the title of Hajib, as did  Al-mansir and his two sons after him. Even the rulers of petty kingdoms who came after-  wards, and who, not content with usurping the titles, assumed also all the power of royalty,  far from relinquishing the title of Hajib when they possessed it, assumed it upon every  occasion, regarding it as an honourable distinction. So much was this the case, that the  most powerful among them by the extent and the nature of his dominions would not  hesitate, after assuming all the titles of royalty, to add to his other titles those of Héjib*  and Dhi-l-wizdrateyn, or the holder of the two offices, that of the sword and that of the  pen,—meaning by Hajib ‘he who screens the Sultan from the eyes of his subjects,’ and by  Dhi-l-wizdrateyn ‘he that unites in himself the two powers, the civil and the military.’   The dynasties that swayed over Western and Eastern Africa had, at first, no office of this  name, owing to the nomadic habits which prevailed among their rulers. It is true that  instances may be pointed out among the Fatimites of Egypt at the time of their greatest  splendour, and when they became accustomed to the life in cities, but these are of very rare  occurrence. When the Almohades came afterwards, all their pretensions to civilisation were  not sufficient to make them assume for themselves the proper titles, nor to make the necessary  distinction between the charges of the state, nor to suit the names of these to their functions.  They had no other office at their court but that of the Wizir, which title they at first gave to  the Kéatib or secretary, who transacted business with the Sultén, or who accompanied him, as  Ibn ’Attiyyah and ’Abdu-s-salém Al-kim{. The inspection of accounts, and all other branches  of the financial department, were also committed to him. After this they gave the title of  Wiczir to all those who composed the government of the Almohades, as Ibn Jami’ and others,  but they never had either the name or the charge of Héjib among them. When the Beni Abi  Hafs took possession of the empire, the principal offices of the state remained in the hands of  the Almohades; no material change was therefore made in the institutions, and the highest  post in the state was that of the Wizir, who was at the same time a counsellor; this  functionary was called by them ‘Sheikh of the Almohades,’ and his duties consisted in the  appointment and removal of governors, the provision and maintenance of armies, and all other  military affairs. The keeping of public accounts was intrusted to an officer called Sdhibu-  l-ashghdl (the master of the occupations), because he attended to the receipt and payment  of funds, to the counting of all sums that came through his hands, and to the imposition of  taxes, as well as to the chastisement of the excesses committed in the levying of the same.  Such were the functions of the Sdéhibu-l-ashghdl. During the empire of the Almohades the  office was made exclusive to people of their sect, and was seldom conferred upon any other.  The office of the pen was then committed to a K&tib, who had under his care the writing         3 The author is mistaken. Those governors who, like Kheyran, Zohayr, and ’Abdu-l-’aziz, rose in the provinces of the  Cordovan empire after the overthrow of the Umeyyah dynasty, did not assume the title of Héjib merely because they  considered it an honorific one, but because, though all-powerful in their states, they pretended to derive, and to hold their  authority, only from the Beni Umeyyah, whose cause they upheld against the intruders of the house of Idris.",652,,
"    APPENDIX. XXxxi    of the correspondence, and to whom the secrets of the state were intrusted; but as the office  of the Kétib was not one of their assumption, and the correspondence was not written in  their own native language, it was always given without any restriction of family or sect. The  Sultan, moreover, when his empire extended, and his palace became full of applicants, saw  the want of a Kaharman,‘ chosen from among the servants of his household, to put order into his  family, to superintend the giving of alms and gifts, to guard his treasures, to take care of his  stables, and to issue the proper orders to the revenue collectors whenever money was required  for the expenses of his household. To these duties an officer was appointed whom they  called Hajib. Sometimes, even, if this functionary had a handsome hand-writing, the Sultan  would intrust him with the writing of the royal cipher upon dispatches ; if not, he would  give that charge to another.’ Things continued in this state, (the Sultén all the while  screening or veiling himself from his subjects, and the Héjib being a sort of intermediary  between the Sultén and all the people holding posts under his government,) until, in the  course of time, the direction of military affairs was intrusted to him as well as the presidency  of the council, and the office became thus gradually the highest in the state, and that which  united the most extensive and varied powers. * * *  * * * * * * *   As to ‘the Andalusians of our days, they give the name of Wakil to that functionary  who is intrusted with the keeping of the accounts, the private expenses of the Sultan, and  other pecuniary concerns; their Wizir exercises the same functions as in former times, with  this difference, that the department of the correspondence is also intrusted to him. The  Sultén, moreover, generally affixes his own cipher to the diplomas and dispatches, so that  there is no office for this purpose, as in other dynasties.    Fo. 141, verso.— Khottatu-l-ashghdl. This is the office of the keeping of the accounts and  the collection of the taxes. In former times it was customary for the Sulténs of the family of  Umeyyah (as we have stated elsewhere) to confer it upon liberated slaves, and upon Christians  or Jews,® but when the Benf ’Abbés succeeded them it was made one of the duties of the  Wizir, as happened in the case of the Beni Barmek, and of the Beni Sahl.” After this the  Sultans of the family of Umeyyah, in Andalus, and the ’Obeydites, in Africa, made it again  a distinct and separate office. The Almohades, moreover, seldom appointed to it any other  than people belonging to their sect, and the holder of the office was by them intrusted with    5    ©  ‘ we re is the name of a fabulous Persian hero.

"    XXxil APPENDIX.    the superintendence of the imposition and levying of taxes, the entrance of these upon  the books, the revision of the accounts kept by the treasurers and collectors, and the  expenditure of the sums thus raised according to their amount and at the proper time. The  functionary invested with this authority was called among them Sdhibu-l-ashghdl. However,  the office was not always exclusively held by Almohades, for in some districts of their  empire one might meet with such functionaries who had never belonged to their sect, and who  fulfilled, nevertheless, their duties to the satisfaction of their employers. For instance, when  the Beni Abi Hafs came to power, and the events took place which led to the emigration of  great numbers of the people of Andalus, there came to this country (Africa proper) many  individuals of the best families in the land, some of whom had exercised similar functions in  Andalus. Of this number were the Beni Sa’id, Lords of Al-kal’ah, near Granada, who were  also known by the appellative of Beni Abj-l-huseyn.? On their arrival in this country they  were intrusted with the same offices they had held in Andalus, filling them in turn with the  principal men among the Almohades. In this manner they held the above-mentioned office,  until, in the course of time, its duties were committed to clerks and Katibs, and the office  went altogether out of the hands of the Almohades. After this, the Héjib having risen in  authority and importance, and his orders being obeyed in every department of the admi-  nistration, the attributes and powers of the Sdhibu-l-ashghdl were gradually obliterated; the  holder of that office became subordinate to the Héjib, he was reduced to the station of a mere  tax-collector, and all that power and authority which he formerly enjoyed disappeared at  once. Under the present ruling dynasty of the Beni Merin® the title of Sdhibu-lLashghdl is  given to that functionary who has to verify the accounts, to enter the sums upon his books,  and to put his signature to all accounts as a proof of his having revised them and their being  correct ; his revision, however, being subject to that of the Sultén or his Wizir.    Fo. 142, verso.—By Shortah we now understand the office of the Hékem, whom the people  of Andalus call Sdhibu-l-medinah. The functions of this officer, which originated in the  dynasty of the Beni ’Abbés, consisted in trying criminal offences in the first stage, issuing  sentences after the trial, and seeing these executed; for those trials where more than one  criminal were implicated, and where the offence could not be satisfactorily and promptly  charged to one, were not of his inspection; there being some formalities to perform, to which  he (the Haékem), invested as he was with almost exclusive powers, and stimulated by his  friends to attend to the welfare of the people, scorned to submit. That officer, therefore,  who tried criminal offences in a summary manner, and issued sentences upon them whenever  the Kadi would not interfere, was the Sdhibu-sh-shortah. The Beni ’Abbés exalted the office,  and granted considerable powers to its holder, investing with it their maulis and favourites,  although their jurisdiction never extended over the people in general, but merely over the              8 It is said by Ibnu Khaldun, in another part of his work, that the Benf Sa’fd (the same family to which I have so often  alluded in the course of my notes, see pp. 416, 440,) were for upwards of two centuries in possession of the office of tax-  collectors in the provinces of Granada and Malaga.   % The Beni Merin began to rule in Africa towards the beginning of the thirteenth century of our era.",654,,
"    APPENDIX. xxxiii    rabble, or those who gave scandal. During the reign of the Beni Umeyyah in Andalus its  power and dignity having increased, the office was divided into Shortatu-I-kobra (great Shortah)  and Shortatu-s-soghra (small Shortah) ; the powers of the former being made to extend not  only to the rabble, but to the higher classes also, and even to persons holding places under  government, so much so that the Sdhié (holder) of the great Shortah could at any time visit an  offence committed by any prince of the blood, his most intimate maulis, or his nearest relations :  such were the powers and authority with which the office was gradually invested. The Sdhid  of the small Shortah enjoyed no such powers, and his jurisdiction merely extended to the lower  classes of the people. It was customary for the Sdhid of the great Shortah to issue his judg-  ments from the top of a throne or seat erected for him at the gate of the Sultan’s palace, round  which all those who applied to him for justice sat on the spot allotted to them by the guards,  not one being allowed to stir from it without previous leave from the Sdhib. The office moreover  was usually conferred on the most noble and wealthy citizens, and became a sort of school for  Wizirs and H4jibs. However, at the court of the Almohades, who were very lucky in some of  their gubernative regulations, the office was not conferred on men of the higher classes indis-  criminately, (as happened during the dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah ;) it was given only to  men professing their religious sect, and following their party, and generally to the most  eminent among them; neither was the holder of the office invested with authority to issue  judgments in cases wherein people holding situations under government were concerned. In  our times the powers of this officer have fallen very much into disuse, the office itself has  gone out of the hands of the Almohades, and passed into those of the people who raised  their power upon the ruins of that dynasty. God is the inverter of night and day!

The holder of it  is called Al-meland,"" originally a Frank word, meaning, in the language of that nation, ‘the  commander of the fleet.’ The office existed always in Eastern and Western Africa, where it  deserved particular attention from the respective sovereigns of those countries, owing to the  geographical position of their dominions, placed as they are on the southern coast of the Sea  of Riim; since [it is well known that] on the southern side of this sea is the country of the  Berbers, extending from Ceuta to Alexandria and Syria, while on the opposite side, to the  north, are the countries of Andalus, Afranj, Sclavonia, and Greece, joining also Syria.

For, as we have already stated, most of the wars  which the Greeks, the Franks, and the Goths who inhabit the northern shores of the Sea  of Rim had to sustain against one another, as likewise most of the traffic in which they  were engaged, were carried on by sea and in vessels, owing to which they early became  expert and accomplished navigators, and kept fleets well manned and stored to wage war  on their enemies or to defend their possessions. Thus, whenever any of those nations  inhabiting the northern shores of the Mediterranean quarrelled with those living on the  southern coast, they would send their fleets against them, (as happened in the case of  the Franks against the people of Eastern Africa, and of the Goths against those of Maghreb,)  conquer the country, subdue the Berbers, take the empire out of their hands, and gain  possession of their principal and best populated cities, as Carthage, Subeytalah, Jelaula,  Marnék, Sharshél, Tangiers, &c. On the other hand, the people of this country would  also retaliate upon their enemies, as did the King of Carthage, who in ancient times  made war on the King of Rome, sending numerous and well-appointed fleets, filled with  men and stored with arms and provisions, to invade his dominions. This was, indeed, a  common practice among the people who then inhabited the shores of Africa, and who  became thereby famous in ancient history, and gained much renown.   When the Moslems achieved the conquest of Egypt, the Khalif Omar Ibnu-]-khattab,  who then commanded, wrote to his lieutenant, ’Amru Ibnv-l-’éss, asking him for a descrip-  tion of the sea. The answer sent him by ’Amru was as follows: “ The sea is a great pool,  which some inconsiderate people furrow, looking like worms on logs of wood.”"" On the  receipt of this answer, the Khalif ""Omar forbade the Moslems to navigate the sea, and  so it was that, as long as that Khalif lived, no Arab dared go on board a vessel unless  he had his previous leave, without which requisite the transgression was severely punished,  as happened in the case of Harthamah"" Ibn ’Arfajah Al-azd{, Lord of Bajilah,’* who,  having been sent with an expedition to Oman, is reported to have attacked that country  by sea against his express orders. This prohibition lasted until the reign of Mu’awiyah,  the first Khalif who allowed the Moslems to embark, and who sent maritime expeditions  against the enemies of his empire. But the real cause [of the prohibition] was, that when  the Arabs began their conquests they were entirely unaccustomed to that element, and unfit  for navigation; while, on the contrary, the Romans and the Franks, through their almost  continual practice, and their education in the midst of the waves, were enabled to navigate  the seas, and, by dint of experience and successive enterprise, to become almost congenial to  that element.   But when the empire of the Arabs was consolidated, and its forces had increased,—when         -7 6 e deece aan    Maye gle 050 inns gle aS poke Gis  MEL» yp iste seve nw",656,,
"    APPENDIX. XXXV    all the barbarous nations who did not profess Islém became either the subjects or the slaves  of the Moslems,—all those who were in possession of any art or branch of industry whatsoever  hastened to communicate and impart it to them; and the Moslems, anxious to profit by the  learning of the vanquished, did not remain inactive. They at first solicited the services of  expert navigators, and employed foreign pilots'* in all their maritime concerns; little by little  their knowledge increased; their voyages and expeditions became more frequent; they  improved even the science of navigation, and became exceedingly fond of naval expeditions.  To accomplish this they built every where ships and galleys,'® and, having provided them  with crews and stores, they put to sea and subdued several of the infidel nations lying  beyond the waters, especially those inhabiting countries nearest to this sea (the Medi-  terranean) or living on its shores, as Syria, Eastern and Western Africa, and Andalus. In  the time of the Beni Aghlab there were already in Africa several fleets manned by Moslems.  The Khalif ’Abdu-l-malek was the first who gave Hassén, son of An-no’mén, then his  lieutenant in Africa, instructions to possess himself of the arsenal in Tiinis, to build vessels,  and to collect all kinds of maritime stores, so as to enable the Arabs to continue by sea  their conquests and incursions. It was with these vessels that Sicily was conquered by  Asad, son of Al-forét, the chief eunuch and commander of the armies of Ziy4datullah I.,  son of Ibréhim Ibn Al-aghlab. In the same manner the island of Corsica * was taken during  the reign of this monarch, and in former times- Mu’awiyah, son of Khodeyj,’” had made a  maritime incursion against Sicily during the Khalifate of Mu’awiyah Ibn Abi Sufyén. After  this the fleets of Africa proper, under the dynasty of the ’Obeydites, and those of Andalus  under that of the Beni Umeyyah, became hostile to each other, and, during the civil dissen-  sions that divided the Moslems of these two ‘countries, the armed fleets of both powers  were continually employed backwards and forwards, visiting the ports, the shores, and the  creeks, and other accessible places on the coast, with plunder and destruction.   The maritime forces of Andalus were at one time very considerable. Under *Abdu-r-  rahmaén An-néssir the number of vessels composing the royal fleet amounted to nearly  two hundred. Those of Africa proper were nearly equal in number. The commander-in-  chief of the naval forces of Andalus was a certain Ibn Roméhis;'* the ports where the ships  were put in to be careened or fitted with sails were Bejénah and Almeria. The fleet of  the Andalusian sovereigns was generally composed of vessels from all their states, each port  or city sending out a proportionate number. Each vessel was put under the command  of a chief experienced in maritime affairs, and whose duty it was to direct the forces and  to take care of the arms and other warlike stores, while the direction of the vessel was  intrusted to the Reis, whose duty consisted in regulating the course of the ship, and seeing  whether she was to sail or to go with oars. When the ships were all assembled together  for a naval expedition, and the object and intention of the Sultan were made known, the  fleet always went to a port and there cast anchor;.the Sultén then manned it with his  best and bravest soldiers, or with his own freedmen and clients, and the whole was put         “ The word which the author here uses for pilots is a5 3} oo from the Latin naxta.

This commander, who was obeyed by the whole fleet, then presented himself  before the crews, and addressed them, putting before their minds victory and spoil. During  the reign of the various Mohammedan dynasties the Moslems were victorious in all the  corners of this sea, and their power and supremacy increased. None of the Christian  nations had the least chance with their fleets in these waters, and our countrymen accustomed  the sea for the rest of their days to bear the weight of their victories. Their maritime  expeditions were crowned with success, and attended with victory and plunder. In this  manner they conquered many islands standing far into the sea, as Mallorca, Menorca, Iviza,  Sicily, Corsica, Malta, and Crete; they even made incursions upon the shores of Genoa,  Sardinia, and other maritime districts belonging to the Franks. Abvii-l-késim Ash-shi’éy,  and his two sons, sailing from the port of Mahdiyyah, invaded several times the island of  Genoa, and returned victorious and laden with spoils. In four hundred and five (a. D. 1014-5)  Mujéhid Al-’dmiri, governor of Denia, and one of those who, during the civil war in Andalus,  broke all allegiance to the Khalifate of Cordova, and declared themselves independent,  effected a landing on the island of Sardinia and conquered it; and although the Christians  again gained possession of it, the Moslems were not the least disheartened by the reverse, for,  being the masters of most of the harbours in this sea, their fleets scoured it in all directions.  Those of Sicily, especially, so much annoyed the inhabitants of the shores of the Mediter-  ranean, and of all that country lying opposite us to the north, that they were obliged to  seek refuge in distant lands, and retire with their vessels to the north-east on the shores  of France, Sclavonia, and the islands of the Greek Archipelago (where the Moslem fleets  never reached); for if ever a Moslem vessel came upon a Christian one in these seas,  the latter was sure of meeting with the same fate as the wild animal of the woods with -  the lion. Most of the harbours in these seas were then filled with men and military stores,  and their waters were furrowed by innumerable Moslem vessels,'® in time of peace as well  as in time of war, in such manner that no Christian vessel ever dared show itself at any  time. This state of things continued until the ’""Obeydites and the Beni Umeyyah decayed,  and their governments becoming weak and corrupt, they were seized by cowardice and imbe-  cility, when the Christians, profiting by it, extended their hands, and laid them upon the  islands of this sea, such as Sicily, Crete, Malta, and others, which they invaded and took.  They then directed their forces against the coast of Syria, and took possession of a great  part of it, making themselves the masters of Jerusalem, where they built a church for their  worship and religion.

Soon after this  they took possession of Mahdiyyah, the court of the Obeydite Sulténs, which they conquered  from the Beni Balkin Ben Zeyri, a family who had known prosperous times in the fifth  century of the Hijra.   In the meanwhile the western sides of this sea not only were well guarded against any  sudden attack, and provided with numerous vessels, but there was not the least chance  for the enemy in that quarter; for, during the reign of the Lamtumnite Sultdns, their  fleets were commanded by the Beni Maymiin, who were independent governors of Cadiz.  When after this *’Abdu-l-miimen, Sultén of the Almohades, established his empire in  Andalus, and took Cadiz from the Beni Maymin, these chiefs, seeing that all resistance  was useless, surrendered and swore allegiance to him, continuing all the time to serve  in his fleets. Their vessels, which at one time amounted to one hundred, the Almohades  drew from their states on the Andalusian and African shore. But when that dynasty be-  came stronger by extending its sway over both Andalus and Africa, the command of the  fleet was made by them a post of the greatest importance, and they bestowed upon this  branch of their government more care and attention than had ever been bestowed by their  predecessors. The command of their fleets was therefore given to a certain Ahmed Al-sakili  (the Sicilian), who drew his origin from the tribe of Sadiiikush,” a branch of the great family  of the Sadghiyér, inhabiting the island of Jerbah. This man had, when young, been taken  prisoner by the Christians, who, having landed on the island (Jerbah), took him with others  into captivity, and carried him to their country (Sicily), where he lived and grew among them.  In the course of time, however, he was liberated by the governor of Sicily, who, being satisfied  with his services, was exceedingly kind to him. This governor having died, and being  - succeeded in command by his son, Ahmed was ill used by him in a dispute, when, not con-  sidering himself safe in Sicily, he made his escape, repaired to Tiinis, and presented himself  to the governor. From thence he went to Morocco, where he was honourably and kindly  treated by the Khalif Yusuf Al-asri,* who made him a plentiful allowance, and appointed  him to the command of his fleet. No sooner did Ahmed As-sakili see himself at the head  of the Moslem fleet, than he began to undertake expeditions against the Christians, gaining  over them more than one signal victory, by which means the naval power of the Moslems  attained in his time, and under the dynasty of the Almohades, a degree of splendour and  strength which it was never known to possess either before or afterwards.         founded a powerful, but ephemeral, empire in Eastern Africa, having been soon after dispossessed by the Christians ; since  according to Ibnu Khalddn in his history of the Berbers, (No. 9575, fo. 72, verso,) Roger, first King of Sicily, having  dispatched in a.a. five hundred and sixteen (a. p. 1122-3) a fleet under the command of Jorge (George), son of Michael,    of Antiochia, vlate ot gh y> © ravage the coast of Africa, the Christian Admiral was completely successful: he  took the cities of Mahdiyyah, Safékis, Tripoli, and Stisah.  ) Ky dw — eo Tbnu Khalddn says in another part of his work (No. 9575, fo. 179) that the Sadghiyér (or    as there written Sadghiyan) and the Saddikush were two branches of the tribe of Kota’mah, by whom the island of Jerbah  was principally peopled.  ® Abd Ya’kdb Yusuf, the second Sultan of the Almohades.",659,,
"    XXXVili APPENDIX.    When Salahu-d-din (Saladin) Ibn Ayiib, Sultan of Egypt and Syria, stirred himself to  snatch from the hands of the Christians such fortresses and cities as they had taken on  the frontiers of Syria, and to cleanse Jerusalem and its buildings from the filth of the infidels,  the fleets and expeditions of the idolaters increased on every side, and innumerable vessels  furrowed the seas from all the ports near Jerusalem, in order to convey supplies and reinforce-  ments to those among their countrymen who held that city. At that time the naval forces of  Alexandria could by no means compete with those of the Christians, owing to the repeated  victories which the latter had gained in the eastern part of this sea, their numerous forces, and  the weakness of the Moslems, who had been for a long time previous in a state of decadence,  and without sufficient forces to oppose their undertakings. In this conflict Saladin addressed  himself to Ya’kub Al-manstr, Sultén of Al-maghreb, and one of the Almohades, and asked  him, through his ambassador ’Abdu-l-kerim Ibn Munkadh, the assistance of his navy in  order to prevent the fleets of the idolaters from taking provisions and reinforcements to  their brethren in Syria. Saladin’s letter, which, according to Al-’omméd Al-asfahéni, in his  work entitled ‘the signal victories,’ was the composition of the illustrious writer Al-bisénf,  bore these words on the outside, “ May God open for the majesty of our lord the gates  of happiness and security!” But Al-mansiir having observed that he was not addressed in  the letter as Amir al-mtimenin (prince of the believers), was exceedingly annoyed by it,  although he kept it a secret and did not communicate his displeasure to any one; so  though he treated the ambassador with justice and generosity, he dismissed him from his  court without granting his demand. We have mentioned this merely to let the reader form  an idea of the maritime power of the Sulténs of Maghreb at this time, and sketch what  happened to them with the Christians in the eastern quarters, and how these acquired a  superiority in those seas.   However, after the death of Ya’ktib Al-mansiir, and the decadence which ensued of his  empire, the Galicians having made themselves the masters of almost all the kingdoms which  the Moslems possessed in Andalus, the true believers were obliged to fly for shelter to those  provinces situate on the sea shore. The infidels, in the course of time, conquered all the  islands in the west of the Mediterranean; their power increasing on those waters, and their  fleets becoming very numerous: so that the forces of the Moslems were soon on a level with  those of the Christians, as became manifest during the reign of the Sultén Abi-l-hasan,  King of the Zenatah, in Al-maghreb, whose fleets, whenever they put to sea and met the  enemy, had to contend against an equal number of vessels. This evil went on increasing  until the Mohammedan power fell gradually into decay, and the science and practice of na-  vigation were almost forgotten, owing to the inclinations of the Sultans of that dynasty, who,  being Beydawis or Bedouins, did not much relish the sea. This contributed to interrupt the  traffic and the communication with Andalus by sea, and allowed the Christians to resume  their old habits, and recommence their adventurous enterprises, thus becoming again by  their experience and their continual sailing the masters of the seas. The Moslems, on the  contrary, became quite strangers to navigation, if we except a few of the people inhabiting  the coast, who seemed still to possess some inclination to that element, and who, through the  help and assistance of all kinds bestowed on them by the African powers, have hitherto been  enabled to maintain the holy war by sea. In this state has the navy continued until our days,",660,,

Nay, if we are to believe a prophecy current among the people of this country, the Moslems  shall recover in the end their naval superiority over the Christians, and conquer all those  countries lying across the sea where their religion is predominant; this being accomplished  by means of their fleets. May Allah favour the Moslems!         APPENDIX C.    An account of Al-hakem’s Library and its destruction, extracted from the work of S@id,  of Toledo.    Tur volume from which the following extract is taken is a thin octavo, containing 146 pages; it is  written incorrectly, and in a sort of hand approaching the ta’lik. The title reads thus: ow Wis    IBM cele gp del gp dele pull gl gall GE poll oli Cy gill us  i | ‘Hasty notes or extracts taken from the work (entitled) the book of information on the  daub! ty    classes of nations,’ by the K4di Abu-l-késim Sé’id Ibn Ahmed Ibn Sé’id, of Toledo. But although,  immediately after the title, there follow in the MS. extracts from the work of that historian, the contents  of the volume, which is written in different hands, are various. The first twenty-two pages only of the  MS. are extracts from the work of Sé’id. After this come two chapters from the Koran. Then follow  other extracts from Ibnu Sa’id Al-maghrebi and Abi-l-fed4é; and, lastly, the volume ends with an    historical work, in Turkish, entitled, if I am not mistaken, 2 gall Pd “the necklace of the annals.’    The first part of the volume (i.e. the extracts from Sé'id, of Toledo,) is exceedingly interesting,  being the only fragment preserved in any Library of Europe from the work of an historian who enjoys  great reputation among his countrymen ; a work which, were we to judge of its contents by the short  extracts in this volume, must have been one of the greatest value.   Sa’id begins by giving a concise history of mankind, divided into various races or nations,—Ancient  Persians, Chaldeans, Greeks, Copts, Turks, Hindus, and Chinese. He then divides mankind into nations  who laboured for the attainment of science, and nations who did not do so; he counts among the former  the Hindus, Persians, Chaldeans, Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Arabs, and Hebrews, including the re-  mainder in the number of those who did not cultivate the sciences. He then begins with a short account  of each of them, and, after giving a concise history of those nations who exhibited a taste for learning,  proceeds with a sketch of their improvements in the sciences, and the eminent men they produced.  The account he gives of the Greeks and Romans is well worthy of attention, and, considering that it  is the work of an Arabian writer, is sufficiently accurate. It is from the chapter treating of the  Arabs that the following extract is taken.   The author is S4’id Ibn Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Ibn Mohammed Ibn Sé’id, K4di of Toledo, of the",661,,
"    xl APPENDIX.    sect of Mélik. He was a native of Almeria, but his family were originally from Cordova. He died,  according to Ibnu Bashkiwél, quoted by Casiri (Bib. Ar. Hisp. Esc. vol. ii. p. 142, c. 2), on the 4th  day of Shawwé4l, a. a. 462, and not as H4ji Khalfah (voc. Ta’rif) states, in 250. I cannot imagine what  made that accurate bibliographer commit such a mistake, since there can be no doubt that the work was  written during the reign of Yahya Ibn Isma’il, who filled the throne of Toledo until 469, and who  appointed Sé’id to the charge of Kadi of the principal mosque in the capital of his dominions. He  himself says so, and alludes in several places of his work to his being occupied in its composition in the  year 460. Besides, in the note at the end of these extracts, it is also stated that Sé’id completed his  work in that year.    But to return to our account of the Andalusian philosophers. Towards the middle of the  third century of the Hijra, and in the days of the Amir Mohammed, Sultan of Cordova, and  the fifth in the line of the Beni Umeyyah, the learned of Andalus exerted themselves in the  cultivation of science, and laboured in it with assiduity, giving evident proofs of their  acquisitions in all manner of learning. This continued until towards the middle of the fourth  century, when the Sultén Al-hakem, son of the Sultén ’Abdu-r-rahmén An-nAssir lidini-lah,  having ascended the throne, the cultivation of letters received a new impulse, and by his  encouragement of all sorts of studies, by his unwonted liberality towards the learned, whom  he invited to his capital from Baghdad, Cairo, and other distant countries, and, above all, by  his exquisite taste for literature, which he had cultivated with success during his father’s life-  time, the torch of science shone brighter than ever. Indeed, this illustrious monarch spared  neither trouble nor expense to propagate learning in his states by all the means in his power.  He caused all sorts of rare and curious books to be purchased by his agents in Cairo, Baghdad,  Damascus, Alexandria, and other great cities in the East; and no work on ancient or modern  science was discovered that was not immediately procured at any cost and sent to him. By  these means he collected a richer and more extensive library than the Khalifs of the Abbaside  dynasty ever did during the whole period of their reign, and the learned of Andalus devoted  their attention to the study of the sciences contained in the books of the ancients, and,  encouraged by the example of the monarch, made rapid progress in the most abstruse and  exquisite learning. This lasted until the death of the Khalif Al-hakem, which happened in  the month of Safar of the year three hundred and sixty-six (Oct. a.p. 976), when he was  succeeded by his son, Hisham Al-muyad-billah, who was still very young. However, when  the Wizir Abi ’A’mir Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Abi ’A’mir  Mohammed Ibni-l-walid Ibn Yezid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek Ibn ’A’mir Al-mu’éferi Al-kahttani  usurped the empire, as is well known, and took the direction of public affairs entirely into his  hands, he followed a different course, and in order to conciliate the favour of theologians, and  other austere men who were averse to the cultivation of the philosophical sciences, commanded  a search to be made in Al-hakem’s library, and all works on philosophy and astronomy and  other similar subjects treated by the ancients, with the exception of books on medicine and  arithmetic, were by his orders removed, and either burnt in the squares of the city, or thrown  into the wells and cisterns of the palace, where they were soon destroyed by the heaps of  dust, stones, and other rubbish cast over them. The only books which were suffered to  remain in Al-hakem’s library were works treating of rhetoric, grammar, poetry, history,",662,,
"    APPENDIX. . xli    medicine, law, traditions, and other sciences generally cultivated by the people of Andalus;  and all others treating either of natural philosophy, astronomy, or the doctrines of the  ancients, were, with the exception of a few which escaped the eyes of the searchers, destroyed  for ever. This act of Al-mansir has been attributed by the historians of the time to his  desire of gaining popularity with the multitude, and thereby finding less opposition to his  ambitious views, and casting a sort of stain upon the memory of the Khalif Al-hakem, whose  throne he sought to usurp; for, although the study of those sciences had been forbidden by  his ancestors, Al-hakem encouraged them in his dominions, and countenanced and protected  all those who cultivated them. Al-mansiir, however, having publicly shown his disap-  probation of these studies, all those who were found indulging in them were declared impious  men by the heads of the law, so that the learned had carefully to conceal their knowledge of  these matters for fear of coming into contact with the judges, and being condemned as  heretics and people who wanted to introduce new practices and opinions on the received  religion. Whoever, therefore, had formerly studied and taught the philosophical sciences  publicly, had now to conceal his learning from his most intimate friends, for fear of being  denounced ; and if he still persevered in his studies he would do it with the greatest secrecy,  taking care not to raise the least suspicion by his words or by his writings, which he would  publicly confine to medicine, arithmetic, moral philosophy, and so forth.   This state of things lasted until the overthrow of the Beni Umeyyah dynasty, when the  dominions of that powerful family fell to the share of the rebels who rose against them at the  beginning of the fifth century of the Hijra, and who divided among themselves the inheritance  of the Khalifs. These petty sovereigns, it is true, encouraged literature, but their efforts were  principally directed towards poetry, grammar, history, and other common arts; and the  proscribed sciences remained as before in complete disgrace. In the meanwhile the city of  Cordova was occupied sometimes by one, sometimes by another, of these rebel princes; and  the temporary masters of the capital claiming, as was natural, a supremacy over the rest of  Andalus, the fire of discord was kindled, and its consuming flames spread rapidly through  this country, destroying every where the monuments of the arts and the sciences. In one  of these civil dissensions Cordova was invaded and sacked, the palace of the Khalifs was  levelled with the ground, and the costly furniture, the rich tapestry, the splendid collection of  books formed by Al-hakem, were plundered, and sold in distant countries at the lowest prices.  However, most of the literary treasures which the royal library contained were scattered  through this country; some were taken to Seville, some to Granada, some to Almeria and  other principal cities; 1 myself met with many in this city (Toledo) that were saved from  the general ruin, and in the number there were a few which escaped the search and  destruction made in the days of Al-manstir, and whose contents might, if detected, have  brought upon them a similar fate. .   With these precious relics the study of the works of the ancient philosophers revived, the  learned of this country began again to graze and feed upon the pasturages of philosophy, the  studious acquired little by little a taste for the natural sciences ; the petty sovereigns of Andalus  bestowing some encouragement upon their professors until the present day, being the year    VOL.

"    xli APPENDIX.    460 of the Hijra,' when it may be confidently asserted, without fear of contradiction, that the  above-mentioned studies are more flourishing than ever they were in this country, and more  extensively cultivated than the most easy and common branches of learning. God be praised  for it! Their progress, however, might be still quicker, were it not impeded by the austerity  and devotion of some of our kings, who, like their predecessors, have a dislike for them; were  it not that the learned of our times are year after year obliged to lay down the pen, and,  grasping the sword, to repair to the defence of our frontiers attacked by the infidels, whose  continual invasions they could not otherwise resist; this being the reason why the study of  science is not so universal as it ought to be, and that the learned are but few.              APPENDIX D.    A narrative of the principal events attending the conquest of Spain by the Moslems, translated  from the Talal ust o5 SUSI) LAS Kitdbu-Liktifa fi akhbéri-Lkholafé, or ‘the  book of sufficiency on the history of the Khalifs) by Abi Jafar Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakk Al-  khazrdjt Al-kortobt (Ar. MS. in the translator’s collection).    Tus MS. to which I allude is a folio volume of about 480 pages, written in a clear African hand,  strongly resembling the old Kuf{, upon brown cotton paper. The first four leaves and the last eight are  supplied by a modern hand, upon white paper, manufactured in Europe. Owing to this circumstance,  it is impossible for me to fix with certainty the age of the MS., but, were I to judge from the sort  of hand-writing used in it, and other signs which I shall presently specify, I should not hesitate in  declaring it an autograph written at Seville towards the year five hundred and seventy of the Hijra (a. p.  1174-5). My reasons for deeming it such are as follow: lst. The hand-writing is the same as that of  many Arabic MSS. of the same period in the Escurial, which are executed in a hand peculiar to Seville,    and to which Ibnu-l-khattfb frequently alludes in his history of Granada, called etd! os} “the Se-  ™ s    villian hand-writing.’ 2nd. Nowhere are the words kdla-I-muwallif (‘the author says’), kdla-l-mawarrikh  (‘ the historian relates’), and other similar expressions, which are generally met with in transcripts of  Arabic works, to be found in this. 8rd. The MS. abounds with many corrections and marginal re-  ferences, which could not be the work of a transcriber, since, in most instances, the meaning would be  incomplete without them. .   The name of the author is nowhere stated in the MS.; for although, according to the general custom,  a blank was left in the first page by the copyist who supplied the leaves, for the purpose of inserting it in  gold letters, this requisite is wanting. On the other hand, H&ji Khalfah, whose work is particularly  deficient in the literature of the Spanish Moslems, knew not the book. But as Ibnu Sa’id, in his  addition to Ibn Hazm’s epistle (see p. 194 of this translation), has spoken of an historical work whose  title and description answer exactly to those of the present, and which he there attributes to Abu Ja’far         1 S6'id survived the composition of this work only two years.",664,,
"    APPENDIX. xliii    Tbn ’Abdi-l-hakk Al-khazr4ji Al-kortobi, we may reasonably conclude, for want of a better proof, that  he was the author of the present.   The contents of the work are a very detailed and circumstantial history of the Khalifs. After a short  introduction, in which the principal events in the life of the Prophet are graphically portrayed, the author  proceeds to Abii Bekr, and the Khalifs, his successors. In the chapter treating on Al-walid, under whose  empire Spain was subdued, the author introduces a sort of episodical chapter, entitled ‘ An account of the  conquest of Andalus by the Moslems,” the same which is here translated ; he then goes on to his successor  Suleymfn, and the remaining Khalifs of the house of Umeyyah; after which he describes, although  rapidly, the foundation of the throne of Cordova by ’Abdu-r-rahmén I., and the principal events of the  reigns of his successors, until the extinction of the Umeyyah dynasty in Spain, and the breaking up of  their once powerful and compact empire into sundry ephemeral and precarious principalities. He then  relates in great detail the taking of Toledo by Alfonso VII., the subjection of Spain to the Almo-  ravides, the expulsion of these by the Almohades, &c., up to the time of Abi Yusuf Ya’kdb, surnamed  Al-mansir, who reigned from a.. five hundred and fifty-eight to five hundred and ninety-five (a. p.  1162-98); and this he does in so elegant a style, with so much order and criticism, and apparently with  such correct information, that few Arabic chronicles have passed through my hands which can compete  with it in point of utility and merit. The book ends with a history of the eastern Khalifs of the house of  *Abbés, up to the reign of Al-m&mién Mohammed, son of Al-muktafi bi-amri-llah, who began his reign in  560 of the Hijra. .   The passage which I here tranelate is of no great importance in itself, as several sentences from it  will be found already translated in the text, (Al-makkar{ having either possessed a copy of this very work,  or derived his information from writers who literally transcribed this author’s words ;) but it is highly  interesting, as giving a continuous narrative of the events attending the conquest, as they were current  in the author’s time, and as affording a proof that as early as the twelfth century of our era the fabulous  accounts and the extraordinary events coupled by the Spanish chroniclers with the Saracen invasion  were no invention of theirs, but are met with in the works of the Arabs.    An account of the conquest of Andalus.    At the time of the conquest of Africa by the Arabs, Maghreb and Andalus were in the  hands of the Riim' and Berbers. The former were in possession of Andalus and all the  opposite coast of Africa; the latter held all the interior and the deserts. Among the Berbers  there were some who listened to the voice of their preachers, and embraced Islém; others  shut their ears to it, and remained in ignorance and idolatry.   There was in Tangiers a Rimi, named Ily&n, who was Al-mukaddam? of Ludherik, King  of Andalus, who held his court at Toledo. This monarch is the same under whose reign  Andalus was invaded and subdued by the Arabs. One of the causes which is said to have  contributed most efficaciously to that event is the following. There was at Toledo a palace                   ' By Ram the African authors designate not only the Romans, the original meaning of that word, but also all those nations  who held portions of the old Roman empire, and professed Christianity. See Ibnu Khalddn’s History of the Berbers, No. 9575,  fo. 40, e¢ seg., and the note 16 to chap. i. book rv. of this translation, where the meaning of this word is satisfactorily explained.    2 The word poi Al-mukaddam means literally ‘he who goes forward, a captain of the van, the commander of a body  of troops on the enemy’s frontier.’ It is the origin of the Spanish word Almocaden, which has precisely the same meaning.",665,,
"    xliv APPENDIX.    the gate of which was secured with many locks,® for every king who ruled over that country  added a lock to the gate, and none ever dared. to open it; nor did any one know what it  contained. The number of the locks had already reached to twenty, one for each of the  kings who had governed that country when the said Ludherik ascended the throne of  Andalus. He then said, “I must have the gate of this palace opened, that I may see what  “is inside ;” but his counts and bishops said to him, “ Do no such thing, O King! Do not  “ innovate upon a custom which thy predecessors have hitherto kept most religiously.” But  Ludherik replied, “ No, you shall not persuade me, I must have it opened, and see what  “ it contains.” He then caused the gate to be thrown open, but he found nothing inside  save a large roll of parchment, on which were portrayed figures of turbaned men mounted on  generous steeds, having swords in their hands, and spears with fluttering pennons at the end.  The roll contained besides an inscription, purporting, “The men represented in this picture  “ are the Arabs, the same who, whenever the locks of this palace are broken, will invade this  “island and subdue it entirely”” When Ludherik saw this, he repented of what he had  done, and ordered the gate to be shut.   It was then the custom among the Rim for all the people of rank to send their daughters  to the royal palace, to be brought up with the daughters of their sovereign. There they were  all educated together, and taught the same accomplishments, and, when grown up, the king  would marry them to the most distinguished people of his dominions, and grant them  marriage portions, by which means he secured the affections of the husbands, the wives, and  their children. It happened that in compliance with this usage, Ilyan,* the governor of  Tangiers and Ceuta, who was one of Ludherik’s favourites, and one of the most powerful  lords of his kingdom, sent his daughter to Toledo, where she was accordingly lodged in the  king’s palace. Ily4n used to visit Ludherik once a year, in the month of August, when he  always brought with him presents for his master, such as hawks for the chase, and other  productions of Africa. Ilyén’s daughter being extremely handsome, the eye of Ludherik rested  on her, and he became deeply enamoured, but, failing in persuasion, he obtained by force  the gratification of his wishes. However, he afterwards repented of what he had done, and  ordered that his act should be kept a secret, and that the girl should be hindered from speak-  ing to any one, lest she should write to her father and acquaint him with what had occurred.  But notwithstanding all these precautions, the girl soon contrived to acquaint her father  with her situation by sending him a splendid present, and among the articles composing it a  rotten egg. No sooner did Ilyan see this than he understood the message, and saw that his  daughter had been dishonoured; he immediately crossed over to Andalus, and repaired to  Toledo, although contrary to orders, and out of the time fixed for his presentation, it being  then the month of January. When Ludherik saw Ily4n come so unexpectedly, he said to  him, “O Ilyaén! what ails thee, to come to me at this season of the year, in the depth of         3 In one of the old editions of the Cronica de Don Rodrigo (Toledo, 1549,) there is a large wood-cut which represents the  Gothic monarch in front of a strong tower, the massive door of which is secured by seven ponderous padlocks.

He then took his daughter,  and returned without loss of time to the seat of his government, where no sooner had he  arrived than he went to Ifrikiyyah (Eastern Africa), and entered Cairwaén, where the Amir  Misa Ibn Nosseyr was residing at the time. This Misa was the son of Nosseyr, son of  ’Abdu-r-rahmén, son of Zeyd Al-bekri; he was born in the year nineteen of the Hijra, under  the Khalifate of ?Omar Ibnu-l-khattéb, (may God show him his favours!) Miisa’s father had  been captain of the guard to Mu’awiyah® Ibn Ab{f Sufyén, and when that Khalif made war  against ’Ali, (may God show him his favours!) he would not accompany him, and refused to  take part in the expedition. ‘ What prevented thee,” said Mu’awiyah to him afterwards,  “from accompanying me in this expedition against *Alf, when my hand has never ceased  “ pouring favours upon thee?” “ It was not in my power,” replied Nosseyr, “to take part in  “ an impious act against him to whom I am more indebted than I am to thee.” “And who  “is he?” inquired Mu’awiyah. “God Almighty, may his name be exalted!” said Musa.  “ What!” said the Khalif, “ hast thou no gratitude for thy benefactors?” ‘ And have I not  “ shown it on several occasions?” replied Nosseyr. He then kept silence and went away,  when Mu’awiyah remained silent and thoughtful for a while, and then said, “I implore  “ God’s pardon ; may he show his favours to ’Alf!”   But, to return, Muisa obtained the government of Eastern Africa in the year seventy-nine  of the Hijra (beginning 19th March, a.p. 698), others say in seventy-eight, and was, therefore,  the viceroy of all the Arabian conquests of Eastern and Western Africa during the Khalifate  of ’Abdu-l-malek. After the death of this monarch he was confirmed in his post by his  brother and successor, Al-wélid. To this Misa, Ilyén, governor of Tangiers, came to offer  his services. He found him at Cairwén, told him what had happened to his daughter, and,  anxious to revenge the outrage on his enemy, proposed to him to make the conquest of  Andalus, an undertaking which he represented to him as being of very easy execution. He  described Andalus as an extensive kingdom, filled with treasures of all kinds, whose in-  habitants would make very handsome slaves, a country abounding in springs, gardens, rivers,  and a land yielding every description of fruit and plants. Misa, who was endowed with  much penetration and wit, and who had great experience in all the affairs of war, said to the  Christian, “ We doubt not that thou art telling us the truth, but we fear for the sake of the  “ Moslems, and the dangers they may encounter. Thou wishest them to invade a country with  “which they are not in the least degree acquainted, and from which they are separated by an  “intervening sea, while thou art bound to thy king by the common ties of the idolaters, and  “united to thy countrymen by the same customs and the same religion.

When thou hast done thus, and beguh  © hostilities, then will it be time for us to follow thy steps, if God be pleased.”   Ilyén agreed to these conditions, and prepared for his intended expedition. Misa then  wrote to Al-walid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, acquainting him with what Ilyén had proposed to him,  and the Khalif’s answer was as follows: “ Let the country be first explored by light troops, that  “thou mayest judge of the real strength of the enemy, and be sure not to be the victim of  “treason.” Ilydn in the meanwhile returned to his government, called together his men,  and, crossing the Straits in two vessels, landed at Jeziratu-l-khadhré, whence he made  incursions into the land, burning the houses and fields, killing, taking captives, and  collecting considerable spoil; after which he and his companions returned safe to Africa, their  hands filled with booty. The news of this. success soon spread over every district of Africa,  the result being that about three thousand Berbers, collected under the orders of Abii Zar’ah  Tarif Ibn Malik Al-mu’éwi, crossed the sea, and landed on an island ever since called ‘ the  island of Tarif, from the name of their general. Like their predecessors, the Berbers with  Tarif spread over the neighbouring country, making incursions, killing, and taking prisoners.  They also returned safe into Africa. Ilyén then hastened to apprise Muisa of this new  victory, and Misa informed the Khalif of it; it is even said that the very same day on which  Misa’s messenger was introduced into the Khalif’s presence, eleven more messengers, all  bearing news of similar victories obtained by the Arabs in the various quarters of the globe,  reached the court of Damascus, and that Al-walid fell immediately on his knees and praised  God. But to return.   Tlyén went a second time to Musa, and acquainted him with the success of both enterprises ;  he told him of what he had executed and the experiment he had tried, and he again  urged him to make the conquest of Andalus. This time Musa sent for his freedman Térik  Ibn Zey&d, and gave him the command of twelve thousand men, Arabs and Berbers; he  then commanded him to cross the Straits and invade Andalus, bidding Ily&n accompany  also the expedition with his own troops. Before Térik left Africa a great number of  volunteers flocked under his banners; he first went to Ceuta, and, having embarked in  vessels,? he cast anchor close to a mountain, which received his name, and was ever since  called Jebal-Térik, ‘ the mountain of Térik.’ This event took place in the year ninety-three  of the Hijra (beginning October, a.p. 711).   When Tarik was about to land he found some of the Rim posted on a commodious part of  the coast where he had intended to disembark, who made some show of resistance. But  Tarik, giving up that spot, sailed off from it at night and went towards another part of the  coast, which he contrived to render flat by means of the oars, and by throwing over them the         s sled T have said elsewhere that this word was to be read thus, Al-mughéferi.  7 wl y0 AP je (he crossed in vessels).

He then began to make incursions into the  country, and fell upon the Rim, and collected considerable spoil, penetrating as far as Cordova,  after setting fire to the vessels which had conveyed him to Spain. He said to his men,  You must either fight or die.” He met an old woman who addressed him thus: “I had  “once a husband who was learned in divination, and who used to say that a man of thy  “figure and shape, having a prominent forehead, and a black spot upon his shoulder,  “ with a mole covered with hair, would cross over to this island.” Térik then uncovered his  shoulder and showed the spot and the mole to his men, who rejoiced at the good omen, and  felt their courage very much strengthened by the fortunate circumstance.   When the news of Térik’s landing reached Ludherik, that monarch sallied out to meet him  at the head of one hundred thousand cavalry, bringing his treasures as well as his wardrobe  in waggons. The tyrant came on a litter borne by three mules placed in a row;° a vaulted  canopy, sprinkled with pearls, rubies, and the richest jewels, was spread over him to screen  him from the rays of the sun; he was dressed in a robe made of strings of pearls, interwoven  with silk, and followed by long trains of mules whose only load was ropes to pinion the  arms of the captives, for he did not doubt that he would soon make every one of the Arabs  his prisoner.   Before Tarik sailed for Andalus, Miisa fell on his knees, and began to pray, and to shed  tears, and to implore the assistance of Almighty God, and to pray most fervently for his help  and interference in favour of the Moslem troops. It has been said of him that no army which he  commanded ever fled before the enemy. However, Ludherik marched his army to Cordova,  meaning to attack Térik ; and when he came close to him he (Ludherik) chose among his host  a man of tried courage and experienced in the affairs and stratagems of war; he directed him  to go under some pretence to Térik’s camp, and observe all the movements of his men, so as  to be able to report to him on their numbers, looks, and general appearance. The man did as  he was commanded ; he approached the tents of the Moslems, and Térik, having been informed  of it, put into practice the following stratagem in order to overawe his enemies. He ordered  the flesh of the slain to be cut piecemeal, and to be dressed as if it were to be served for the  men’s repast; Térik’s men did as they were ordered, they cut up the dead bodies and cooked  the flesh in large cauldrons; and when Ludherik’s messenger saw this he doubted not but  that the Moslems fed upon dead bodies. However, Térik, having caused the human flesh to  be privately removed and buried during the night, had beef and mutton dressed in its  stead, and, when in the morning the men were summoned to partake of their repast,  Ludherik’s messenger was also invited to partake of it, and he ate along with them. The  repast concluded, the messenger returned to his master, and said to him, “Thy kingdom has  “ been invaded by a nation of people who feed upon the flesh of the slain; their description  “is the same as that found by thee in the sealed palace; they have set fire to their vessels,  “and seem determined either to conquer or to perish.” This news filled Ludherik and his  men with utter consternation, but the contest had now become inevitable, and both armies         ® Rodericus Toletanus adds that the mules were white.

"    xlviii APPENDIX.    came to an engagement on a Sunday. The Moslems sustained the fight with great courage ;  they charged desperately and at once upon the infidels, whom God was pleased to put to  flight, for their first ranks having given way, they were closely pursued by the Moslems,  dealing death among their scattered bands and making numbers of them prisoners. What  became of their king, Ludherik, nobody knows; they pretend that while flying from his  pursuers he contrived to hide himself among the bushes on the banks of the river, but that  he came up to a marsh’? and was drowned; in corroboration of which it is said that some  soldiers found one of his sandals, sprinkled with pearls and rubies, having the strings"" still  fixed to it, which no doubt fell off one of his feet. So precious were its materials that when,  after the battle, the division of the spoil was made, it was valued at one hundred thousand  dinérs. Ludherik’s camp was, moreover, completely plundered, and the Moslems spread  right and left over the country, gaining every where considerable spoils, of which Tarik  Teligiously put aside the fifth for the royal coffers, distributing the remainder among all those  present at the battle, by which means the hands of his men were filled, and all, without one  exception, became rich.   When the people on the other side of the sea were informed of Térik’s success they  flocked to him from all parts, from the East as well as from the West, and Musa dispatched  immediately a messenger to the Khalif Al-walfd, informing him of the victories gained by the  Moslems. ‘Tarik, in the meanwhile, marched to Toledo, which he took; he then went to  a place beyond that city, where he found in the principal church the table of Suleyman, son  of D&tid, (on whom be peace!) which was so beautiful to behold that whoever gazed at it the  world vanished before his eyes. It was inlaid with precious stones of various kinds and hues,  as well as with aromatic woods; it was, besides, most beautifully ornamented with several  inscriptions in the Greek tongue. But this was not the only jewel which Térik found; he  seized also on one-and-twenty copies of the Torah, the Gospels, and the Psalms, as well as a  copy of the book of Abraham, and another of that of Moses, (the salutation of our Lord be  on them!) He found, likewise, five-and-twenty royal diadems, beautifully ornamented with  jewels, one for each of the kings who had ruled over the country, since it was a custom  among them for every monarch to deposit there before his death a crown of gold bearing an  inscription indicative of his name, personal description, duration of his life and reign, and the  children he had. He found also several books treating of the manner of using plants,  minerals, and animals, advantageously for man, besides many wonderful talismans, the work  of ancient philosophers, and another work on the great art,'? and its roots and elixirs ;—all         to Us a V2) 3 Ws dled The word ghaddyira is the plural of ghadir, meaning ‘a tank, a receptacle for stagnant  waters, a lake.’ It has been preserved in the Spanish guadayra or gadayra, as it ought to be pronounced.

"    APPENDIX. xlix    these precious objects, together with an immense quantity of rubies and other coloured  gems, stored in golden and silver urns of beautiful workmanship, and ornamented with large  pearls, were the fruits of Tarik’s conquest.   After penetrating far into the country of the Rim, Tarik returned to Cordova, and fixed  his abode in that city. He is reported to have made war on the infidels until they came up  to him like cattle, and like so many tamed beasts, and until his men were exhausted through  excessive marching, and their bodies dried up through privations and fatigue, when they  unanimously said to him, “ Have we not conquered enough countries, that thou seemest not  “ yet satisfied?” and Térik burst out laughing, and said, “ By Allah! were I to consult my  “ wishes only, I would march with you until we had reached the gates of Rome, or those of  “ Constantinople, and gained possession of those cities, with God’s permission ; but since you  “are tired and weary, you had better return.”   They say that when Misa was made acquainted with these words of T4rik to his men, he  began to be envious of him, and to fear lest the fame of his exploits, and of his praiseworthy  conduct, should reach the ears of Al-walid, and he should rise in favour with the Khalif, and  perhaps be appointed his own superior in command: he therefore hastened to cross the sea  with ten thousand horse, taking with him many illustrious Arabs, in the number of whom were  several tdbi’s, (may God be favourable to them!) such as Hansh Ibn ’Abdillah As-san’éni,  *Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Yezid Al-bajeli, ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Shamésah Al-misri,  Abi-l-nadhar Hayyén™ Ibn Abi Hoblah, a maui of the Beni ’Abdi-d-dar; some add Jebel Ibn  Hasanah and various others, to the number of twenty-five. Musa landed at Algesiras, and  took the road to Cordova; he was met by Tarik, who treated him with respect and sub-  mission, but Musa, raising his staff, gave him a blow on the head, and continued marching until  he reached Cordova.""® Once there, he said to Térik, “ Bring me all the spoil thou hast made,  “ and all the treasures thou hast found,” and Tarik obeyed and brought before him all he had  taken, as well as the table ; but this with only two feet, for the third he had previously taken away  and hidden, foreseeing what would take place. Muisa took possession of all these inestimable  treasures without even thanking Tarik, who was the first to acquire them. As to the table, it  was made of a solid piece of emerald, but, as stated before, it wanted one of the feet!® and  the whole of the border, seeing which, Musa said to him, “ What is the meaning of this?”  and Térik replied, “So I found it,” and Misa believed him, and caused a foot of gold to  be wrought and to be fixed to it instead of the one wanting: he then asked him to deliver into  his hands the fifth of all the spoil taken since his arrival in Andalus, and Térik having also  complied with this demand, Misa became possessed of countless treasures. After this Mtisa         4 Instead of Hayyan I find in the MS. wh Habban, by the omission of one point, but I have no doubt the former was    intended.    4 This passage is very remarkable, since Térik is said to have met his master, Musa, between Cordova and Algesiras,  which is contrary to the statement of all other historians, who assert that the interview took place between the former city  and Toledo.    16 The text only says Uasilye ’ Ue!

After this Muisa left Andalus, taking Tarik with him, and leaving his son ’Abdu-l-’aziz 7  to command in his absence. Arrived in Africa, where he made a short stay, he departed for  Damascus, the court of the prince of the believers, Al-walfd, then the reigning Khalif, taking  with him all the spoil of Andalus, consisting of thirty skins full of gold and silver coin, neck-  laces of inestimable value, pearls, rubies, topazes, and emeralds, besides costly robes of all  sorts; he was followed by eleven hundred prisoners, men, women, and children, of whom four  hundred were princes of the royal blood. Not far from Damascus Miisa was informed how  Al-walid was seriously indisposed and not expected to live, and he received a letter from his  brother and heir, Suleyman, begging him to delay his entry into Damascus until his brother  was dead and himself on the throne, but, instead of complying with his request, Musa  quickened his march, and arrived in Damascus with all his suite before the death of the  Khalif; although, owing to the bad state of his health, Muisa was unable to present to him  his treasures, and Al-walid died without appreciating as they deserved the many curiosities  brought by Musa.   Muisa’s arrival in Africa to take possession of his government is generally fixed in the  month of Jumédi-l-awal of the year seventy-nine (July or August, a. D. 698), he being then  sixty years old. His landing on the coast of Andalus took place in the year ninety-three  (a.p. 712). He left Africa in the year ninety-five, and arrived in Damascus in ninety-six  (A.D. 714-5), after having been for sixteen years at the head of the Moslem armies of Africa  and Spain. Soon after Muisa’s arrival Al-walid died.         APPENDIX E.    Tue MS. which forms the subject of this Appendix is likewise in my possession.

"    APPENDIX. li    the MS., I cannot be very far from the mark when I suppose it to have been written in the ensuing  century. (See Preface.)    The work is entitled SL suall 3 Kole 3! ctyols! ‘traditions of commandment and government,’  or rather, ‘traditional stories relating to supreme commanders and wise rulers,’ and is attributed  to Abi Mohammed ’Abdillah Ibn Moslem Ibn Koteybah Ad-dinawari, a celebrated writer of the third  century of the Hijra. Its contents are a history of the Eastern Khalifa, from Abi Bekr down to  the time of Hérin Ar-rashid (a. 8. 8 to 192). The work is divided into two books of nearly the same  size, the first ending with the death of the Khalif Mu’awiyah Ibn Abi Sufyén; the second with that  of Hardin Ar-rashid. In the first book is introduced a detailed history of Mtisa, and of his conquests in  Africa and Spain, together with a short account of the principal events which occurred in those countries  until their separation from the Eastern empire.   Ibn Koteybah, the supposed author of this book, is well known to have written two works on Eastern  history, one entitled ’Oyinu-t-tawdrtkh (fountains of history); the other, Kitdbu-l-ma'drif ff akhbdri-l-  *arabi wa ansdbihum (the book of information respecting the history and genealogy of the Arabs). Yet,  notwithstanding this circumstance, and that his name is, as usual, written in capital letters at the begin-  ning of the first page, I have strong reasons to suspect that the present work has been falsely attributed to  him. Oriental scholars know too well what little faith can be placed in the titles and names of the authors  of Oriental books, as stated by booksellers, when there is nothing else to corroborate the statement.  Such is the case with the present work. Haji Khalfah, who has preserved us the titles of many of Ibn  Kotevbah’s works, makes not the slightest mention of this. On the other hand, Ibn Khallekén, As-  sadfi, Abi-l-mahésen, all of whom wrote in great detail the life of that author, do not mention the  present among his literary productions. The same might be said of Abzii-l-fed& (An. Mosl, vol. i. p.  330-356, et seg.), Ibn Shihnah, and other historians, who have treated at length on his life and  writings ; and it is hardly credible that an historical work—the production of a writer who is justly  considered as one of the most eminent ornaments of Arabian literature—should have escaped either the  search of the-diligent bibliographer, or the attention of his many biographers and panegyrists.   But there are other circumstances connected with the work which convince me that it was not written  by Ibn Koteybah. Ist. As will be scen in the following extracts, the author, whoever he may be,  repeatedly gives his information as derived from persons who were either the friends or the relations  of people who assisted in the conquest of Spain; and this could not well be the case with Ibn Koteybah,  whose birth took place one hundred and twenty-one years after that memorable event. 2nd. The style  in which the work is written is very different from that of the Adabu-l-kdtib (Arab. MS. in the Brit.  Mus., No. 7464), the Muntekhab fi-l-loghah (Arab. MS., ib., No. 7525), and other productions of the  same author which have passed through my hands. 3rd. Nowhere in the work do the names occur  of Abii Hatim As-scjestani, Suleyman Ibn Abi Bekr Al-ayddi, and other eminent theologians, who,  according to Ibn Khallekaén, (Tyd. Jnd., No. 327,) were the preceptors of Ibn Kotcybah, and the  authors from whom he borrowed his traditions. 4th. Ibn Koteybah was a native of Baghd4d, where he  resided most of his life, while the author of the present work appears, from different passugee,— which  I omit for the sake of brevity,—to have inhabited Damascus.   But if it is easy to prove that the present work is not the production of Ibn Koteybah, it is by no  means so to say who was the author of it. I have curcfully examined all those passages which might  lead to a discovery of the author’s name, but in vain. That he was a native of the East,—perhaps  of Damascus,—where he says he resided,—that he wrote shortly after the death of Hardin Ar-rashid,  which took place in 193 of the Hijra,—are the two only facts which I have been able to establish.  Be this as it may, certain it is that the present work is not only valuable for its great antiquity, but",673,,
"    li APPENDIX.    also for the numerous details it gives upon events which have been treated with great brevity by the  historians of most repute among the Arabs. Seen under this light, the author’s account of Miisa  Ibn Nosseyr, of his conquests in Africa and Spain, of his arrival at Damascus, &c., is really invaluable,  as by means of it, and of other passages which I shall occasionally introduce in my notes, I shall be  enabled to rectify many errors that have crept into the chronology of the Spanish Arabs.   I must end this prefatory notice by stating that the following translation has been executed as literally  as the simple and antiquated style in which the work is written enabled me to do; as, by doing other-  wise, I might have altered the sense, and impaired the highly interesting historical evidence contained in  the work.    Appointment of Misa Ibn Nosseyr.    The author says,—I was told by Yezid Ibn Sa’id, a maulf of Moslem, that the Khalif  *Abdu-l-malek Ibn Merwén wishing to appoint his brother, Besher Ibn Merwén, to the  government of ’Irék, wrote to ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Merwan,? then governor of Egypt, and to  whose care Besher had been intrusted owing to his extreme youth, as follows: “I have  “appointed thy brother Besher to the government of Basrah; let Misa Ibn Nosseyr go  “ along with him and be his Wizir and his counsellor. I have sent thee the military rolls of  “ Trak, give them to Misa, and tell him that all responsibility shall henceforth rest on him.”  Accordingly Besher left Egypt for ’Irék, where he arrived soon after, accompanied by Musa  Ibn Nosseyr. No sooner had he taken possession of his government than he delivered his  seal of office into the hands of Musa, and intrusted him with the entire management of  affairs. In this manner Miisa remained with Besher as long as that youth held the govern-  ment of Basrah.   One day a man entered the room where Besher was, and said to him, “If thou wish,  “ O Governor! I can procure thee a draught that will prevent thy hair from ever turning grey,  “ but thou must first of all agree to a condition.” “ And what is it?” said Besher. ‘Thou  “ must pass forty days,” said the man, “ without either riding a horse, touching a woman,  “ entering a bath, or getting into a passion.” Besher agreed to try the experiment, and,  having promised strictly to comply with the proposed injunctions, the man came to him a  second time, and presented him with the potion, which Besher drank off at one draught. He  then shut himself up in his room, avoiding all society, and shunning the company of his  women and slaves, and went on so until there happened to come a messenger from the  Khalif, who brought him the news of his appointment to the government of Kiifah, which he  was to hold independently of that of Basrah, when Besher’s satisfaction was so complete, and  his joy so extreme, that he immediately ordered horses to ride, and, regardless of the pro-  hibition, prepared to go out of Basrah, and repair immediately to Kuifah. The man of the  draught then came up to him, and entreated him, for God’s sake, not to mount a horse, not to  agitate himself, and not to move from where he was. But Besher, disregarding alike his  entreaties and his advice, and forgetting the instructions given him by the man, persisted in          ""Abdu-l-’aziz, son of the Khalif Merwdn, and brother of ’Abdu-l-malek, his successor in the empire, had been appointed  governor of Egypt and the African conquests in his father’s lifetime.",674,,

When the man saw his  determination, he said to him, “O Besher! take God for witness that thou bearest me  “ innocent of the results,” and Besher promised to do so; and then he mounted his horse  and took with his cavalcade the road to Kiifah. Scarcely had they marched a few miles, when  Besher happening to put his hands on his beard, lo! it all peeled off, and the hairs remained  stuck to his fingers, seeing which, he returned in haste to Basrah, and died soon afterwards.   *Abdu-l-malek having heard of his brother’s death, sent Al-hejaj* Ibn Yusuf to Basrah.  On his arrival in that city, Musa went to meet Al-hejéj, and said to him, “ Here I am, I shall  “ not run away, neither will they.” It must be understood that ’Abdu-l-malek had sent  Al-hejéj to Basrah for the purpose of punishing Musa, with whom he was displeased, for  certain offences received at his hands; but Musa, at the same time, had received a letter from  Khdled Ibn Abbén,‘ who was then at Damascus, saying, “Thy deposition is signed, and  « Al-hej4j has been dispatched with orders to seize on thy person, and inflict upon thee the  “ most severe punishment; so away! away! off with thee, thy safety depends only upon the  “ fleetness of thy horse; if thou succeed in reaching ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Merwan and placing  “ thyself under his protection, all will go well with thee, thou wilt escape from that accursed  “and treacherous man, and be free from his persecutions.” Musa lost no time in delibe-  ration, he mounted his steed and fled to Damascus, where ’Abdu-l-’aziz was then residing,  having just arrived from Egypt with the tribute of that country. In the meanwhile Al-hejaj  wrote from ’Irék, “O Commander of the Faithful! I cannot collect the sums which Misa  “engaged himself to pay every year as the taxation of this province; thy commands are  “ thereby disobeyed. Musa is not to be found in Irak. If he is there, send him to me, that  “ T may deal with him as he deserves, if God be pleased.”    Miisa’s interview with ’Abdu-l-malek.    The author says,—And they relate that ’Abdu-r-rahmaén Ibn Sélim told them, on the  authority of his father, who was Miisa’s friend, and was present at his interview with ’Abdu-l-  malek, that the whole affair passed as follows. These are the words of Sdlim. “ Misa  “ enjoyed great favour with ’Abdu-l~aziz Ibn Merwén, who had already given him so many  “ proofs of it that it would be too long to enumerate them. Immediately on his arrival at  “ Damascus, he went to see his patron, ’Abdu-l-’aziz, and acquainted him with the whole of  “his tale; and Misa himself told me,” continues Sélim, “that it was a most providential  “ favour of heaven that he should then meet ’Abdu-l-’aziz at Damascus, for he received him  “with the greatest kindness, and offered to take him immediately to his brother, the Khalif  “Abdu-l-malek, that he might hear what he had to say in his defence. Musa and his patron  “ then went together to the royal palace, and were immediately introduced to the presence of         3 Al-hej4j was appointed governor of ’Irak in the year seventy-five (A.D. 694).

Musa told me, ‘ When I heard this, I was going to make an angry reply, but  “ *Abdu-l~aziz made me a sign to conform myself to the sentence, however unjust, and I said,  “ Very well, O Commander of the Faithful! thy will must be done; and I left the room.  “?Abdu-l~aziz then came to my assistance with the sum required, and before three months  “ were elapsed I paid down the fifty thousand gold dinars in which I had been fined.’”    Misa’s appointment to the government of Africa.    The author continues.—They relate that when ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Merwén returned to his  government of Egypt, he took along with him Musa, who continued to grow in his good  graces, and became one of his most chosen favourites. Mutisa remained with him until  Hossén Ibn An-no’mdn, who was governor of Eastern Africa, happened to pass through  Egypt on his way to Damascus to present himself to the Khalif, and tell him of his battles  against the Berbers, the victories he had gained over them, and the death of their queen  Kdhinah® (the sorceress), killed in battle. Hossén arrived safely at court, and there saw the  Khalif, who complimented him on his good success, rewarded him munificently, loaded him  with honours and distinctions, granting him the government of Barca to add to his own, and  sent him back to Eastern Africa. On his return thither, Hossan passed through Misr, where  he made some stay, and, leaving orders with the inhabitants to lodge and provide for a portion  of his army, which came at some distance behind him, left that city. Soon after his men  arrived, and when they had been paid and furnished with all necessaries they all marched to  Dhdtu-l-jamdjim/ where they halted. By that time ’Abdu-l-’aziz, the governor of Egypt, had  been informed how Hossdén Ibn An-no’man had asked his brother, the Khalif, for the  government of Barca, and how the Khalif had granted it to him. He immediately dis-  patched a messenger to Hossén, and, arrived into his presence, spoke to him thus: “ Is it  “true that ’Abdu-l-malek has appointed thee governor of Barca?” “It is,” replied         © ined sai I le y  4 wolf Kdhingh is the epithet, not the name, of a certain queen of the Berbers, who fought resolutely against the    Arabs at the time of their invasion of Africa.

"    APPENDIX. lv    Hossén. “ Well, then,” said ’Abdu-l-’aziz, who had previously given the government of that  province to one of his maulis, “thou shalt not take possession of thy office.” “ This is no  “ business of mine,” said Hossén, “the Khalif’s mandate must needs be obeyed.” Upon  which ’Abdu-l~’aziz flew into a passion, and said, “ Bring me thy diploma, that I may examine  “ it, and see if what thou sayest be true.” Hossdn then left the room, and returning soon  after with his diploma, put it into the hands of ’Abdu-l-’aziz, who, having perused it atten-  tively, found it correct. *Abdu-l-’aziz then turned towards Hossén, and said, “ Wilt thou  “ relinquish thy right, and resign thy office?” “Certainly not,” replied Hossan, “ violence  “only will deprive me of an office to which I was appointed by the Commander of the  “ Faithful.” “ Well, then, since thou persistest in thy resolution, I shall deprive thee of both  “ governments, and I shall name in thy stead a man who is much thy superior in talents  “and experience, and God will permit the Commander of the Faithful to reap soon the  “ advantage of my nomination.” Saying which, he tore to pieces the diploma, and, sending  for Misa, invested him with the government of Eastern Africa. This happened on a  Thursday of the month of Safar of the year 79.°   Musa immediately took his departure, having before caused the treasures of the army to be  transported to Dhétu-l-jaméjim, where the troops were already in waiting for them. When  he arrived at the camp, and presented himself before the first division of the army, a sparrow  was observed to come down upon him, and get into his breast. Muisa immediately caught  him, and, asking for a knife, cut the bird’s throat, severing the jugular vein; he then, with  the victim’s blood, besmeared his breast over his clothes; this done, he plucked his feathers,  and scattered them in the air, throwing them over his head. The operation being at an end,  he was heard to exclaim, all filled with enthusiasm, “ Victory! Victory! my friends. By the  “ master of the Ka’bah! victory is ours, if such be the will of the Almighty.”    Miisa’s address to his soldiers.    The author says,—They relate that when Musa reached Dhatu-l-jamajim, the place of  meeting for the troops, the men gathered round him, when, after praising and returning  due thanks to God, he addressed them in the following words: “O men! the Commander of  “the Faithful (may God prosper him!) thought of appointing Hossain Ibn No’man to the  “ command of this frontier, and making him your general. Now man among men is generally  “ qualified by his deeds, and judged by what he does before men, not by what he does behind  “them. When this Hossdn came to see the Amir he not only showed himself: ungrateful  “for the favours he had received, and forgetful of past benefits, but he even went so far as to  “ assert that the command was his own, and that he deserved it, thus effacing by his disrespectful  “behaviour whatever merits he might have formerly possessed. Seeing this, the Amir, who,  “as you well know, is brother and flesh of the Khalif, and whose experience and good  “ judgment is sufficiently tested, has thought fit to depose the said Hossain, and name me in         8 The month of Safar of the year seventy-nine began to be counted on the 9th of April, a.p. 698.",677,,

The author says,—And they relate that Mtisa went on marching towards Eastern Africa? all  the remainder of the month of Safar, all Rabi’ the first, and all Rabi’ the second. He set his  foot in the city of Ifrikiyyah'® on Monday, five days after the beginning (the 5th) of Jumédi  the first of the year 79. The first act of his administration was to seize on Sefayn Ibn  Malik Al-fehri and Abi Séleh, and after fining each of them ten thousand dinars, to send  them in irons to ""Abdu-l-malek. The same author says, Muisa arrived in Ifrikiyyah and the  surrounding country, fearing lest the Moslems encamped in the city should not be able to go  out of their camp, as is customary among them, at their two great annual festivities, owing to  the proximity of the enemy, who surrounded them on every side. Nor was their camp a  very strong or commodious one; the houses of the common people and soldiers were made of  reeds, and those of the officers of the same materials, with the difference only of being of a  conic form, and having a sort of cupola on the top. As to the mosque, it resembled a stable,  only that it had a roof thrown over some beams, and that Hossén Ibn An-no’mén, Muiisa’s  predecessor, had caused the kidlah and the adjoining parts to be built of mud; but the whole  building was, nevertheless, in a ruinous state.         ® The MS. says towards Maghreb (Western Africa), but it is a mistake ; Musa’s government was that of [frikiyyah, or  Africa proper. Western Africa had not yet been entirely subdued.   10 T have said elsewhere (Note 62, book rv. chap. iii.) that the word medinah was formerly used to designate the capital-of  a district or province. Al-bekrf, Idrisf, and most of the African geographers and historians, speak of a city called Medinah  [frikiyyah as being the capital of the province called Ifrikiyyah by the Arabs, and designated by the Latin historians under the  various appellations of Carthaginensis, Byzacena, Marmarica, Cyrene, Zeugitana, and Africa Minor. Marmol (Africa,  tom. ii. fo. 269,) thinks it to be the same as the Adrumento Colonia of Ptolemy. It was destroyed by the Arabs, and rebuilt  by ’Abdullah Mahdi, the first Khalif of the Fétimites or 'Obeydites, who called it Mahdiyyah. See Abi-l-feda, 4. Mosi.  tom. ii. p. 328; Leo Africanus, apud Ramusium, p. 573; Marmol, Africa, tom. ii. fo. 269; and the Geography of Bakuwi,  in the sixth vol. des Not. et Ext. p. 462.",678,,
"    APPENDIX. Wii    Misa’s address to the men on his arrival in Ifrikiyyah.    They relate that when Misa arrived in Ifrikiyyah, and saw the mountains in the neighbour-  hood, and the districts round them, he caused his men to be assembled in the mosque, and,  mounting the pulpit, after praising God, and returning Him thanks, he addressed them thus:  “O men! tell me what sort of a governor was there before me in this city. Was he a man  “ who loved war, or one of those who are fond of peace and tranquillity? Was he generous  “and munificent, or mean and avaricious? Did he speak to you with affability, and salute  “ you with a pleasing countenance, or was he one of those morose men who look as if God  “had tied a knot in their throats, and as if they could not utter one single word? I know  “ well what sort of commander you want; you want one of those warriors who confide  “in their good fortune, who are firm and steady in their purposes, who always do more  “than is expected from them, who consult men of learning and experience in all their un-  “ dertakings, who rely on their experience but are not blinded by their vanity, who are brave,  “and perhaps rash and adventurous, but never cowards; one of those men who become  “ doubly cautious after victory, doubly brave after defeat, who always place their hopes of  “success on no one but God, and who constantly point out to their followers, from among  “the faithful, these encouraging words of their Lord, ‘Success is reserved only for the  “ pious.” Take courage, O men! for if God be on our side he will place our enemies within  “ our reach, and lead us into their strong holds. You may safely rely upon me as your  “commander, for I shall seize every opportunity of leading you on to victory; and, by  “ Allah! I will not cease making incursions into yonder high mountains, and attacking the  “ strong passes leading into them, until God has depressed their elevated summits, reduced  “their strength, and granted the Moslems the victory. I shall lead you on until God  “ Almighty makes us the masters of all or part of the territories lying beyond them, and until  “ we have subdued the countries which his immutable decrees have already allotted us,—for  “ He is the best of decreers.”    How the conquest of Zaghwdén"" came to pass.    The author says,—And they relate that Muisa Ibn Nosseyr made war on certain people from  among the Berbers called ’Arwah,'* who, with one of their great chiefs at their head, were  continually making incursions into the countries already occupied by the Moslems. These  people, who beheld with an evil eye the establishment of the Arabs so close to their territory,  began to make repeated forays beyond their frontiers, and to scour night and day the land  between Zaghwén and Cairwén. Against these Berbers, who were commanded by a chief of  their nation named Warkattéf,'> Musa dispatched one of his bravest officers with a body of  five hundred horsemen. The Moslems met the enemy, and, with the help of the Almighty,         ole; * ie * sli),  VOL. I. L",679,,
"    Wiii APPENDIX.    put them to flight, killing their king Warkattéf, and making ten thousand of them prisoners;  these being the first Berber captives that entered Cairwdn during Misa’s government.   After this, Misa sent in another direction a son of his, named ’Abdullah, who also returned  victorious, bringing with him one hundred thousand captives; he then dispatched to another  quarter Merwdén, another of his sons, who was also successful, and came back with one  hundred thousand captives. Misa himself took a different road, and returned with:a similar  number of prisoners, so that the fifth belonging to the Khalif amounted on this occasion to  sixty thousand captives. God be praised for it! Since His is the empire, and He only is  the mighty conqueror of nations!    How the news of these victories reached ’ Abdu-l’aziz.    The author says,—They relate that Misa Ibn Nosseyr wrote to ’Abdu-l~aziz Ibn Merwén,  who was then at Misr, acquainting him with the victories which God had granted to his arms,  and telling him how he had made so many prisoners that the fifth belonging to the Khalif  amounted to thirty thousand captives, (the writer having written that number by mistake for  sixty thousand.) However, when ’Abdu-l-’aziz perused the letter, he was so astonished that  he sent for his secretary, and said to him, “ By thy soul! read this letter unto me,” and the  secretary did as he was commanded, and said, “O Amir! this is impossible, it must be a  “ mistake of the writer, return the letter that it may be corrected.” And ’Abdu-l-’aziz sent  back the letter to Musa, and wrote with it, “ Thy letter has reached us, and we have perused  its contents, but what thou sayest about the fifth of the spoil gained in the victory that God  “has granted thee being thirty thousand captives seems to us an exaggeration.. We cannot  “help thinking that it must be a mistake of thy secretary; so let us hear the real amount,  © and let the error be corrected.” On the receipt of the Amir’s letter, Misa replied imme-  diately,—* The words of the Amir (may God prosper him!) have come to our hands, as well  “as his suspicion that the number of captives announced may be erroneous. The Amir is  “ right, the secretary made a blunder, for, instead of writing sixty thousand, which is the real  “ number, without any mistake, he put down thirty thousand.” And when Miusa’s answer  reached ’Abdu-l~’aziz, and he had perused its contents, his heart was filled with joy and  satisfaction, and he was greatly astonished by it.    How the Khalif ’ Abdu-l-malek was displeased with Misa’s appointment.    He says,—And they relate that when the Khalif ’Abdu-l-malek heard how ’Abdu-l-’aziz, had  deposed Hossén and appointed Musa in his stead, he not only did not approve of his  brother’s nomination, but was exceedingly angry on account of it, especially as the news of  Musa’s victory had not yet reached him. He therefore thought to himself of removing  Misa, and to that effect sent orders to ’Abdu-l~’aziz, purporting, “The Commander of the  “ Faithful has heard of thy deposing Hossén and naming Misa in his stead, and as he has",680,,
"    APPENDIX. lix    “not been made acquainted with the motives that moved thee to act so,"" he is expecting to  “ hear from thee that on the receipt of the present order thou hast done the same with Misa,  “ for such is the wish of the Commander of the Faithful. Thy sovereign has transmitted to  “ thee his power, and intrusted thee with his authority, for no other purpose than to have his  “ commands punctually executed there. Let Hossén then be restored to his office, for the  “ Commander of the Faithful is very well disposed towards him, and wishes him to be  “ promoted, as he thinks him a very brave, experienced, and fortunate officer.”    The answer of ’Abdu-laztz to his brother ’Abdu-l-malek.    They say,—And when the letter reached ’Abdu-l-’az{z, he wrote the following answer:  “ T have received the letter sent me by the Commander of the Faithful treating about my  “removing Hossén from his government and my nominating Musa in his stead, and also  “ conveying orders for the removal of Miisa and the reinstalment of Hoss4n, saying, ‘that if  “my sovereign has transmitted me his power and intrusted me with his authority, it is in  “ order that his commands be faithfully executed ;’ but, by Allah! I feel certain that the  “ Commander of the Faithful, dazzled by the victories which God granted to Hossén, has  “ formed too high an opinion of him; there are men better qualified than he is for this enter-  “ prise; one of whom is Musa, whose virtues, commendable actions, and good fortune in  “ military affairs, are sufficiently known to me. As to that saying of the Commander of the  “ Faithful, ‘I am waiting to hear of thy having complied with our orders,’ by my life! I also  “am waiting and watching, and I entreat thee to have patience and wait a little longer, when  “ something will occur that will bring on me the thanks of the Commander of the Faithful,  “ and his praises for my good choice and honest intentions.—Fare thee well.”    ?Abdu-l’aziz acquaints his brother ’Abdu-l-malek with Miisa’s victories.    The author of the tradition says,—And they relate that ’Abdu-l-’aziz wrote to his brother,  *Abdu-l-malek, the following letter: “ O Commander of the Faithful! thy conduct and mine  “ in this affair of Hossdén and Misa very much resembles that of the two men who laid down  “a wager as to who had the fleetest horse; they therefore let their horses go to a given  « distance, which both traversed, arriving at the end of it together, when, upon measurement,  “it was found that one of them had traversed a longer distance.'® Yes, if God be pleased,         44 The original says ws a 5c os Sl pl r= ; “and he knows the reason why thou hast deposed him;’ but I  think that the negative particle ¥ has been omitted.   © [am not sure that I have seized the right meaning of the allusion, which reads thus in the text: Ly ,)! eS) AILS  jo adic GL y Lrdod Xl code , ne Lie LES Lule po Laws I presume, however,  that what the author means is this, “ that both Hossén and Misa would fulfil well the duties of their charge, but that Masa    “ would surpass Hoss4n in the same manner as the horse, which, notwithstanding he reached the mark at'the same time as  “ his competitor in the race, had traversed a longer distance.”    4",681,,
"    Ix APPENDIX.    “ the excess this time shall be in thy favour. I have just received from Misa the letter  “ which I enclose, that thou mayest peruse it, and praise God for it.”    ?Abdu-l-malek’s answer.    The author of the tradition says,—The following was the answer sent by ’Abdu-l-malek to  his brother’s letter: “The Commander of the Faithful has received thy letter, and understood  “ its meaning. He has likewise penetrated the sense of the comparison thou madest of him  “in the affair between Hossén and Misa, and thy saying that one of the two horses certainly  “ surpassed the other, and that the Khalif will reap the benefit of it. The Commander of the  “ Faithful says, that thou hast at last gained thy purpose in making Muisa governor, but of  “this he is certain, that whoever acknowledges the true God is sure of prosperity and  “victory at his hands, and all those who have experienced privations are glad.—Fare  “thee well.” After this, ’Abdu-l-’aziz sent a messenger with the Khalif’s letter to Musa,  that he might read and see what ’Abdu-l-malek said about him. According to Misa’s own  account, a messenger brought him the above letter, besides another from ’Abdu-l~’aziz  himself, and when the messenger reached Misa he presented him the passage to read.    Misa’s conquests in the territories of Hawdrah, Zendtah, and Kotdmah.'*    He says,—And they relate that Musa sent ’Ayydsh Ibn Akhyal’” with one thousand  horsemen against the tribes of Hawérah and Zenétah. ’Ayydsh made incursions into their  territory, and killed numbers of them; he took, besides, five thousand captives, among whom  was the chief of the Hawarah tribe, named Kémin.'* This Berber, together with other  illustrious captives of the same tribe, Musa sent to ’Abdu-l-’aziz. Kamin, moreover, was  executed near a tank close to the village of ?Okbah, which has ever since been known by the  name of the sufferer, Berkah Kémiin (the tank of Kémiin). After this, ""Ayydésh made a  second irruption into their territory, but this time they all came before him and asked for  peace, and ’Ayy4sh sent their principal men to Mutisa, who granted them terms. It hap-  pened about this time that the tribe of Kotémah sent messengers to Musa asking him for  peace; this the Moslem general readily granted, taking hostages from among their best  families, and appointing one of them to command the whole tribe. However, some time  afterwards, the people of Kotémah killed the chief appointed by Musa, and one of the tribe  wrote to Misa, “ We are certainly thy slaves; one of us having killed our king, we are now  “ without a ruler; be pleased to appoint another: I can answer thy purpose much better than  “ the last, and supply his place.” When Misa received this message, he doubted not but that         © ee  wR LES 8.

See Al-bekri, Memdlek wa-l-mesdlek, fo. 58.",682,,
"    APPENDIX. xi    the Kotémah were inclined to rebellion: he was further confirmed in his suspicions by the  fact that only a few days before this event the hostages of the tribe of Zendtah had asked  his leave to absent themselves for one day from the camp to attend a hunting expedition,  and the permission had been granted them; but when the news reached Misa of the  assassination of their chief, he doubted not but that his hostages had fled on account of it, as  a preconcerted plan before their rebellion. He accordingly sent a body of cavalry in pursuit  of them, and the fugitives having been all caught and brought back to his presence, he  ordered that they should be immediately crucified. But they said to him, “ Do not be too  “hasty, O Amir! in having this thy sentence carried into execution. Delay it, for fear thou  “ shouldst find out afterwards that our fathers and relations never dreamt of rebelling. We  “ are in thy hands, and in thy power, and no one can better than thyself ascertain if the crime  “be a real or supposed one. Shouldst thou put us to death, and we be innocent, thou couldst  “not restore us to life.’ These reasons prevailed; Muisa suspended the sentence, and  having put them in irons, made them march before him towards the territory of Kotémah,  where no sooner were they arrived than the elders of the tribe, who heard of his approach,  came out to him and made their excuses. Musa accepted them, and being convinced of  their innocence, spared the lives of the hostages, and ordered them to be released.    Subjugation of the tribe of Senhdjah.    The author says,—And they relate that the scouts came one day to Mtisa Ibn Nosseyr and  told him how the tribe-of Senhdéjah was unaware of them, and unprovided, and how their  camels had just brought forth and could not stir. Muisa, accordingly, made an invasion into  their territory at the head of four thousand men of the regular army, and two thousand  volunteers and Berbers, leaving behind ’Ayy4sh, with two thousand horsemen, to guard the  baggage and families of the Moslems at Tobnah.'® He himself went on with his army,  giving the command of the van to Misa Ibn *Iyédh® Ibn *Okbah; the right wing to  Al-mugheyrah Ibn Abi Burdah, and the left to Zor’ah Ibn Abi Mudrik; and marched until  he fell unawares upon the Senhdjah, and such other among the Berber tribes as were with  them at the time. Muisa fought with them the battles of extermination ; he killed myriads of  them, and made a surprising number of prisoners, since on this occasion only they amounted  to one hundred thousand men, to say nothing of the camels, cows, sheep, horses, mules, grain,  and articles of dress, for their numbers exceeded all computation. After this, Musa and his  men returned with their prey to Cairwan ;?' all these forays taking place within the year eighty  (A.D. 699-700). And when the soldiers of distant countries inhabited by the Moslems heard  of the success which God had granted to Misa’s arms, and the immense spoil collected by the         The text says dail Tanbah, but Tobnah is no doubt intended.

After this, Al-mugheyrah  had several very sharp encounters with the Senhdjah, but God was pleased to permit that he  should rout them every where,” and put them to flight, the number of captives taken in this  expedition amounting to sixty thousand. Al-mugheyrah then returned.    The taking of Sejimd,* and how it happened.    He says,—And they relate that in the year 83, Najdah Ibn Musa came and joined Musa  Ibn Nosseyr with the van of the Egyptian army, upon which that general commanded his  men to get themselves ready to make war against the infidel tribes. He then sent Yezid  against Sejimé and the surrounding country, and, leaving his son ’Abdullah Ibn Miisa to  command in his stead at Cairwan, he himself went out at the head of ten thousand Moslems.  *Iyédh Ibn ’Okbah led the van, Zor’ah Ibn Abi Mudrik Ar-ro’ayni had the command of the  right wing, Al-mugheyrah Ibn Abi Burdah Al-korashi that of the left, the rear remaining  under charge of Najdah Ibn Muksim Ibn Najdah.** Musa, moreover, having intrusted to his  son Merwan Ibn Mtisa the keeping of the banners, marched until he reached a spot known  by the name of Shajaru-l-molik (the tree of the kings), whence, leaving behind all the heavy  baggage under the orders of ?Omar Ibn Oways*® with a body of one thousand horsemen, he  proceeded with the rest until he reached a river called Mulwiyah,* which he found much  swollen by the rains. Not choosing to remain long on its banks, for fear the provisions of  his army should be exhausted, and that if the enemy knew where he was encamped they  would attack him, he looked for and found a ford,—not the ford of ?Okbah Ibn Na&fi’, for  this he would not use,—and passed the river by it. When Musa saw himself safe on the  other side, he marched against the enemy, whom he found on the alert and prepared for war.  He then attacked them, and fought with them great battles near a mountain chain, to which  there was no approach but through certain passes or gorges. There the armies were engaged  all Thursday until night, and all Saturday until the hour of evening prayers. One of the  Berber chiefs then came out before the ranks of the Moslems, and stood for some time  challenging any of them to come out and fight him. None, however, came out, which being  . observed by Musa, he turned towards his son Merwan, and said to him, “O my son! go out         2 The author uses here an expression which is almost untranslatable, re us en 3 * he granted him their shoulders,’  that is, ‘ he granted to him to see their shoulders in the fight.’    bad legs which I find in Ibnu Khaldtin and Al-bekri written Le gAiins and Le yas appears to be the Segeme of  Marmol, Descrip. de Afr. vol. ii. fo. 72.    us ce roe) posse es! $d?

Merwan was then  very young, and had scarcely attained the age of manhood, so that when the Berber saw him  he laughed with scorn, and said, “ Return to the camp, for I am unwilling to deprive thy old  “ father of so comely a youth as thou art.” Merwdn, however, without saying a word, attacked  the infidel, who retreated and swiftly mounted his horse. Once on the saddle, the Berber  rushed against his antagonist, and dealt him a furious blow with his javelin; this Merwan  parried by seizing the Berber’s weapon with his hand ; he then rushed on his adversary, and  ran him through with his javelin. So fierce was the blow that the weapon went first through  the Berber’s side and then sunk deep into the flanks of his steed, both the rider and his  charger falling dead to the ground. The two armies then came to an engagement, and a most  desperate battle was fought, which caused all previous battles to be forgotten: at last, God  was pleased to put the infidels to flight, and grant a complete victory to the Moslems; the  King of the Berbers, whose name was Kuseylah,” remaining dead on the field of battle.  Innumerable maidens, inestimable by their beauty and accomplishments, and the daughters of  the kings and chiefs, were on this occasion the prize of the victors. When the spoils gained  in this battle were to be divided, Muisa caused the daughters of the kings to stand before him,  and having sent for his son Merwan, he said to him, “ Come, O my son! come and choose  “ among these maidens.” And Merwan chose among them one that was the daughter of their  late king, Kuseylah, and who became afterwards the mother of two sons by Merwén,—  *Abdu-l-malek® and Misa.   About this time Zor’ah Ibn Abf Mudrik had an engagement with the Berbers, in which he  had the worst, for he was defeated, and severely wounded besides in the thigh. When Misa  was informed of it he caused him to be borne on the shoulders of his own men, and carried to  Cairwan, fifty men relieving one another in turn every day. After this, Muisa also returned  to Cairwén, but not without having previously subdued the whole of that country. He then  began to write to ’Abdu-l-’aziz, announcing to him conquest after conquest,” like the         37 This chief, whom Ibnu Khaldin (loco laudato, fo. 49, verso,) calls f , w SuuS Kuseylah Ibn Leram, and Al-bekri  eee 2    (fo. 59) pd we?

His son, ’Ali Ibn Yusuf, continued the  building, and surrounded it with a stone wall. It was increased hy his successors, but not completed until the reign  of the Sultén Abd Yusuf Ya’kdb, the grandson of ’Abdu-l-mumen, in the year five hundred and eighty-five (a. p. 1189-90),  when it became the capital of Africa, and the residence of the Almohades.

It is further said  that whenever ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Merwén received, through ’Abdu-l’aziz, news of Miisa’s  conquests, he used to say, “ Victory has rendered thee vain, O Abi-l-asbagh !” *— after this  he added, “but the time is not distant when they will oppose those very things which are  © best for them.”   He says,—And Misa sent a messenger to *Lyédh, ?Othman, and Abi ’Obeydah, all three  sons of ’Okbah, and said to them, “Go and revenge yourselves by putting to the sword the  “ murderers of your father ?Okbah.”*! Accordingly, ""Iyédh departed, and slew six hundred  of their best and principal men. After which, Musa sent him a message telling him to stop;  *Iyédh did as he was desired, though not without exclaiming, when he received the order,  “ By Allah! Hadst thou left me alone, I would not have stopped as long as there was one of  “ them remaining.” .    Arrival of the news of this victory to ’Abdu-l’aztz Ibn Merwdn.    The author says,—And they relate that when Musa heard of the victory gained by *Iyadh,  he immediately sent a messenger to acquaint ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Merwan with it. The mes-  senger, whose name was ’Ali Ibn Rabéh,* marched until he arrived in Egypt, and presented  himself to ’Abdu-l-’aziz, who treated him kindly, and rewarded him munificently. He then  sent him with the news to ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Merwén, who, on his arrival, also rewarded  him, and added to his other gifts twenty thousand pieces.** On the return of ’Ali Ibn Rabah         preceding note, p. 349, and patanae informs us that the spot where that splendid city was built was from time    es  immemorial known as the oss | r os ‘plain of Morrékosh,’ and was in the hands of the Berber tribe of  Masmidah, from whom the grand was purchased by Yusuf. It is therefore probable that the author alludes here to some  town called Morrékosh which stood there in Musa’s time.   I ought to observe, that not having hitherto met with this word pointed as above, I have in two or three instances in this  translation written the name of that town in the usual way (Marrekash), which I now find to be a mistake. Not only is  that word pointed in my MS., but by referring to Ibnu Khaldin, the author of the Karftds, and the history of Africa  attributed to Ibn Battdttah, I find it constantly written and pointed in the same manner; nay, Ibnu Khaldin (loco laudato,  fo. 44, verso,) says that Morrékosh is a compound of two Berber words, meaning ‘ pass by quickly,’ owing to the spot being  infested by robbers and wild beasts.

"    APPENDIX. lxv    to Egypt, ’Abdu-l-’aziz asked him, “ How much did the Commander of the Faithful give  “thee?” “Twenty thousand pieces,” replied Ali. ’Abdu-l-’aziz then said, “ Were it not  “ that I dislike to imitate his example, I would give thee a similar sum; however, I shall add  “ to it ten thousand pieces,”—and he did so. As to ’Abdu-l-malek, he wrote to apprise Musa  how he had granted him a pension™ of two hundred pieces from his treasury, and another of  one hundred for each of his sons; how he had likewise decreed that five hundred men chosen  from among his freedmen and soldiers who had behaved best, or received wounds on the  field of battle, should be remunerated with thirty pieces each.** He at the same time wrote  to him, saying, “ As to thyself, the Commander of the Faithful grants thee the one hundred  “ thousand pieces paid by thee some time ago into his treasury as the amount of thy fine.®  “ Thou mayest deduct it from the Khalif’s share in the spoil, and take it for thyself.” When  the letter of ’Abdu-l-malek reached Misa, he said, in the presence of his men, “I take you  “all to witness that this sum shall be spent entirely in the promotion of religion and the  “ good of the Moslems ;” and so he did, for whenever after a victory there was a number of  slaves put up for sale, he used to buy all those whom he thought would willingly embrace  Islam, who were of noble origin, and who looked, besides, as if they were active young men.  To these he first proposed the embracing of Islim, and if, after cleansing their understanding  and making them fit to receive its sublime truths, they were converted to the best of religions,  and their conversion was a sincere one, he then would, by way of putting their abilities to  trial, employ them. If they evinced good disposition and talents he would instantly grant  them liberty, appoint them to high commands in his army, and promote them according to  their merits; if, on the contrary, they showed no aptitude for their appointments, he would  send them back to the common depdt of captives belonging to the army, to be again disposed  of according to the general custom of drawing out the spoil by arrows.   And they say that Musa wrote to ’Abdu-l~’aziz, telling him of the wound of Abu Zar’ah  Ibn Abi Mudrik, and how much he had suffered, and that, had it not been for his accident,  he would have sent him as a messenger to the Khalif instead of Ibn Rabéh. In reply to this  letter ’Abdu-l-’aziz sent him a provision of one hundred pieces for Abi Zar’ah, and other  pensions in proportion for thirty of his best men. After this Mtisa returned with his army  to Cairwan.    Incursions at sea, and how they came to pass.    The author says,—And they relate that Musa stayed at Cairwan the remainder of the month  of Ramadhan, and all the month of Shawwél, after which he ordered the building of a dock-  yard at Tiinis, and declared his intention of sailing thither in person. Having accordingly  put to sea, he entered the port of that city soon after.

I am one hundred and twenty-one  “ years old, and I remember well hearing my father say that when the Lord of Kartéjénah  * (Carthage) thought of building his city, the people came up to him wondering, and repre-  sented to him the difficulties of the undertaking; but one of them rose, and said to him, ‘O  “ King! if thou put thy hand to this work thy wishes shall be fulfilled, for the kings, thy  “ predecessors, left no undertaking unachieved, whatever its magnitude or difficulty might be.’  “ And I now say unto thee what was said to the King of Carthage, put thy hand to this  “ work, which is certainly not greater than those achieved by them, and God will help  “ thee.’ When Misa heard this he was highly delighted, and wondered much at the old  man’s words. He immediately issued orders for the building of the dock-yard, and having  heard of its being finished, he put to sea, and, after sailing twelve miles, entered it. From  that moment the port of Tiinis became a place of safety for ships when winds blew at sea  and the waves were high. He then ordered the building of one hundred vessels, and passed  in these preparations the remainder of the year eighty-four (beginning Jan. 23, a.p. 703).   About this time ’Atté Ibn R4fi’ Al-hudhelf, with the Egyptian fleet, arrived in Eastern  Africa. He came, sent by ’Abdu-l’aziz, with instructions to make a descent on the coast of  Sardéniyyah (Sardinia), and he entered the port of Sisah. No sooner was Miisa informed of  his arrival than he sent him provisions for his crew, and wrote to him, saying, “The season  “ for navigating the sea is gone by for this year. Remain where thou art, and do not expose  “ thyself and thy men to certain perdition. Think that the men under thy orders have  “ fathers and sons. Wait until the fine weather returns.” But ’Att4 raised his head with  contempt at Miisa’s letter, and shut his ears to his advice; he fitted his vessels, and weighing  anchor, imprudently put to sea, They first came to an island called Salsalah,” which they  conquered, making considerable spoil, and taking a variety of valuable things, such as gold,  silver, and precious stones; but, as ’Atté and his men were returning from this expedition, a  terrific storm arose at sea, all their vessels were dashed against the shores of Eastern Africa,  and ’Atté and nearly all his men were drowned. When the intelligence of this disaster  reached Muisa, he dispatched his son ’Abdu-l-’aziz with a body of cavalry towards the shore,  to see what could be saved from the wreck of ’Atta’s fleet. Arrived on the spot, ’Abdu-l~’aziz  found a heavy box, which, when opened, proved to contain the share of the spoils of Yezid  Ibn Masréf. After this, the author of the tradition says,—I one day found an old man sitting  on the sea shore with a reed in his hand; I went up to him, and tried to take it, but he  disputed possession with me; at last, I wrested it from him, and struck his head with it, and  when the reed broke, lo! pearls, precious stones, and dinérs fell out of it.   After this Miisa ordered that all the vessels and crews saved from the storm should enter         3% gui, This must be the island of Linosa or that of Lampedusa, between Malta and the eastern coast of Africa.

When it was the year eighty-five  (beginning Jan. 12, 704), he issued orders for all the men to prepare for sea, announcing that  he himself would embark and accompany the expedition. This intelligence increased the  ardour of the troops, and they all hastened to embark; the vessels were stored, and every  thing got ready, and there was not a noble Arab, among those who were in Miisa’s army, who  did not embark on this occasion, so that there only remained on shore a few men to repel a  sudden attack of the enemy. However, Musa did not go on board as he had promised to do,  but having given the command of these naval forces to his son ’Abdullah, he ordered  him to weigh anchor immediately. Musa’s intention, as it was afterwards divulged, had  been to send all his best men with the fleet. Accordingly, all the soldiers known for their  courage and resolution, and all the noble Arabs who were with Musa, embarked for this  expedition, which, owing to this circumstance, was afterwards called “the expedition of the  nobles,” (Ghazawatu-sh-shorafd.)   However, Abdullah put to sea with his fleet, this being the first maritime expedition which  had put off from the shores of Eastern Africa since its invasion by the Moslems. They  arrived in sight of the island of Sicily,*? and landed to the west of it, entering a city there in  which they found so much spoil that each man on board received one hundred dinérs of gold  for his share, although the Moslems were between nine hundred and one thousand in  number. After this the fleet returned safe to Africa.   About this time news came to Musa of the death of his patron, ’Abdu-l-’aziz, son of  Merwén, and soon after of that of the Commander of the Faithful, ’Abdu-l-malek, son of  Merwdn, who was succeeded in the Khalifate by his son, Al-walfd Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, in the  year eighty-six (beginning Jan. 1, 705). On receiving this intelligence, Muisa sent a mes-  senger to court to take the oath of allegiance in his name, and to acquaint the Khalif with the  victory gained by his son ’Abdullah, and the spoil made by the Moslems.   In the meanwhile Zor’ah Ibn Abi Mudrik was dispatched by Muisa against the Berber  tribes, but he had no opportunity of coming to an engagement with them, for no sooner had  he arrived in their territory, than they all came before him and sued for peace. Seeing  which, Zor’ah sent the principal among them to Muisa, who, taking hostages from each tribe,  granted their request. Muisa then gave to Ibn Akhyal the command of the fleet of Eastern  Africa, with instructions to put to sea and invade some of the enemy’s islands. In com-  pliance with these orders that general passed the winter on the sea, and attacked a city  called Sirakvisa, whence he returned safe in the same year (a.H. 86). Three years after-  wards (a.H. 89), Abdullah Ibn Marrah, having arrived with a body of men from Egypt,  presented himself to Misa, who gave him the command of the sea. *Abdullah landed on  the island of Sardinia, and entered its cities, where he gained so much spoil that each  man’s share amounted to three thousand prisoners, exclusive of the gold, silver, &c.; so that  all present received abundantly.         » Nuwayri speaks of two expeditions; one commanded by ’Abdullah Ibn Kays Al-fezdri, the other by Mohammed Ibn  Idris Al-ansér{, both of which sailed from Africa to Sicily long before the time here assigned.

"    Ixviii 7 APPENDIX.    Expedition to Siis-al-aksd.    The author continues :—They relate that Mtisa Ibn Nosseyr sent his son Merwén to  Stis-al-aksaé, a country which was at that time under the rule of Al-audi. Merwan marched  with five thousand men of those inscribed on the rolls of the army. The recorder of this  tradition says,—“ The troops were already assembled, and the men prepared for battle, when  “ Merwan saw the enemy waiting to receive them, with the spear in the right hand and the  “ shield in the left, and pointing with their hands towards his men as if they were inquiring  “ ¢ How many are ye?’ However, Merwan and his men met the Marz4yah,""' and fought  “valiantly with them. The Marzdyah were defeated, and God granted their shoulders to  “the Moslems, who slaughtered among them the slaughter of extermination. This expe-  “dition to Sis was afterwards the cause of all the tribes in that country coming before  “ Merwéan, and putting themselves under his orders. The prisoners taken on this occasion  “ amounted to forty thousand. After this Mtisa gave the command of the African sea to his  “son ’Abdullah. This general scoured the seas, made a descent on the island of Mallorca,  “ and conquered it.”    How and when the news of these victories was brought to Al-walid.    They relate that a servant of Al-walid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek told them, “I was close to the  “ Khalif, who was performing his ablutions in a vessel of gold that was before him, when in  “ came a messenger from Koteybah Ibn Moslem, announcing the conquest of some districts  “in Khorassan. I went to Al-walid and told him of his arrival, and the Khalif commanded  « me to take the letter from him and read it to him; I did so, but before I had come to the  © end of it, in came another messenger from Musa Ibn Nosseyr with the news of the conquest  “ of Stis-al-aksa, by his son Merwén. I told the Khalif of it, and was likewise ordered to  “bring in the letter and read it to him. I obeyed, and my master then praised God, and  “ returned thanks, and went upon his knees and prayed. Scarcely, however, had I ended the  “letter, when another messenger, also from Musa Ibn Nosseyr, made his appearance, and  “ having informed the Khalif of his arrival, I brought the message in as I had done with the  “ others, and read it to Al-walfd, who praised and thanked God for it, and fell upon his knees,  “ worshipping and praying. This being done, the Khalif turned towards me, and said,  “ Stand outside by that door, and do not let any one come in.’ There was at the time in  “ the room a young infant, a son of Al-walid, who was crawling on the floor, and who, while  “ his father was absorbed in his prayers and returning thanks to the Almighty for the favours  “ received, approached the vessel, and fell inside of it. The child being hurt by the fall,  “ screamed out for help, but, although I saw his danger, I could not run to his assistance,         « uses 3) may be the name of the tribe, as well as that of the king ruling in those districts.    8 wot Ds ll Jus) a) 550 ; wy; oo (As Thus in the text.",690,,

They say,—After this the Lord of the castle of Auséf made a foray into some district of  Eastern Africa, and gained some advantage over the Moslems. This having reached the ears  of Musa, he went out against him in person, but could not overtake him; upon which Misa  was sadly vexed, and exclaimed, “ May God Almighty kill me if I do not kill the infidel as  “soon as an opportunity is offered me.” Accordingly, after some time, Muisa sent for one of  his men, and addressed him thus: “I have sent for thee to give thee orders which must  “ needs be executed ; if thou fulfil them, ample shall be thy reward. Take these two parcels,”  “and march until thou art arrived at such a spot in such a country, where thou wilt find a  “temple, and the Rim worshipping in it. Approach the temple by stealth, and when night  “ comes leave one of these parcels, and then return to me.” Misa had previously directed  that in both the parcels should be placed silks, brocades, and other novelties and valuable  articles from Arabia, together with a letter in the Rumi language, purporting to be an answer  to the governor, as if he had written to Miisa suing him for peace, and offering in return to  lead him into the country of the Rim, and deliver into his hands their strong places. There  was, besides, in the parcel a safe conduct of Musa for the governor. The commission was  faithfully executed ; the man travelled to the place described to him, approached the temple  at night, and leaving one of the two parcels‘ with its contents, returned, as he had been told,  with the other to the place where Musa was. When the Rim came out of the temple and  found the parcel they were very much surprised, but, not knowing whence it came, nor who had  left it there, they apprised the Batrik (Patrician), who was governor of the district, of the case.  The governor opened the parcel, and examined the contents, but, seeing the presents and the  letter inside, he was so terrified that he immediately sent a messenger with the whole to his  superior, the king of the country. The king read the letters, together with the safe conduct,  and, not doubting that the governor of Ausaf was a traitor, secretly dispatched a man to the  castle with orders to take the command of it and put the governor to death. The king’s  commands were punctually executed; the man who had made the incursion into Eastern  Africa was beheaded, and Misa revenged. ‘         wo ell en dS The word yo! which I have ventured to render by ‘ parcels,’ must have had in ancient  times a meaning which it has not at present. .4dhen means ‘an ear,’ perhaps the name was also applied to some sort of  travelling bags having that shape,—but this is a conjecture for which I cannot give the least authority.    i pl wo!

The blessing of God and salutation  be on our Lord and Prophet Mohammed, and on his family and companions! After this  Misa sent his freedman Tarik against Tangiers and the neighbouring districts. Térik  accordingly marched thither, and took the cities and the castles of the Berbers. This being  done, Térik wrote to his master, Miisa, “I have found here six vessels ;” and Misa answered  him, “Try to make them seven, and when the number is completed, take them to the sea  “ shore, and fill them with men and provisions; thou wilt then look for a man acquainted  “with the months of the Syrians, and when the twenty-first day of the Syrian month called  “ Adar“ has come, put to sea with thy men, after imploring the favours of the Almighty.  “When at sea, thou must pursue thy course until thou seest before thee a small mountain  “ deprived of vegetation, and of a reddish hue, having on one of its sides a fountain running  “ towards the east, and by the side of the fountain a building with an idol at the top in the  “ shape of a bull. Thou must first break the idol to pieces, and then thou wilt look among thy  “ men for a tall man having red hair and a white complexion, with a cast in one of his eyes“  “and a mole on his hand; give that man the command of the van, and remain wherever  “ thou mayest be at the time, waiting for further instructions from me, if God be pleased.”   They say that when Térik received the above orders from Musa, he answered him thus:  “ T have scrupulously fulfilled thy orders, but respecting the man thou didst describe to me, I  “ can nowhere find one of his description, except in my own person.” Accordingly, Térik set  out on his expedition with seventeen hundred men in the month of Rejeb of the year 92.  Ludherik, being at that time engaged in making war on some enemies of his called Bashkans  (Basques), had appointed one of his nobles, named Tudmir, to command and rule the  kingdom in his room. When Tudmfr, therefore, heard of the landing of Térik and his  followers on the coast of Andalus, he wrote immediately to Ludherik, his master, telling him  to hasten to meet the enemy. This Ludherik did at the head of ninety thousand cavalry,  bringing all his treasures and riches in waggons; he himself came borne on a litter placed  between two mules, and having over his head a vaulted canopy richly set with pearls, rubies,  and emeralds; he brought also with him ropes to tie the hands of the captives, for he doubted  not but that he should take every one of the Moslems prisoners.   When Térik heard of the arrival of Ludherik with his formidable host, he praised and  exalted God ; he then called together his men, and urged them to fight for religion and the  cause of God, setting before them the advantages of martyrdom, and strengthening their  hopes in the Almighty. He then exclaimed, “O ye men! Whither can ye fly? the sea is  “at your backs; the enemy in front of you: by Allah! there is no salvation for you but in  “ courage and perseverance,—two virtues that never were defeated, and which are like two         « jie!

Ixxi    “ victorious armies; with them small numbers cannot but succeed, while a multitude without  “them is of no avail, especially to men, like those now before you, oppressed by tyranny,   enervated by luxury, weakened by discord, and stained by cowardice and vanity. O ye  “ men! imitate my example, and whatever ye see me do, do it also; if I charge, charge; if  “1 stop, stop. Let all your movements be uniform, as if you were only one man. For my  “ part, I intend to make for the tyrant, and shall not desist from my intention, nor deviate  “ from my course, until I reach the spot where he is, or die in the attempt. If I should be  “ killed, let not fear enter your hearts, or the want of a commander throw confusion into your  “ ranks; for if once you are overpowered by terror, if the gales of victory cease to blow for  you, if you turn your backs on the enemy, you may all count yourselves either slain or  “ prisoners. If you have, therefore, any attachment to this world, do not throw away with  “ your own hands the splendid opportunity now offering itself of gaining numberless treasures  “ to spend them hereafter in a life of luxury and comfort, or of gaining a still greater reward,  « —the bright crowns of martyrdom,—for if ye do, (which God forbid!) your names will be  “ hereafter coupled with infamy and shame, and will only be matter of derision and contempt  “to your friends the Moslems. Follow me, O men! I shall not stop until I reach the  “ tyrant in the middle of his steel-clad warriors.” Having said this, Tarik charged, and his  men charged also; they mixed with the infidels, and a most desperate battle ensued. Tarik  kept his word, he penetrated to the spot where the tyrant was, and killed him with his own  hand. Ludherik’s followers were then disheartened and dispersed, and the rout became  general. After this Térik took Ludherik’s head and sent it to his master, Musa, who  dispatched one of his sons with it to the Khalif Al-walid. Musa sent, along with his son,  some of the principal inhabitants of Ifrikiyyah, and they all reached safely the court of the  Khalif, who was highly delighted to hear the news of the victory, honoured and distinguished  Miisa’s son much, and rewarded every one of those who came with him. After this Al-walfd  dismissed the messengers, who returned to Misa.   It has been said that, after the defeat of Ludherik, the Moslems found on the field of  battle so many riches belonging to him or to the nobles who were with him, that the  calculation of their amount was almost impossible, and that on this occasion all the Moslems  were guilty of fraud and rapine, except Abu ’Abdi-r-rahmén Al-jiyali. However, some time  after this event Térik wrote to his master, “People are coming against us from every  “ province of this kingdom. Help! help!” No sooner did Musa receive this letter than he  called together his men, and assembled a numerous army, intending to cross over to Andalus  in the month of Safar of the year ninety-three (Nov. or Dec. a.p. 711). The departure  was fixed for a Thursday (of the said month) at dawn of day, so that, leaving his son  *Abdullah to command in his name in Eastern Africa, as well as in Tangiers and Siis, he  wrote to his son Merwén, who was occupied in the back settlements, to come and join him  with his army, which he did. Thus reinforced, Misa took his departure on the appointed  day, and, crossing over to Andalus, met his freedman Térik, whose army he found reinforced  by numbers of adventurers who had already joined him from all countries. He then marched  until he entered, as a conqueror,“ the mighty city of Cordova, and the towns, castles, and    “ The word Fad ‘to open,’ means generally ‘to enter a town by force of arms;’ but as Cordova and the neighbouring",693,,
"    Ixxii APPENDIX.    fortresses in its neighbourhood. They say that most of the Moslems were on this occasion  guilty of much excess, defrauding their comrades of their share in the spoil by hiding what  they took themselves; the only man who behaved well was Abii *Abdi-r-rahmén Al-jiyali.  After this Muisa marched through the country, doing nothing else on his route but subduing  cities and towns right and left, until he came to the city of the Kings of Toledo, where he  found a palace called Beytu-l-molik (the mansion of the kings), so named from the circum-  stance of twenty-four gold diadems, one for each of the kings who had reigned over Andalus,  being found in it. Each diadem had an inscription bearing the name of the king to whom it  had belonged, and stating the number of children the king had left, the days of his birth,  accession to the throne, and death; for it was a custom among the Gothic sovereigns of Andalus  that the diadem worn by each of them during his life should, after his death, be deposited in  that mansion. Besides these treasures Musa found in the same palace a table, on which was  the name of Suleymén, son of Daéid, (on whom be peace!) and another table of onyx. When  Miisa saw these things, he immediately placed them under the custody of trustees‘? appointed  by him, and concealed them from the eyes of his followers, since such was the value of these  and other precious objects found at the time of the invasion of Andalus by the Moslems, that  there was not a single man in the army who could, even approximatively, fix a value on them;  and as to the silver, the gold, the silks, the brocades, and.other articles of apparel or farniture,  no man, however learned, could ever arrive at a computation.    Al-walid meditates the removal of Misa.    They relate that when the Khalif Al-walid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek heard of Miisa’s departure  - for Andalus, and was informed of the nature and extent of that country, suspicion entered his  mind that Misa might make himself independent, and resist his authority. In this belief he  was confirmed by the opinion of his courtiers, as well as by the delay experienced in receiving  news from Andalus, since Misa, occupied as he was in the subjugation of the country and  the entire reduction of the enemy, had no leisure to write to acquaint him with his progress.  Al-walid’s fears grew so strong at last, that one day, being at the mosque, he commanded the  Kadi, after prayers, to implore the Almighty that he would defeat Musa’s ambitious projects.  However, it happened that immediately after his victorious entrance into Toledo, Musa  dispatched ’Ali Ibn Rabah with another messenger to the Khalif, to inform him of the  conquest. Ibn Rabéh and his companion marched until they arrived at Damascus, which  city they entered in the afternoon. It being then prayer time, they went to the mosque to  pray with the other Moslems. When the service was over the Kadi began, as usual, to  invoke the interference of the Almighty against Muisa, hearing which, Ibn Rabéh rose, and  exclaimed, “ O ye men! pray to God for Misa, instead of praying against him, for, by Allah!         country had already been subdued by Mugheyth, it is probable that fataha does not imply here that Musa reduced that  city.  a Te) the plural of ped! al-amin, ‘ an inspector, a trustee;’ whence the Spanish word alamin (which has    the same meaning) is derived.",694,,

T come to tell you of the great advantages and rich spoils which both the Commander of  “ the Faithful and the Moslems have gained from his conquests, and to relate to you events  “ that will rejoice you, and also fill the heart of your Khalif with contentment.”    ° All Ibn Rabdh is introduced to the presence of Al-walid.    They say that when Al-walid heard of the arrival of a messenger from Musa, and what  he had said to the people congregated in the mosque, he immediately sent for him and had  him admitted to his presence. ‘“ What is the news?” said the Khalif to Alf. “ That which  “the Commander of the Faithful likes most,” replied the messenger. ‘“ Where is Misa,”  said Al-walid. “I left him in Andalus,” answered ’Alf, “ highly favoured by the Almighty,  “ who has granted him victories and triumphs greater than which no man ever gained before  “him; indeed, so important are his conquests that they exceed the bounds of description.  “ He sends me to thee with some of the principal men of his army, in order that we may be  “the bearers of this good news.” He then gave the letter to the Khalif, who had no sooner  perused it than he prostrated himself to return thanks to the Almighty; he then raised his  head, when a second messenger arrived with intelligence of another victory, and, on the  Khalif returning thanks as before, he was again obliged to prostrate himself by the arrival of  a third messenger, announcing another victory; “so much so,” says the person from whom  T hold this narrative, “that I thought the Khalif would never end with his prostrations.”    What Misa found in the palace of Toledo where the table was.    They say that Hém Ibn *Iyddh told them, on the authority of a learned doctor who  accompanied Miisa to the conquest of Andalus, and was present at the opening of the palace  wherein the table was found which people said had belonged to Suleyman Ibn Détid,—“ It  “was a building with twenty-four locks, one for each of the kings who had reigned in  “ Andalus, each king imitating in this respect the conduct of his predecessor. However,  “when it came to be the turn of Ludherik the Goth, in whose reign God opened Andalus  “to the Moslems, that monarch, who was a very daring man, went up to the house and said,  “© By the Messiah! I can no longer restrain my curiosity. I will ascertain what this  “building contains before I die. I will have the padlocks removed, and will enter it  “ myself.” And when the bishops, the priests, and the great men of his kingdom heard  “ of his determination, they assembled together, and went up to him and said, ‘O King!  “what is thy object in having this palace opened?’ and Ludherik answered, ‘My object   VOL.

I will certainly go in before I die.’ And the  “ priests replied, ‘May God prosper thee! It is neither safe nor convenient to go against  “ the customs established by thy honourable ancestors, the kings of this country, or to  “infringe the laws promulgated by them; desist therefore from thy rash determination,  “ imitate their conduct, and add thy padlock to the door, as thy fathers and predecessors,  “ who had better reasons than either thou or we to dread the mystery contained in this  “ palace, have done. Let not thy passion lead thee to commit an act which thy ancestors  “ considered as most dangerous to themselves.? But Ludherik exclaimed, ‘ No, by the faith  “ of the Messiah! you shall not dissuade me. The palace must and shall be opened.’ Then  “ the priests, making a last effort, said to him, ‘ Give us, O King! thy estimation of the sums  “ of money and jewels thou thinkest this palace contains; name even as many as thy fancy  “can represent, and we shall collect them among us, and bring them to thee without fail,  “yather than thou shouldst thus innovate and violate a custom which our kings, thy prede-  “ cessors, kept as sacred, since they, who knew well what they did, commanded that none  “should after them presume to investigate the mystery. However, disregarding their  “advice, Ludherik had the door opened, and when he went in he only found paintings  “ representing Arabian warriors, and an inscription bearing—‘ Whenever this palace shall  “be opened, those whose description, manners, and dress, are so and so, will invade this  “ country and subdue it entirely ;’ and so it was, for in that very year the Arabs invaded  “ Andalus.”    On the spoils which God granted to Misa and his followers.    They relate, on the authority of Al-leyth Ibn Sa’id, that during Miisa’s stay in Andalus,  some of his men having picketed their horses to the walls of a church, went inside and  began looking about them; when, lo! they saw sheets of gold and silver behind the palace  of the Rim.* They relate also, on the authority of a man who accompanied Musa in  all his expeditions in Andalus, that he once saw two men carrying away a carpet all woven  with gold, silver, pearls, and rubies, which they had stolen from a church, but, finding  it too heavy, he saw them lay down their burden, and, taking an axe, divide it in twain,  when they took one half and went away, leaving the other half on the ground. “I saw also,”  says the same individual, “several men passing right and left close to the remaining half  “ without paying the least attention to it, their hands being filled and their minds occupied  “ at the time with more valuable objects.”   And they relate that a soldier once came up to Mitisa and said to him, “ Send with me  “ some of the men, that I may guide them to a spot where I know there is a hoard ;” and  Misa sent some men along with him, and one of those who were present at the discovery         © ppd) by oalb Kail, Call syle 1515 Thus the text; but the meaning is obscure: perhaps    words are wanting.

Ixxv    said, on his return, that their guide had told them on their arrival on the spot, “ Here!  “knock here!” and they did so, when lo! a shower of emeralds and rubies, the like of  which no human eyes ever saw before, came down upon them. So great a quantity was  there of these precious stones that they were astounded with marvelling, and one of them  said to the others, “Let us send for the Amir Muisa, that he may see the treasure with  “his own eyes, for otherwise he will never credit our account.” They accordingly sent  for Musa, who came immediately, and, gazing at the hoard, was struck with utter astonishment  at its magnitude and value.   Another individual who saw the carpet represents it as being worked with two broad  stripes of gold, ornamented with threads of pearls, rubies, and emeralds. He says that  the men who found it were two Berbers, and that, being unable to carry it away, they  left it where it was, and returned with a hatchet and cut it in twain, and took as much  as they could carry, and left the remainder behind; all owing to their being intent upon  things of greater value.   Al-leyth adds, “I was told that a man who accompanied ’Atté Ibn Réfi’ and other generals,  “ in their expeditions in the West, once found a treasure which he was criminal enough to  “conceal from his comrades, putting it in a purse which he wore (suspended) between his  “ chest and his shoulder blade, and that being soon after attacked by death, he did nothing  “ else but repeat, ‘The purse! the purse!’ And I was told by Ibn Abi Leyla At-tojibi, who  “held it from Hamid, who repeated it on the authority of his father, that it was not an  “ unfrequent thing for those who accompanied Muisa’s expeditions to meet with horses which,  “ on their hoofs being examined, proved to have been shod with gold and silver nails.”    Misa’s letter to the Khalif, apprising him of the conquest of Andalus.    Misa wrote to Al-walid, “ O Commander of the Faithful! these are not like conquests,  “they are more like the meeting of the nations on the last day of judgment;” and they  relate, on the authority of ’Abdu-l-hamid, son of Hamid, who held it from his father, that he  said, “ There came to the conquest of Andalus a woman who traded in perfumes, and when  “she left this country she was the mistress of five hundred slaves ;‘ as to what she took  “ away of gold, silver, jewels, and vases, no idea can be formed of it.” The same person told  me, “ O master Raja! there once came to this country (Andalus) an old man who inhabited  “ Medinah, and he began to tell us about Andalus and about Miisa’s invasion, and we said to  “ him, ‘ How didst thou learn all that;’ and he answered, ‘I was one of Miisa’s prisoners  “and slaves; and, by Allah! what I shall presently relate to you is certain. Musa Ibn  * Nosseyr bought me for a handful of baked pepper ;/—and we said to him, ‘ How camest  “ thou hither;’ and the man answered, ‘I will tell you.

The author of the tradition says,—And they relate that Miisa left Toledo with the troops to  make war against the infidels, and that he conquered cities and towns until the whole of  Andalus submitted to him. Indeed, so far did he push his conquests, that the principal  inhabitants of Galicia came up to him to sue him for peace, which he granted. After this  Misa invaded the country of the Basques and made war against them, until they all came to  him in flocks, as if they were beasts of burden. He then took the route of the country of  the Franks, until he reached Saragossa, a city one month or forty days’ march from Cordova.  And they relate that Abdullah Ibn Mugheyrah Ibn Abi Bordah said to them, “ I was in the  “number of those who accompanied Musa to the conquest of Andalus, and I was with him  “when we arrived in sight of Saragossa, which was, with the exception of some slight  “ incursions in the districts beyond it, the farthest limit of our conquests under him. Upon  “ one occasion we came up to a city on the seashore which had four gates:” he says, “ and  “ while we were besieging it, behold! ’Ayy&sh Ibn Akhial, who was Sdhibu-sh-shortah to  “ Miisa, came up to him and said, ‘ General! we have divided the army into four bodies, one  “ for each of the gates of the city. But there remains still the farthest gate, with a buttress  © to it, and I have no men to send against it.’ Musa answered, ‘ Do not heed that gate, I shall  “ take charge of it myself, and see what is to be done.’ He then turned to me and said,  “ ¢ What stock of provisions hast thou with thee?’ ‘ Only one sack,’ answered I. ‘What!’  said Musa, ‘dost thou really mean to say that thou hast no more than one sack? I am  “ surprised to hear it; for if thou, who art one of the wealthiest men in the army, hast only  “ one, what will the others have?’ He then said, ‘O my God! Permit that the enemy come  “ out of that gate, or increase the numbers of my men;’ and Miisa’s prayer was granted, for  “ soon after the enemy sallied out of that gate, and Musa sent in pursuit of them his son  “ Merwéan, who overtook them, and spread death among them, and entered the city by that  “very gate. His men collected considerable spoil, not only from what they found on the  “ slain, but from what they took inside the city.”   He says,—And they relate that Ja’far Ibnu-l-ashtar said, “ I was in the number of those  “who invaded Andalus with Misa, and we came to a large fortress, which we besieged for  “upwards of twenty days without being able to reduce it, upon which he (Misa) grew  “ impatient, and ordered a crier to call together the men, and we received orders to be ready  “ at dawn of day, every man at his place, with his weapons and baggage. We all thought  “ that the general had received intelligence of the arrival of some body of the enemy, and  “that he wished to retreat. However, on the next morning we turned out as we were",698,,
"    APPENDIX. Ixxvii    “ ordered, and then Misa came in person, and, after praising God, said to us, ‘O men!  “I have come among you, and in front of the ranks, that you may.see what I do, and do  “like me. I shall exalt God, and then charge; do therefore as I do.’ Hearing which, the  “ men said to each other, ‘God be praised! our general has certainly lost his wits, since  “he orders us to attack stone walls.’ However, Miisa placed himself in front of the host,  so that he might be seen by all his men, and, raising his hands to heaven, began to pray,  “ and to implore the mercy of the Almighty, and to weep, he remaining long in the same  position, while we were all standing looking at him, and getting ready to attack the enemy.  * At last Muisa finished his prayers, and so did the men; he charged, and we all did the  “ same, directing our steps towards one of the sides of the fortress that we were investing.  “ Some of the garrison then came out to meet us, but in a moment our horsemen gave the  “ war-cry, charged them, and, by the help of God, the town was ours. We entered it early  “ in the morning, and made a large booty in prisoners, jewels, and numberless treasures.   The author says,—And I was told by a freed slave girl of ""Abdullah Ibn Muisa, who was a  trustworthy and honest woman, “ Muisa besieged the town where my family resided, which  “ was a very strong fortress, placed opposite to another fortified town in the neighbourhood.  “ Misa and his men remained for some time besieging us, but without being able to penetrate  “ into the town, owing to the strength and thickness of the walls. He had with him his  “ family and his sons, for he never went on an expedition without taking them with him,  “ persuaded as he was that by so doing he would gain for them the rewards of the  “ Almighty. However, the garrison made a sally and fought desperately with the Moslems,  “ victory hanging long uncertain, until at last God was pleased to grant it to his people,  “and the town was taken. Seeing this, the people of the other town surrendered, and  “thus did Musa become the master of both towns in one day. On the next day Misa  “came up to a third town, the garrison of which also sallied out against him, and fought  “so bravely with his men that part of them gave way. Muisa then ordered his tent to  “ be pitched, and his women and daughters to be placed in it without their veils. When the  “army saw this, scabbards without number were thrown away by the soldiers, who resolved  “not to sheath their swords until the enemy was vanquished; the Moslems were inspired  “with fresh vigour; the fight was renewed with increased fury, and kept up with equal  “ determination on both sides, until God was pleased to bestow his favours on Miisa and  “ make his army victorious, the town falling soon afterwards into the hands of his men.”   *Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Sélim says, “ I accompanied Muisa in all his expeditions, and never  “ did I see a banner fly from him, or a troop under his orders turn back, until the moment  “ of his death.”   Ibn Dhahan says, “ When Misa arrived in Andalus, one of the bishops of that country  * said to him, ‘O Miisa! we find thee mentioned in the books of the prophecies; for they  “tell us of an illustrious prince answering exactly thy description who is to come to this  “country. He is to be both a fisherman and a hunter, and be provided with two nets, one  “ to imprison the beasts of the land, the other to catch the fishes of the sea; and such art  “ thou, since thou hast warriors both on the land and on the sea.” When Musa heard this,  “ he was astonished and highly pleased.”",699,,
"    Ixxviii APPENDIX.    The author says,—And ’Abdu-l-hamid Ibn Hamid said, on the authority of his father, that  when Misa penetrated into the enemy’s territory, and went beyond Saragossa, his men began  to murmur, and said to him, “ Whither dost thou take us? We have gone far enough; we  “ are satisfied with the spoil we have collected.”’ To which Misa answered, “ Did ’Okbah  “ Tbn Néfi’ or ""Abdullah ever stop in the career of their conquests?” It must be remarked  that, on his entering Eastern Africa, Muisa had been heard to say, alluding to his prede-  cessors in command, ’Okbah Ibn Néfi’ and ’Abdullah, “ that they had certainly exposed  “ themselves to imminent peril, by penetrating so far into countries where they had to meet  “ enemies right and left, in front and at the back, especially as they had not with them a man  “ in whom they could trust as a faithful and experienced guide.” So that when he was heard  to express the above sentiments, Hansh As-san’ani, who was a fdbi’, and one of the most  virtuous men in the army, came out of the ranks, and taking Miuisa’s horse by the bridle, thus  addressed his general: “O Amir! I have heard thee say, that upon one occasion ’Okbah Ibn  “ Naf’, whom I knew, had exposed himself and men to certain ruin by not having a sure  “ guide to take him through the enemy’s country. It shall not be so with thee, for I will be  “ thy guide, I will conduct thee wherever thou wishest to go, be it to go out of this world, or  “ in search of conquests still more splendid and more fraught with danger than those which  “ God has already granted thee. But I must not conceal from thee that I have heard from  “the mouth of the men what thou never didst hear; they have filled their hands with  “ plunder, and now they wish for rest.’ The author continues,—When Musa heard  Hansh speak thus he burst out laughing, and said, “ May God direct thee, O Hansh!  “ and make many Moslems like thee ;” after which he ordered his men to march and return  into Andalus, not without exclaiming first, “ By Allah! had the men chosen to follow me,  “ I would have led them to the very walls of Rome, and God would, I have no doubt, have  “ granted us the victory.” *°    Misa quits Andalus.    The author of the tradition says,—And they relate that ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Sélim, who  was in Andalus with Musa, told them “ Muisa stayed in Andalus the remainder of that year  « (93), and some months of the year 94; in the meanwhile letters had reached Al-walid,  “ purporting, ‘ These are, OQ Commander of the Faithful! not like conquests; they are like  “the meeting of mankind on the day of judgment.’ Musa then began his march, taking  “ along with him the sons of the Gothic kings, and the sons of the Frankish kings, and an  “ immense booty, consisting of gold diadems, and the famous table, and the rich vases of  “ gold and silver, and many thousands of male and female slaves, and jewels beyond compu-  “ tation, and all sorts of novelties. On this occasion the principal officers of the army also  “ left Andalus and accompanied Misa.”         See a similar adventure told of Tarik. Appendix D., p. xlix.",700,,
"    APPENDIX. Ixxix    Description of the stupendous table.    The author of the tradition continues,—They say that this inestimable jewel was a dining  table,*’ but without any feet to stand upon; its materials were pure gold and silver mixed,  the colour yellow and white. It was ornamented with three rows of inestimable jewels, one  of large pearls, another of rubies, and a third of emeralds. “ Nothing,” says he, “ could  “ be conceived more rich or beautiful.” *    Arrival of Misa in Eastern Africa.    He says,—And they relate that Yezid Ibn Sa’id Ibn Moslem, who was a mauli, told them  how Muisa, on his arrival at Jezirah Al-khadhré, ordered some waggons to be made, and  thirty waggons were accordingly built, in which he stored the jewels, the gold, the silver, the  silks and brocades, and the rest of the spoil of Andalus. In this way he reached Eastern  Africa, where he stayed the remainder of the year 94. After this he left that country, and  having previously appointed his son ’Abdullah® Ibn Muisa to command in his place over  Eastern Africa, Tangiers, and Stis, he took the road of Egypt. Musa was followed by his  son Merwén, and by his son ’Abdu-l-’ala, and by his son ’Abdu-l-malek, and by one hundred  of the principal officers of his army, men belonging to the noble stock of Koraysh, or to the  Ansaris, and to others among the most illustrious by birth or adoption of the Arabian tribes,  such as *Iyédh Ibn ’Okbah, Abi ’Obeydah, ’Abdu-l-jabbér Ibn Abi Salmah Ibn ’Abdi-r-  rahmén Ibn ’Ouf, Al-mugheyrah Ibn Abi Bordah, Zor’ah Ibn Abi Mudrik, Suleyman Ibn  Bahr, and others from among the nobles. He had also with him one hundred men from the  most illustrious Berber tribes, such as the Beni Kuseylah, the Beni Yasdar,“ besides many  sons of the Berber kings, and the King of Stis-al-aksé, Marzéyah,** and the Lord of the  Castle of Auséf, and the King of Mallorca and Menorca, and twenty kings from the islands  of Rim, and one hundred princes from Andalus, Afranj, Cordova, and other countries.  Musa took also with him innumerable samples of all the natural productions of Andalus,  such as hawks, mules, horses, slaves, fruits, and every description of novelties, “ Musa,”  adds the recorder of the tradition, “ came astonishing the inhabitants of the countries through  “which he passed with the immense treasures he carried, treasures the like of which no  “ hearer ever heard of before, and no beholder ever saw before his eyes.”              he Fle Wok 82 T have suppressed here some uninteresting details.  old Fun PI 8  e    % The text reads 'Abdu-l-malek, but as this is a contradiction to what follows, I have not hesitated in substituting  ""Abdullah, “ i  "" gran sh    § Glo, -c—instead of which I believe dl jye is meant.

"    lxxx APPENDIX.    Arrival of Misa in Egypt.    The author says,—And they relate that Yezid Ibn Sa’id Ibn Moslem told them that on  Misa’s arrival in Egypt the Khalif Al-walid, who had been previously informed of his  approach, wrote to Kowah Ibn Sharik,*° who, on the demise of Ibn Refé’h,*” had been  appointed to the command of the Egyptian army, to sally out from Misr to meet Misa. In  compliance with this order Kowah went out, and made haste, and met Muisa when about to  mount his horse, and went to him, and gave him the salam. Musa then said to him, “ Who  “ art thou? cousin!” upon which Kowah, making a profound bow, said, “I am one who loves  “ thee, and wishes thee prosperity.” Kowah and his escort joined Mtisa. They all journeyed  together until they came to the Minyeh (pleasure-house) of ""Omar Ibn Merwan, where they  pitched their tents. Ibn Refé’h then spoke to Misa about the sum of money which he had  extorted from Sufyén Ibn Malek Al-fehri*—this being after the death of Sufyén; and Musa  said, “ Thine is the money,” and he gave immediate orders that ten thousand gold dinérs  should be given over to the sons of Sufyén Ibn Malek.   Musa stayed three days in Misr, during which time he was visited by all the principal  inhabitants of the town, and there remained not a Sherif in the place who did not come to  him to do him honour, and who returned not loaded with his presents. He made likewise  plentiful gifts to the sons and relatives of ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Merwan, his ancient benefactor;  so that they all came up to him from every part of Egypt, and Miisa showed great affability  to them all.   From Egypt Misa proceeded to Filisteyn (Palestine), where he was met by the tribe of  Riuh, son of Zanbé’,*? among whom he pitched his tents; and I have heard people say that they  entertained Misa and his suite most splendidly, slaughtering for their repasts no less than fifty  camels. After staying for some time among these people, Musa took his departure, leaving  with them some of his people, and his young children; and after remunerating the generous  hospitality of the Beni Ruh, son of Zanbé’, with male and female slaves, and many other  things, the produce of his conquests.    Arrival of Misa at the court of Al-walid.    They relate that Mohammed Ibn Suleymén, and others from among the principal in-  habitants of Misr, told them that when Misa arrived in Syria Al-walid was suffering from  the indisposition which soon after caused his death, and that Suleyman, who was the pre-  sumptive heir to the throne, hearing of his approach to Damascus, dispatched a messenger to         * The name of this individual is not distinctly written in my MS.

When the message reached Muisa, and he read  the contents of the letter sent him by Suleyman, he is said to have exclaimed—“ God forbid  “ that I should be guilty of such a crime! By Allah! I shall neither delay my march, nor  “ stay on the road; on the contrary, it is my intention to proceed at the usual speed: if I  “ arrive before the death of my sovereign, I need not dread his brother’s vengeance ; if he  “ should die before my arrival, I leave my destiny in the hands of God.” He then dismissed  Suleymén’s messenger, who failed not to threaten him with his master’s resentment for not  complying with his wishes, and to represent to him the awful revenge he would take for the  offence, should he succeed soon to the throne, and get Musa into his power. However, when  Al-walid heard of Musa’s arrival, and how he had disregarded the propositions made to him by  Suleymén’s wish, he wrote commanding him to make haste and appear immediately at court ;  so that even if he had wished to conciliate things, there remained no evasion, and he could  not but comply with the order of his sovereign: he therefore quickened his march and  entered Damascus before the death of Al-walid, and in time enough to present him with the  Tich spoils of Andalus, the curiosities, the pearls, the rubies, the emeralds, the male and  female slaves, the table of the prophet Suleymdn, son of Daiid, (to whom may God be  propitious!) and another table made of mother-of-pearl of different hues, and the royal  diadems of gold. All these treasures Al-walid kept for himself, and having caused the table  to be taken to pieces, ordered that the costly materials of which it was formed, such as the  rows of jewels in which it was encircled, and the mother-of-pearl, should be deposited in his _  treasury, and that the remainder should be sent to Mekka, where it was placed in the holy  temple; disposing also in the same manner of other precious things. Soon after this  Al-walid died.    Misa’s arrival at the court of Al-walid.    The author says,—And they relate that when Misa presented himself before Al-walfd, he  was sitting in the mindar, it being that day a Friday. Musa had previously issued orders to  the men of his suite to array every one of the captives he had brought with him, and to give  to each of them a gold diadem, and the robes once worn by the owners of the diadems. He  told them to dress thirty of the finest men in royal robes and royal crowns; he also gave  directions respecting the Berber princes, and the kings of the islands of Rim, and the sons of  the kings of Al-ishbén (Hispania), all of whom were to be splendidly arrayed in the costumes of  their respective countries, and to wear gold diadems on their heads. The prisoners were thus  to be introduced into the great mosque, where Al-walfd was sitting at the time: he ordered  also that all the treasures collected in Andalus, the jewels, the pearls, the rubies, the  emeralds, the mother-of-pearl, the splendid carpets, the robes of gold and silver tissue,  sprinkled with pearls, rubies, and emeralds, should be brought in and placed also before  Al-walid. These orders being complied with, Musa made his entrance into the mosque,  followed by thirty youths belonging to the royal family of the Franks, magnificently arrayed  in robes of gold tissue, and wearing royal crowns upon their heads. When Misa entered,  Al-walfd was preaching to the men from the top of the mindar; for although he was very   VOL. I. . i",703,,

When Al-walid saw them come in such admirable order he  seemed struck with astonishment ; a loud murmur was also heard among the men, and voices  saying, “ Here comes Misa, the son of Nosseyr; here comes Miisa:”—and Muisa then came  forward, and advanced majestically toward the mindar ; and having saluted Al-walid, remained  standing where he was with the princes with the royal crowns, drawn up in two lines, half to  the right side of the mindar, and the other half to the left. Al-walid then began to praise  God, and to give him thanks for the favours and victories he had been pleased to grant the  Moslems; he then delivered a speech, the like of which no human ears ever listened to, and  protracted it until the hour of prayers was at hand: he then said his prayers along with  the men, and the service finished, he sat down, and bade Miisa approach his person; and  taking his own dress off, put it on him three times in succession, and gave him besides fifty  thousand dinérs, and granted pensions for all his sons, as well as for five hundred of his  maulis. After this Musa gave orders for the rest of the suite and the prisoners to make their  appearance ; and presently in came the kings of the Berbers, and the kings of the Rim, and  the kings of Al-ishban, and the kings of the Franks; then followed all the Moslems whom  Misa had brought with him from Africa, most of whom belonged to the tribe of Koraysh,  and other illustrious families, who were most magnificently attired for the occasion. Al-walid  then distributed among them pensions, honours, and distinctions. Forty days after Mutisa’s  interview with Al-walid, this Khalif died, and was succeeded by his brother Suleyman.    Suleymdn’s accession to the throne, and his conduct towards Misa.    They relate that ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Sélim told them that the first thing Suleym&n did  on his coming to power was to send for Misa and make him appear in his presence, when he  bitterly abused him and reproached him for his past conduct. They say that he told him  among other things— Thou hast run against my will, and disobeyed my orders, and, by Allah!  “1 will cut off thy resources, scatter thy friends, and seize upon thy treasures; I will  “ deprive thee of all the honours conferred upon thee by the sons of Abi Sufyan and the  “sons of Merw4n, those whose benefits thou hast repaid with ingratitude, betraying the  “hopes they placed on thee.” And Musa answered, “ By Allah! O Commander of the  “ Faithful! do not charge me with the faults of others; I was always faithful to the Khalifs  “of thy family, as well as to thy predecessors in command; I showed myself on every  “ occasion the grateful servant of those who protected me and extolled me: as to thy saying,  “ © Commander of the Faithful! that thou wilt cut off my resources, scatter my friends, and  “ seize upon my treasures, that rests in the hands of the Almighty God, who is the arbiter of  “ men’s fortunes, and can take away whenever he pleases the favours he bestows on his  “ creatures. In Him I trust, O Commander of the Faithful! for He is the refuge of those  “who are accused of crimes which they never committed, and who are threatened with  “ chastisement which they do not deserve.” Suleyman then ordered Muisa to be exposed  to the sun, and his commands were immediately executed: he was left standing under a  broiling sun; and as he was subject to asthma, the excessive heat, together with the fatigue",704,,

Ixxxiii    of many hours’ standing, brought on his complaint more fiercely than ever, and he was on the  point of being suffocated several times, remaining in that state until ""Omar Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz,  whom Suleym4n had sent out to see that his orders respecting Musa were punctually  executed, came upon the spot, and found him in a swoon. ’Omar is known to have said  some time after this,—* I declare I never passed a worse day in all my life; I never was  “so sadly afflicted as that day when I saw the old warrior, on whom God had been pleased  “to bestow so many favours, after so many battles fought for the cause of God and true  “religion, and so many victories won, lie in that miserable plight. I went straight to  “ Suleyman, and when he saw me he said, ‘ What is the meaning of this,O Abu Hafs?®  * T really think that thou also wishest to deny me obedience.’”—’Omar says, “ I thought the  “ opportunity a favourable one, and said to him, O Commander of the Faithful! Musa is an  “infirm old man, he is subject to an asthma, and, by Allah! thou wilt be the cause of his  * death; I have come to implore thy pardon for him: consider that the old warrior has  “ fought long and bravely for the cause of God and religion, and that he has been the means  “ of gaining the many victories by which the Moslems have become rich.’”—’Omar added,  “and whoever prevents me from speaking as I do in his favour, I deny him all allegiance,  “and I shall hate him for it.”—’Omar says, “ I was fearful lest I should have gone too far,  “ and that we should get into a dispute, and he should feel hungry; so when I heard him  “ say what he afterwards said to me, I praised God, (may His name be praised!) and I be-  “ came certain that He had inspired him with generous sentiments, and that he began to feel  “ repentant of what he had done; and so it was, for all of a sudden he exclaimed —‘ Who  “ will be security for Misa’s future behaviour, if I pardon him?? Then Yezid Ibn Muhlib,  “ who was an intimate friend of Musa, and was present at this interview, rose and said, ‘I  “ will be his security, O Commander of the Faithful ! ’""—* Well, then, I take thy security for  “ Misa, and thou shalt not be treated harshly on account of him.’” Yezid then went up to  Misa with a horse belonging to his son ® Mokhlid, and made him ride it, and took him away.  Some days after this Yezid contrived to adjust matters between Suleymén and Misa, and the  former set him entirely free, on condition of his paying a fine of three millions of dinars.    The number of Miisa’s maulis.    They relate, on the authority of an inhabitant of Basrah, that an Arab, living in that city,  told them—* The night of the day in which Musa was released by the interference of Yezid,         © ’Omar Ibn ’Abdi-1-’aziz, who succeeded his cousin Suleymén in the Khalifate, took the name of Abi Hafe from one of  his sons. See Abi-l-fedé, An. Mosl. vol. ii. p. 94.    The Khalif Suleymén was a second Heliogabalus.

Why didst thou not remain in the seat of thy  “ power and the abode of thy glory? why didst thou not send by means of messengers that  “ which thou didst bring in person? Hadst thou done so, we should have been satisfied with  “ thy presents, and overlooked thy disobedience, and thy affairs would not have come to the  “ evil plight in which they now are.’ ¢ By Allah !” replied Misa, ‘had my intention been  “such, you would never have seen a single thing of the many treasures you have received  “from Andalus, never until the last day of judgment; but I swear to God, that it never  “entered my mind to deny obedience to the Khalif, and desert the cause of the people.’”  The author of this tradition adds,—That when Yezid took leave of Mtisa to go home, the  latter made a sign to the company and exclaimed, “ By Allah! had I had” Abi Khéled’s *  “ good sense, I should not be reduced to this condition.”   [I have omitted the translation of a chapter entitled ‘‘ The wonderful things which Musa saw in the   West,” because, though very interesting in itself, it contains no historical information].    Suleyman questions Misa about Maghreb.    The author says,—And they relate, on the authority of Mohammed® Ibn Suleymén, that  Suleyman Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek said once to Misa, “ Whom didst thou appoint to command in  “thy name in Andalus?” “ My son ’Abdu-l-’aziz,” said Musa. “ And who is thy lieutenant  “in Africa proper, Tangiers, and Sis?” inquired Suleyman. “ My son ’Abdullah,” answered  Misa. “Thou seemest to me to entertain a very favourable idea of thy sons, since thou  “ didst appoint them to such trusts,” replied Suleyman. The same individual above men-  tioned, Mohammed Ibn Suleyman, says that Musa answered Suleymén in these words: “ O  “ prince of the believers! who is there in thy dominions who can boast of having sons more  “accomplished than mine? My son Merwén brought Ludherik, the King of Andalus,  “ captive; my son Abdullah brought the Kings of Mallorca, Menorca, Sicily, and Sardinia;  “my son Merwin brought the King of Siis-al-aksé; and they shared between them the  “ cities and the countries, bringing innumerable captives. Who can after this boast of  “ better sons, O prince of the believers!”—upon which Suleymén appeared angry, and said  to Misa, “ Dost thou really mean to say that the prince of the believers has no advantage  “ over thee on this account?” ‘The case of the prince of the believers,” said Muisa, “ is  “ above all others; every thing is subordinate to him, and all are to obey his power and  “ authority.”         6 Abd Khéled was Yezid's surname.    This Mohammed Ibn Suleym4n seems to have been one of the sons of that Khalif, for I find in the Kitdbu-l-khamis, by  Diyarbekri, that Suleymén left a son of that name.",706,,
"    APPENDIX. Ixxxv    Various other opinions current upon Suleymdn’s treatment of Misa.    They say,—When Suleyman succeeded his brother Al-walfd in the Khalifate, he was greatly  incensed against Al-hejéj and against Muisa, towards whom he had conceived great enmity,  for things which it would be too: long for us to relate here; he had, therefore, sworn their  execution whenever he should get them into his hands. One day, accordingly, Suleyman  sent for his brother Omar Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz, and said to him, “ I shall have Muisa crucified  “ to-morrow ;”—upon which Omar immediately sent for Misa, and when in his presence  said to him, “ O son of Nosseyr! I love thee for four things. First, I love thee on account  “of thy praiseworthy actions in the cause of God and religion, and thy brilliant exploits  “against his enemies. Secondly, I love thee because thou art a Moslem, and followest  “strictly the precepts of our Prophet, (may God’s blessing and salutation be on him!)  “ Thirdly, I love thee because of the affection and esteem thou hast always shown for *Iydédh  “© Ibn ’?Okbah, knowing the regard I entertained for him. (’Tyédh was a very honest and  “ religious man.) Fourthly, I love thee because of the great favour thou didst always enjoy  “with my father ’Abdu-l-’aziz, and the many benefits he conferred upon thee, and I now  “ wish to follow his example, and add a new favour to the sum of his favours. Owing to the  “ above-mentioned reasons I come to tell thee how I have this very moment heard the prince  “ of the believers say that he intended to have thee crucified to-morrow, and I now come to  “ warn thee of thy danger, that thou mayest consult thy safety, since it is incumbent upon  “ thee to do so.” And Misa said to him, “I have already done so, and my determination is  “taken; I place myself entirely in thy hands.” And ’Omar replied, “ Very well, if pardon  “ is to be obtained for thee, it shall be at my hands; those whom I love may safely rely on  “me.” Musa then retired and went home; he washed and perfumed himself, and sat quietly  waiting for his execution, for he doubted not but that he would be crucified in the course of  that day. It was then summer time, and the heat was intense; presently, when noon came,  and the sun was at the highest, in walked Suleyman’s officers and took him to the Khalif’s  presence. Musa was a very aged and corpulent man; he was subject to an asthma which  troubled him much. Arrived in the presence of the Khalif, Miisa stood humbly before him,  when Suleymén began to rail at him and upbraid him. Musa then said, “ By Allah! O  “ prince of the believers! is this my desert? Is this the reward of a man who, like myself,  “has been so meritorious in the service of God, and who has, through his exertions, been  “ the cause of pouring boundless wealth on the Moslems,—of a man who has so faithfully and  “ honourably served thy ancestors?” And Suleyman said to him, “Thou liest! may God kill  “ me if I do not put thee to death, and cause thee to be crucified.” After many sayings on  both sides, Mtisa exclaimed, “ By Allah! those who are underneath the earth are dearer to  “me than those who are upon it.” ‘Whom dost thou mean?” replied Suleyman in a  violent rage. “I mean,” said Musa, “thy brothers Merwan, ’Abdu-l-malek, and Al-walid,  “ and thy uncle ’Abdu-l~’aziz.” Hearing this, Suleyman was on the point of bursting with  rage; he then repeated again, “ May God kill me if I do not put thee to death!” And Muisa  said, “ My destiny is in the hands of God. I expect no mercy at the hands of the prince of",707,,
"    Ixxxvi APPENDIX.    “ the believers. But if God has decreed that I should live, all his anger is to no purpose.”  “ Wretch!” said Suleymén, and he gave orders for Miisa’s exposure; and Muisa was exposed  to a scorching sun until his blood was heated and his strength exhausted. Some time after-  wards ‘Suleyman turned towards ’Omar Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz, and said to him, “O ’Omar! I  shall not be satisfied unless thou go out and see that my orders are faithfully executed.”  And ’Omar seized the opportunity and went out, as I have elsewhere related, for he after-  wards said to the person from whom I hold this narrative, “I was unwilling to draw on  “ myself the ill-will of the Arabian tribes, who were all, to a man, the friends of Misa, by  “not interfering warmly in his favour;” so, when ’Omar returned, he said to the Khalif,  “ Forgive him, O prince of the believers! He is a weak old man, exhausted by fatigue and  “the asthma under which he is suffering; and if he remain longer in that state I expect to  “ find him dead when I return.” These words made some impression upon Suleymén, who,  turning towards the counsellors who were sitting with him, said, “ Whoever will take this  “ (order] shall deliver Muisa from his present situation, upon the surrender of all these  “ treasures.” Then Yezid Ibn Muhlib rose from his seat and said, “I will, O Commander of  “the Faithful!” “Take it, then,” said Suleyman; “I grant thee his life; but mind, I do  “ not intend to remit the punishment of his two sons, Merwén and ’Abdu-l-’ala.”© Yezid  then went out with the Khalif’s order, and, having released Muisa, made him mount his own  horse, and took him to his house, where he treated him kindly, and administered to him  such remedies as he stood in need of. He then said to him, “Thou art free on these  “conditions, but leave the rest in my hands, and I shall satisfy the Commander of the  “ Faithful as to his decree respecting thee and thy two sons; give me thy instructions, and I  “ will be the bearer of thy answer.” And Misa said to him, “Since thou art the principal  “ manager in this business, and hast offered thyself a security for me, I shall in no manner  “ interfere in thy arrangements with the prince of the believers; had any one but thee taken  “in hand this affair, I would willingly have died, and surrendered my soul to God, rather  “ than give up to him one single dirhem of my money; but since matters stand thus, I am  “ ready to abide by thy agreement.” He then turned towards his two sons who were in the  room and said to them, “ My sons, Prepare to suffer, and may God help you and your  “ father ;” and they answered, “ We shall.   On the morning of the next day Yezid went to the palace and told Suleymén how Miisa  had agreed to abide by his sentence. Muisa was then ordered to the presence of the Khalif,  and when admitted said to him, “ Did I not tell thee that unless the Almighty. decreed it,  “ thou wouldst never accomplish my execution ;” upon which Suleymén said to him, “ Thy-  “ self and thy two sons are in my power until the sentence issued against thee be fully  “ accomplished, and the whole of thy fine delivered into the hands of my treasurers.”—  And Misa said to him, “ May thy will be done, O Commander of the Faithful! only grant  “ me four things, and thine are all my riches.” ‘“ And what are they?” exclaimed Suleyman.         %® These two sons of Masa, who were with him at Damascus, could only be Merwan, who was afterwards killed in battle in  Spain, and ’Abdu-l-’ala ; for his two other sons, Abdullah and ’Abdu-l-’aziz, had been intrusted by their father,—the former  with the government of Africa, the latter with that of Spain. Neither is it easy to guess why Suleyman should be offended  with them.",708,,
"    APPENDIX. Ixxxvii    « Firstly, not to remove my son ’Abdullah from his government of Eastern Africa and the  “ adjacent countries for a space of two years to come; secondly, not to remove my son  “?Abdu-l~aziz from the government of Andalus; thirdly, that all the plunder taken from  “ the infidels by my two sons shall not be confiscated, but given to me; and to deliver into  “ my hands the person and the property of my mauli Tarik: upon these conditions I am  “ prepared to abide by thy sentence, and to deliver into thy hands all my treasures.”  Suleyman then replied,—“ As to thy request that I should suffer thy sons, Abdullah and  “ *Abdu-l-’aziz, to remain in command of their respective governments for two years, I grant  “it; as to my delivering into thy hands thy freedman T4rik, in order that thou mayest freely  “ dispose of his person and property, that I cannot accede to, for it would be a sad reward for  “ a man who has behaved so honestly towards the Commander of the Faithful. No! Thou  “ shalt not punish him, neither shall I make thee the master of his treasures.” Musa then  paid down the sums asked by Suleyman; and, having received a written discharge, was  suffered to go whither he pleased.    The following is a transcript of the sentence issued against Miisa.    This is the sentence imposed by the servant of God, Suleymaén, Commander of the Faithful,  on Misa, the son of Nosseyr; namely :—“‘ That the said Muisa shall pay into the hands of  “ Suleyman, or of his collectors, the sum of four millions and thirty thousand gold dinérs, of  “ good weight. The Commander of the Faithful has already received one hundred thousand  “ dinars on account of the above sum ; but, as the remainder is still unpaid, the Commander  “of the Faithful grants Musa a term during which a messenger shall be dispatched to  “ Andalus to procure the said sum from his son ’Abdu-l-’aziz: the messenger will present the  “order to ’Abdu-l-’aziz, and wait one month for its fulfilment; at the expiration of which  “time, without waiting one day more, he is to return with or without the money, and go tu  “ Africa, and do the same with his son ’Abdullah. Misa shall not consider as part of the  “ payment of that fine the sums which he may have collected in his various governments  “since Suleyman’s accession to the throne, whether proceeding from the capitation-tax  “ paid by the infidels, or from the ransom of cities threatened with the sword, or from  “any spoil gained on the field of battle; since all those sums the Commander of the  “ Faithful considers as his own, and takes possession of them. And when the said Misa  “has paid down the sums of money specified in this letter, and for the final payment of  “which the Commander of the Faithful grants him a month’s time, as above stated,  “the said Musa shall be held free, as well as his sons, relations, and maulis ; they shall  “in nowise ibe molested, nor fined, nor disturbed, but shall, on the contrary, be allowed  “to settle and reside where they best like. Whatever governments Misa and his sons by  “ delegation may hold at the arrival of the messenger sent by the Commander of the Faithful,  “there shall be no alteration made in them. The Commander of the Faithful shall not in-  “ terfere in any manner whatsoever between Muisa Ibn Nosseyr and his relations and mauiis,  “and no complaint from the same against Musa shall be listened to; but neither the person  “ of his freedman Tarik, nor any article of his property, shall be delivered up to Musa.",709,,

In return for his present Muisa gave Yezid a sandal  embroidered with pearls, which, when valued, proved to be worth three hundred thousand  dinérs. And they say that Yezid asked Muisa one day, “ Dost thou know why I said to  “ the Commander of the Faithful that I would stand security for thee?” and Musa answered,  “No, I do not.” “I did it,” replied Yezid, “fearing lest some one else should come  “ forward who was not bound to thee by the same obligations.”   (Here follows a chapter entitled ‘‘ How Misa became a favourite with Yezid Ibn Muhlib,” which I  have altogether omitted, as well as three more,—giving an account of the death of ’Abdu-1-’aziz,  son of Misa ;—the series of the Mohammedan governors of Spain ;—and the establishment of the  dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah ;—which will find a place in the second volume of this work.]    The questions which Suleymdén put to Misa on his doings and his conquests.    They say that Suleymén upon a certain occasion asked Musa the following questions.  « What made thee so bold whilst attacking the enemy of God?” “ Reliance on his power,  “ and prayers for his help, O Commander of the Faithful!” answered Miisa. “ Didst thou  “ fortify thyself in castles, or surround thy encampments with trenches?” “TI did nothing  “ of the sort,” replied Misa. ‘“ What then?” inquired Suleyman. “1 always fixed my tents  “ in the plains, that I might judge better of the courage or cowardice of my men; I never had  “any fortification but that of the sword, no other help but that of the Almighty, whom I  * never ceased to beg and implore to grant me the victory.” ‘“ Whom among the Arabian  “ tribes, serving under thy orders, didst thou deem the bravest soldiers?” said Suleyman.  “ The Arabs of Himyar,” answered Musa. “ And what horses the fleetest and the best?”  “The bays.” “ And tell me what nations didst thou conquer—who among thy enemies  “ were the most formidable in battle?” ‘That is more than I can say, O Commander of the  “ Faithful! for I had to contend against innumerable nations, all of whom were brave on the  “field.” “ Tell me about the Greeks,” retorted Suleymén. “ The Greeks,” said Misa,  “are lions within their castles, eagles on their horses, women in their ships; if they see an         7 There is a blank in the text; probably ’Abdu-1-malek is intended, for I find further down in the work that Suleyman  had a second-cousin thus named.    ® It is not said whether this month of Juméda is the first or the second of the Mohammedan calendar.

Ixxxix    “ opportunity they immediately seize it, but if the day turns against them they are goats in  “ascending their mountains, and so swift-footed in their flight that they scarcely see the  “land they tread.” “ Tell me about the Berbers.” “The Berbers, O Commander of the  “ Faithful! are of all foreign nations the people who resemble most the Arabs in impetuosity,  “ corporal strength, endurance, military science, generosity, only that they are, O Commander  “of the Faithful! the most treacherous people on earth.” ‘And what sayest thou of the  “ people of Ishbén (Hispania) ?” ‘ They are luxurious and dissolute lords, but knights who  “ do not turn their faces from the enemy.” “ And the Franks?” “ The Franks, O Com-  “ mander of the Faithful! have numbers, resources, strength, and valour.” Then Musa  added, “ Among the nations just described there are men of honour and probity, there are  “ also traitors and knaves; some were for peace, others for war; some we subdued, to others  “ we granted terms; some observed faithfully the treaties, some violated them; but we met  “them all, each man according to his temper.” ‘ But tell me,” replied Suleymén, “ of thy  “ battles with them,—was thy army ever defeated by them?” “ Never, O Commander of the  “ Faithful! Never did a banner turn away from me, nor a troop under my orders show their  “backs to the enemy; as long as I commanded the Moslems were never defeated, never  “from the moment I entered upon my fortieth year until the present moment, being upon  “ my eightieth.” Hearing which Suleyman smiled scornfully, and observed, “ Where is then  “the banner thou borest on the day of Merj-Réhitt, under Adh-dhahhék Ibn Kays?”7°  “ That was the banner of Zubeyr, and we are now talking of those of the Beni Merwén,”  replied Musa. “Thou art right, O man!” said Suleymén, greatly astonished at Muisa’s  quick answer.  * * * * * * * *   Ibn Riyén asserts that Musa continued thus enjoying the favour of the Khalif until the year  98 came, when Suleymén, having decided upon making a pilgrimage to Mekka, ordered that  Musa should be one of his suite; but upon its being represented to him that he was a weak  old man, and could not bear the fatigue of the journey, he commanded that a pregnant  camel should be prepared for him, and that he should be provided besides with one of his  own * * * * and a suitable stock for the journey; and Musa, accordingly, accompanied  Suleyman to Mekka.   The author says,—I was told by an inhabitant of Medina that Miisa said, on a certain day,  to a trustworthy man, who told him of it himself,— Before two days there shall die in this  “town a man whose fame has filled the East and the West.” We all thought, says the  author of the tradition, that he meant the Khalif; but on the morning of the second day, as  we were saying our prayers in the mosque of the Messenger of God, (may the benediction and  salutation of the Lord attend him!) we heard the people say, “ Miisa, the son of Nosseyr, is         7 bal 1& yo Mer}-Rahitt is the name of a place in Syria, the field of a celebrated battle fought (a.m. 64) between  Merwén Ibn Al-hakem, of the family of Umeyyah, and the partisans of Zubeyr, commanded by Dhahhék Ibn Kays, who  perished in the action. I have collated the whole of this account with the MS. of Ibn Habfb in the Bodl. Lib., and found  it, like many other passages in this fragment, word for word.

He remained in Eastern Africa sixteen  years. He left that country for the East in the year ninety-five (A.p. 713). He died, as we  have already stated, in the year 98. His son ’Abdullah governed after him Eastern Africa,  Tangiers, and the province of Stis, for two years, until he was deposed at the end of the year  99. His son ’Abdu-l-’aziz was killed in the month of Dhi-l-hajjah of the same year. May  God pour his mercies upon them both!

In addition to my notice on the life and writings of Ibnu Khaldin, I deem it necessary to state that he  must have resided for some time at Granada, for I find that Ibnu-]-khattfb mentions him in his Biographical Dictionary.  According to this writer, Ibnu Khaldin wrote a treatise on logic for the use of Ydsuf Ibn Isma’fl, King of Granada, with  whom he rose high in favour. There is in the Escurial Library, No. 1609, a work on special jurisprudence, bearing the date  of a.. seven hundred and fifty-two (a.p. 1351), and written by Ibnu Khalddn himself; where he takes the patronymic  “ Al-gharnéttf.”   Page 320, Note 36. There can be no doubt that Majma’u-l-bahreyn is here meant; but I am not aware of any  promontory on the coast of Galicia being so called by the Arabian geographers. Idrisf, whom I have consulted, states no  such thing; on the contrary, he says that the spot called Majma’u-l-bahreyn (the meeting of the two seas) was close to  Gibraltar, where the junction of the Ocean and Mediterranean takes place.

"    xciv ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS.    the origin of the tradition recorded by Ibnu Bashkéwél. It is the history of the Mohammedan conquests under the first  three Khalifs, by ’Abu-l-kasim ‘Abdu-r-rahman Ibn Mohammed Ibn 'Abdillah Ibn Hobaysh. At the end of the chapter    treating of the conquest of Africa, I find these remarkable words: Wc wurde du! 3 IL ib 9 ws wt)    ot Bil oe GUS Lays ge Gull oe BU a oe tel yy al  oh dele ail OM al ye gl all wey lie Gil y yt US Go BLE Lait!    2  phatl y ged os Ga? ye Kt pS gE be ot Gly Gt US Ge id Li Rubik tl  “ And they say, on the authority of Mohammed and Tolhah, that immediately after this [the taking of Ifrikiyyah] ""Othman  “ sent ’Abdullah [bn Naf’ Ibni-l-hassin and Abdullah Ibn Naf’ Ibn ’Abdi-l-kays from Ifrikiyyah to Andalus, which country  “ they attacked from the sea. And 'Othmén (the mercy of God be upon him!) wrote to them at the time, ‘ Know ye that  “ Constantinople shall be conquered by people from Andalus; therefore, if you subdue that country, you shall. participate in  “ the rewards promised to those who will conquer that city.’”” .

But I was not aware at the  time I wrote this note that Ibn Alisa’ died in five hundred and seventy-five (a.p. 1179), and therefore that Ibn Hazm, who  preceded him by nearly one century, could never have alluded to a work of his; whence I conclude that there must be two  histories of the Mohammedan settlements in the West bearing the same title: one the composition of Ibn Alisa’, who died  in a.#. 575, the other written much before that time; since it is mentioned by the author of the epistle, whose death took  place in a.H. 426,    Page 464, Note 134. The title of Az-zahrawi’s work might as well, perhaps better, be rendered by ‘ ample permission  (of borrowing) for those who cannot compose works on medicine.”    Page 530, line 5, read J  Page xxvii, line 14, read wy)    x, line 13, read oolout    Page li, line 5, read ‘ Abdullah.’          Page xx1    Notwithstanding the great attention which the translator has given to the spelling of proper names and titles of Arabic works,  some unavoidable mistakes have been committed, chiefly in cases when the words were susceptible of various pronunciations.  In the eye of an Oriental scholar these are not, properly speaking, errors; but as the reader unacquainted with the languages  of Asia might be startled by finding a proper name or the title of a book spelt in two different ways, the following list of  corrections should be attended to.
