" After making war against them until they were nearly exterminated, he caused  the few who remained to be embarked on board some vessels, and giving them  for commander an officer of the name of Batrikus, he allowed them to go whither  they pleased. Batrikus and his men first cast anchor at a place on the western  shore of Andalus, and settled at Cadiz. Having afterwards advanced into the  interior of the country, they found that, owing to the fall of rain, the land had  recovered its former aspect, the fields were adorned with verdure, the rivers flowed,  the fountains ran, and the trees were covered with leaves. Encouraged by what  they saw, they proceeded still farther, spread themselves about the country,  extended their settlements, built cities and towns, and increased their numbers  by marriage. However, they settled in preference in that part of the country  hetween the place of their landing in the west, and the country of the Franks  in the east, and appointed kings to rule over them and administer their affairs.  Their religion was the same as that of their predecessors in the country, that is,  they worshipped idols. They fixed their capital at Talikah (Italica), a city now  in ruins, and which once belonged to the district of Ishbiliah (Seville). But,  after a period of one hundred and fifty-seven years, during which eleven kings  of that race reigned over Andalus, God Almighty permitted that they should all  be annihilated by the barbarians of Rome, who invaded and conquered the country.  “ After the defeat and destruction of the Africans, the empire of Andalus  “ devolved to the people of Rome and their king Ishbén, son of Titus, after  ‘‘whom Andalus was called Ishbdniah.

" Tabaristén (the Caspian sea), whose waters have no communication whatsoever  with those of other seas, and that Andalus and the opposite land of Africa were  joined together so as to form only one continent, owing to which the people  of the remote West (Maghrebu-l-aksa) were continually making incursions into  Andalus, and visiting its inhabitants with destruction and war. On the arrival  of Iskhander in Andalus, the people appeared before him, and humbly besought  him that he would put a stop to the hostile incursions of their neighbours, upon  which Iskhander, having taken the subject into consideration, called together  his architects and geometricians, and bid them appear in his presence on the  spot now occupied by Bahru-z-zok4k (Straits of Gibraltar). He then commanded  them to measure the level of the two seas (the Ocean and Mediterranean), which  being done, the first (the Ocean) was found to be a little the higher. This being  reported to Iskhander, he issued immediate orders for the demolition of all the  cities which stood on the coast of the Mediterranean, enjoining at the same time  that they should be rebuilt farther into the country on more elevated situations.  He next caused a deep trench or canal to be dug between Tangiers and Andalus,  and the digging was carried so deep into the earth that the crests of the mountains  of the lower world became visible.’ When the excavation was completed, a  wharf,” of great dimensions, and built with stone and mortar, an admirable work  of art, was erected all along the coast of Andalus, measuring in length twelve  miles, the distance which then separated the two seas.

" “idol, that it was a short stick, of about twelve spans in length, having at the  “end some teeth like a curry-comb. Who was the builder of this tower, with  “the idol on the top, does not sufficiently appear. Mes’idi, in his ‘ Golden  “ Meadows,’ ® attributes its construction to Al-jabbdr,® the same who built the  “ seven idols in the country of Zinj, which are one in sight of the other: but  “the most probable opinion seems to be that it was built by some of the ancient  “ kings of Andalus to serve as a guide to navigators, from the fact of the idol  “ having his left arm extended towards the Bahru-z-zok4k (straits), and pointing  “to the mouth, as if he was showing the way. There were not wanting people  “who thought this idol to be made of pure gold; for whenever the rising or  “ setting sun fell on the statue it sent forth rays of light, and shone in the  “ brightest hues, like the collar of a ring-dove, blue being the colour which  “ prevailed. Thus placed on the top of the tower the idol was like a signal for  “ the Moslem navigators to go in and out of the Ocean, and whoever wanted to  “ sail from any port in the Mediterranean to places in Al-maghreb, such as Lisbon,  ‘and others, had only to approach the tower, and then put up the sails, and  “make for the port whither they wished to go, whether Salé, Anfa, or any  “ other in the western coast of Africa. When in after times this idol was pulled  “ down, it ceased of course to be a signal for navigators: its demolition happened  “thus. In the year 540 (a. D. 1145-6), at the beginning of the second civil war,  “ *Ali Tbn Isa Ibn Maymin,""” who was Admiral of the Fleet, revolted at Cadiz, and  “ declared himself independent. Having heard the inhabitants say that the idol on  “« the top of the tower was made of pure gold, his cupidity was raised, and he gave  “ orders for its immediate removal. The statue was accordingly brought down by  “ dint of great exertions, and when on the ground was found to be made of brass,  “ covered only with a thin coat of gold, which, when removed, produced twelve  “ thousand gold dinars. It is a general opinion among Andalusian and African  “Moslems that this idol exercised a sort of spell over the sea, but that the charm  “ ceased the moment it was thrown down.

A very entertaining  anecdote is told of a famous highwayman, called Al-bdziyu-l-ash’ab (the Grey-hawk),  who lived in the time of Al-mu’atamed, King of Seville. He was renowned for his °  dexterity and courage, and soon became the scourge of the country; for at the  head of a small band of chosen followers he began to scour the fields, surprising  the inhabitants in their farms and villages, and depriving them of their valuables.  Long did he baffle the search of justice, and escape from every troop sent for his  apprehension ; but, at last, he fell one day into the hands of the king’s officers, and  the event being reported to Al-mu’atamed, he was sentenced to be crucified by the  side of a much-frequented path, in the midst of the very district which had been the  principal theatre of his depredations. The sentence having been duly carried into  execution, the poor man was hanging miserably stretched on the cross, when, behold !  his wife and daughters came up, and began to sob and wail around him, exclaiming,  in the midst of their tears, “Our doom is signed, and our deaths are certain ; who  “« shall provide for us when thou art no more?” They were thus lamenting over  their misfortune when a peasant happened to pass by, riding on a mule, and having  before him something like a large bundle of clothes or goods.—‘‘ Friend,” said the  robber on the cross to the passenger, “take pity on me, and, since thou seest me  ‘in this condition, grant me a last favour, which will prove beneficial to thee too.”  “ And what is it, pray?” said the peasant. ‘Go to yonder well,” replied the  robber, ‘‘ and thou shalt find at the bottom one hundred dindrs in a purse, which,  “as I was closely pursued by the constables, I threw therein ; if thou succeed in  “‘ getting them out, half shall be thy reward; the remaining half thou must  “ give to my wife and daughters here, that they may support themselves for a",book_1,chapter_8,True," “* disturb the public tranquillity at night by their brawls and clamours, or commit  ‘the most daring robberies; for it is by no means an uncommon thing in our  “* times to hear of a gang of robbers assembling at night, attacking a strong house,  ‘* penetrating into it, plundering it of whatever property they find, and murdering  “all its inmates for fear they should offer any resistance, or assist the next day.in  ‘“‘ their discovery and apprehension. it is therefore a thing of frequent occurrence  ‘in andalus to hear people say,—‘ last night robbers broke into the house of such  “a one, or such a one was found murdered in his bed.’”’ it is true, observes our  author, that crimes of this kind are not equally common all over andalus, and  are generally confined to large cities, and, even there, they are more or less frequent  according to the severity or indifference shown by the authorities; but in general  it must be owned that although the greatest rigour has been at times employed  against robbers, so much as to inflict capital punishment for stealing a bunch of  grapes out of a vineyard, and that the sword of justice has dropped with their  blood, andalus has never been quite free from that scourge. a very entertaining  anecdote is told of a famous highwayman, called al-bdziyu-l-ash’ab (the grey-hawk),  who lived in the time of al-mu’atamed, king of seville. he was renowned for his °  dexterity and courage, and soon became the scourge of the country; for at the  head of a small band of chosen followers he began to scour the fields, surprising  the inhabitants in their farms and villages, and depriving them of their valuables.  long did he baffle the search of justice, and escape from every troop sent for his  apprehension ; but, at last, he fell one day into the hands of the king’s officers, and  the event being reported to al-mu’atamed, he was sentenced to be crucified by the  side of a much-frequented path, in the midst of the very district which had been the  principal theatre of his depredations. the sentence having been duly carried into  execution, the poor man was hanging miserably stretched on the cross, when, behold !

"In the first years of the conquest the Moslems of Andalus were subject to  the payment of those legal taxes designated in the Sunnah, and which every  Moslem is bound to contribute. This, joined to certain customs paid by the  Jews and Christians, was more than sufficient to meet the expenses of the court  and carry on the government, but in latter times the splendour assumed by  the Sulténs of the family of Merw4n, their prodigality towards the learned, and  the numerous armies they were obliged to keep constantly on foot, made it  necessary for them to impose new tributes on their Moslem subjects, although  every exaction of the kind is expressly forbidden by the text of the law.

"The princes of the family of Hiid who reigned at Saragossa in the fifth century  of the Hijra being continually at war, not only with the Christians who surrounded  them on every side, but with their brethren among the Moslems during the long  and bloody civil wars which ravaged that country, had naturally numerous armies  in the best order and military discipline, and generals to command them, who, from  their indomitable courage and superior tactics, cast terror into the hearts of the  infidels. There were also warriors of tried courage, and unparalleled dexterity in  the handling of weapons, who in single combat with the Christian knights never  failed to gain the victory over their adversaries.

There happened to be among the pieces of  ground thus appropriated by the builders a small orchard belonging to a good old  man, who more than any other resented and opposed the spoliation, on the plea  that the piece of ground did not belong to him, but was the property of an orphan  of whom he was the guardian.

When the wax was removed, Al-mu’atassem found inside a  scroll of paper, in which the following words were written. ‘‘O thou! whoever  “ thou mayest be, into whose hands this scroll may happen to fall, remember those  “ words of the Almighty, ‘ This my brother has ninety-nine ewes, and I have only  “ one, and he said to me,—Do intrust her to my care,—which I did, but his words  “ proved false, and he deceived me ; there is no God but God !’* Thou art a king on  “ whom God has lavished his favours, making thee wealthy and powerful on earth,  “and yet, far from being satisfied, thy ambition prompts thee to covet the property of  “ others; and to add to thy spacious gardens a piece of ground belonging to an  “orphan, thereby committing an unlawful act, depriving a defenceless girl of all  “ means of subsistence, and taking advantage of thy power, and the importance of  “ thy situation, to do what is unjust.

"Al-mudhdhafer Ibn Al-afttas, King of Badajoz, was, according to the historian  Ibnu-l-abb4r, of all the monarchs of his time the one who showed the greatest love  for science, and who rewarded the labours of the learned with the most liberal hand.  So great was his knowledge in all the branches of literature, so universal his attain-  ments in the sciences, so ardent his love of all sorts of information, that notwith-  standing his reign was one of continual agitation and danger, owing to the turbulent  times in which he lived, he still found leisure successfully to cultivate all the  sciences, leaving behind him that immense work in fifty volumes which raised  the admiration of both Eastern and Western writers; and in the composition of  which Al-mudhdhafer spared neither trouble nor expense, having previously col-  lected a rich and extensive library for the purpose. His work, indeed, which in  the East is known by the title of Al-mudhdhafert,® from the name of its royal  author, treats on universal science, being a repository of art, science, history,  poetry, literature in general, proverbs, biographical information, and so forth. Al-  mudhdhafer died in the year four hundred and sixty of the Hijra (a. p. 1067-8), and  in the words of Ibnu Hayyédn and Ibnu Bessdm, two authors who have written an  account of his life, he surpassed all the kings of his time in science and in learning,  as well as in virtue and brilliant qualities. Our readers, moreover, must not be  surprised at this, or think that we exaggerate when we say that Al-mudhdhafer’s  work was composed of fifty volumes. No, it is a notorious fact, and were we to  judge by other very voluminous works which are in existence, we should say that  it was the fashion among the Andalusian authors to protract their works to an  enormous length.

" mention.

I have likewise from good  “authority that the cost of each block of marble, whether great or small, found  “in the mountains of Andalus was also nearly the above-mentioned sum; and,  “lastly, it has been repeated on the authority of one of the servants of the  “palace that the total amount of the expenses in the erection of Az-zahra  “amounted yearly to three hundred thousand dinars during the twenty-five  “ years it was building under An-ndssir, namely, from the year three hundred and  “ twenty-five, the epoch of its commencement, till that of three hundred and fifty,  “the time of the death of that Khalif; and that having made the computation  “of the total expenditure which that Sultén underwent he found it amount to  “ fifteen beyt-mdl.?’ The number of doors in the palace of Az-zahré amounted  “to fifteen thousand, counting each flap or fold as one, and all were covered  “ either with plates of iron or sheets of polished brass.” So far Ibnu Hayyén.

" Aw Andalusian historian has said that such were An-ndssir’s passion and taste for Aqueduct of  building that besides the erection of the magnificent palace that we have just de-  scribed, and the considerable additions made to the great mosque, he also undertook  and completed during his reign several public works for the improvement and orna-  ment of his capital. Of this number was a most magnificent aqueduct, which conveyed  excellent water from the mountains of Cordova to the palace of An-na’trah (the water-  wheel), in the western part of the city, by means of tubes geometrically arranged  over arches connected one with another. The waters thus conveyed, in admirable  order, and by dint of extraordinary science, were discharged into a vast reservoir,  on which was a colossal lion of wonderful workmanship, and so beautifully imitated  that the sight of it only was sufficient to cast fear into the hearts of the beholders,  and that none devised by the Sult4ns of former times had been seen equal to it,  either in likeness or in magnificence. It was covered with the purest gold, and  its two eyes were two jewels of inestimable value, which sent forth torrents of  light. The waters of the aqueduct entered into the hind part of this monster, and  then poured out from his mouth into the aforesaid basin, which circumstance,  united to the beautiful appearance of the animal, to its terrible and overawing  aspect, to the two eyes which shone forth as if they belonged to a human creature,  never failed altogether to produce the most extraordinary effect in the minds of  those who beheld it for the first time.

"Az-zhirah. We have to mention another palace and city built by the famous Hajib, Mo-  hammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir, commonly called Al-mansir, although information  respecting it is by no means so abundant with us as we should wish. We  know that it existed at some distance from Cordova on the banks of the Guadal-  quivir, and that it was a most splendid structure, second to none but the palace  of Az-zahr4, built by ’Abdu-r-rahmdn ; but, owing to the circumstance of its being  destroyed by the Berbers, soon after the death of its founder,> during the disastrous  civil wars which brought to the ground the tottering throne of the Khalifs, the  memory of it was soon effaced, and such particulars as have been handed down to  us give but few details.

"I recollect having read in an historical work, the composition of the author of  the Kitdbu-l-azhdr wa-l-anwdr,> which I saw in the library of Fez, the following  anecdote respecting Al-manstr, and the splendour and magnificence with which he  used to surround his person while residing in his palace of Az-zdhirah. There  came once to the court of Al-manstir ambassadors from the most powerful of the  Christian kings of Andalus ; their object was to ascertain the real strength of the  Moslems, and gain, if possible, a knowledge of their internal affairs. No sooner did  Al-mansir hear of their arrival than he issued orders for their suitable enter-  tainment, and began to make preparations previous to their admission to his pre-  sence.

In order, therefore, not to be hindered and disturbed in the study  and cultivation of science, which made the principal business of their lives, they  fled before the Persians, their enemies, and migrated to Andalus, where they had  no sooner arrived than they began to dig canals, and to make cuts from the rivers  for the purpose of irrigation ; to erect bridges and aqueducts, to construct fortresses  and castles, to plant gardens and vines, and to build cities and towns; ploughing  and sowing the land, and raising whatever buildings were deemed necessary for  the pleasure and comfort of the people.

This brings to our recollection a witty answer once  made by a Western Arab to the Prince of believers, Hartin Ar-rashid (the mercy of  God be upon him!)

However, when Roderic arrived in Cordova, the sons of  Wittiza were busily engaged in some distant province collecting troops to march  against the invaders, and he wrote to them to come and join him with their forces, ee  in order to march together against the Arabs; and, cautioning them against the  inconvenience and danger of private feuds at that moment, engaged them to join  him and attack the Arabs in one mass. The sons of Wittiza readily agreed to  Roderic’s proposition, and collecting all their forces came to meet him, and  encamped not far from the village of Shakandah, on the opposite side of the river,°*  and on the south of the palace of Cordova.

" Cordova, informed Mugheyth that the principal people of the city had quitted it and  gone to Toledo, but that a governor had been left behind with a garrison of four  hundred horsemen, besides the invalids and old soldiers.? The shepherd being  further questioned respecting the walls of the city said that they were strong and  high, but that there was a breach in them, which he described. Accordingly, no  sooner were the Moslems enveloped in the shadows of night than they set off  towards the city, and approached its walls, where God Almighty opened to them the  means of success, by sending a providential fall of hail, which prevented the stepping  of the horses from being heard. The Moslems proceeded gently and unnoticed till  they arrived on the banks of the river,® which they crossed, finding themselves then  at a distance of only thirty cubits, or perhaps less, from the walls. Owing to the  squalls of rain, and the cold of the night, the sentries, neglecting their duties, were  not on the walls keeping guard, a circumstance which allowed the Moslems to arrive  unheard and unmolested at the foot of the battlements; they then attempted to  scale the walls, but failed in their attempt by not finding a place to fix the  ladders. In this difficulty they returned to the shepherd, and asked him to lead  them to the breach he had mentioned ; this the man did, but it was also found upon  trial not to be of easy ascent. However, this was after some time obtained by  means of a fig tree, growing close to the walls, the branches of which afforded the  means of ascending. One of their strongest men mounted the tree, whence he  succeeded in gaining the top of the breach. Mugheyth then unfolded his turban,  and gave one end of it to the man, who by means of it succeeded in helping others  on until a considerable number of Moslems gained the summit of the wall.  Mugheyth, who remained on horseback at the foot of the battlements, then com-  manded the assailant party to rush upon the guard within the city. This order was  quickly obeyed by the Moslems, who surprised and killed many of the garrison,  and, breaking open the gate, let in Mugheyth and the rest of his men, who soon got  possession of the city. This being done, Mugheyth, with his guides, hastened  towards the palace of the governor, who, having received intelligence of the entry of  the Moslems, fled with his guards, four hundred in number, and betook himself to a  church situate at the west® of the city, and fortified himself in it.

However, the two armies engaged  near the lake or gulf ;®’ they fought resolutely on both sides till the right and  left wings of Roderic’s army, under the command of the sons of Wittiza, gave  way. The centre, in which Roderic was, still held firm for awhile, and made  the fate of the battle uncertain for some time; they fled at last, and Roderic  before them. From that moment the rout became general, and the Moslems  followed with ardour the pursuit of the scattered bands, inflicting death wherever  they went. Roderic disappeared in the midst of the battle, and no certain intel-  ligence was afterwards received of him; it is true that some Moslems found his  favourite steed, a milk-white horse, bearing a saddle of gold sparkling with rubies,  plunged in the mud of the river, as also one of his sandals, adorned with rubies  and emeralds, but the other was never found ; nor was Roderic, although diligently  searched for, ever discovered either dead or alive, a circumstance which led the  Moslems to believe that he perished in the stream’; indeed there are not wanting  authors who give it as certain that he died in this manner, and that, while trying  to cross the stream, the weight of his armour” prevented him from struggling  against the current, and he was drowned ; but God only knows what became of  him.”",book_4,chapter_3,True," reached a small elevation whence he had a commanding view of the whole camp.  however, he had not remained long in his place of observation before he was  discovered by some moslems, who pursued him, but the christian fled before  them and escaped through the swiftness of his horse. arrived at the christian  camp he addressed roderic in the following words. ‘‘ these people, o king!

Accordingly, no  sooner were the Moslems enveloped in the shadows of night than they set off  towards the city, and approached its walls, where God Almighty opened to them the  means of success, by sending a providential fall of hail, which prevented the stepping  of the horses from being heard. The Moslems proceeded gently and unnoticed till  they arrived on the banks of the river,® which they crossed, finding themselves then  at a distance of only thirty cubits, or perhaps less, from the walls. Owing to the  squalls of rain, and the cold of the night, the sentries, neglecting their duties, were  not on the walls keeping guard, a circumstance which allowed the Moslems to arrive  unheard and unmolested at the foot of the battlements; they then attempted to  scale the walls, but failed in their attempt by not finding a place to fix the  ladders. In this difficulty they returned to the shepherd, and asked him to lead  them to the breach he had mentioned ; this the man did, but it was also found upon  trial not to be of easy ascent. However, this was after some time obtained by  means of a fig tree, growing close to the walls, the branches of which afforded the  means of ascending. One of their strongest men mounted the tree, whence he  succeeded in gaining the top of the breach.

This order was  quickly obeyed by the Moslems, who surprised and killed many of the garrison,  and, breaking open the gate, let in Mugheyth and the rest of his men, who soon got  possession of the city. This being done, Mugheyth, with his guides, hastened  towards the palace of the governor, who, having received intelligence of the entry of  the Moslems, fled with his guards, four hundred in number, and betook himself to a  church situate at the west® of the city, and fortified himself in it.

"According to Ibnu Hayyén and other historians, when Térik had defeated the Miss preveres  entire forces of the Gothic empire, with King Roderic at their head, on the banks ” so  of the Guadalete, he hastened to communicate to his master Misa Ibn Nosseyr |  the news of the signal victory which God Almighty had granted to his arms.  But, instead of congratulating himself upon his freedman’s success, the Arabian  Amir grew jealous and spiteful, and, fearing lest, by prosecuting the conquest,  Tarik should take all the spoil and the glory to himself, and leave none for him,  sent Tarik a severe reprimand because he had attacked without his orders, together  with an injunction not to move from where he was until he should join him.  Accordingly, having made a few hasty preparations, he crossed over to Andalus,  leaving his eldest son ’Abdullah to command at Cairwan in his stead, and, taking  with him Habib Ibn ’Abdah Al-fehri, and three of his other sons, Merwan,  *Abdu-l-a’la, and ’Abdu-l-’aziz, landed on the coast of Andalus in the month of  Ramadhén of the year ninety-three (August, a.p. 712), or, according to others,  in the month of Rejeb of the same year (June, a.p. 712).

He sailed from Ceuta, and, avoiding the mountain  where Tarik had landed, disembarked at a spot which was since called after him  Jebal-Misa* (the mountain of Misa). Thence he proceeded to Algesiras, where  he is said to have expressed his wish not to follow the same route which Tarik had  taken. Some of Ilydn’s people,” who served him as guides, then told him, ‘‘ We  “* will take thee a shorter road than his, and conduct thee to cities more populous  “‘ and wealthy than those which he has conquered ; cities, too, which no conqueror  “‘ has yet subdued, but which, if such be God’s will, will surrender to thee.”  Delighted with this account Misa followed his guides, for the idea of having been  outstripped by Térik in the conquest annoyed him much. They led him along the  coast of Shidhinah (Sidonia),*° which place he took by storm, the inhabitants  imploring his mercy ; thence he proceeded to Karmtinah (Carmona),*' the strongest  city in Andalus, and the best calculated for defence against a besieging enemy, but  he gained it through a stratagem which he devised.

Owing to this the city withstood for some  time** the attacks of Misa, but at last that general entered it by force of  arms, and the barbarians fled to Bajah (Beja).

This city was of considerable size and great  strength; in it were the remains of palaces, temples of vast size and exquisite  workmanship; and other public buildings. Musa laid siege to it, but the people,  being brave and determined, repulsed the Moslems several times with great loss.
