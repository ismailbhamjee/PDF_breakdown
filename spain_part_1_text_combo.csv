"    HISTORY    OF    THE MOHAMMEDAN DYNASTIES IN SPAIN.    BOOK I.  CHAP. I.    Etymology of the name of Andalue—Climate—Geographical Divisions—Dimensions of the Country—  Shape—Ancient divisions—First settlere—Vandals—A fricans—Romans—lIshbin, son of Titus—Bisht-  ilikit—Goths—Iskhander.    In the name of God, whose assistance we humbly beseech and implore, we shall  begin by describing the Island of Andalus,—a country whose excellences are so  numerous, and of such a kind, that they cannot easily be contained within the limits  of abook, and that no words can be found sufficiently strong to give an idea of  them. For our part, we consider Andalus as the prize of the race won by the  horsemen who, at the utmost speed of their chargers, subdued the regions of the    East and West.   Respecting the etymology of its name different opinions prevail ; some authors, Etymology of  like Ibnu Sa’id,' derive it from Andalus, son of Tubal, son of Yafeth, son of Nuh, « Andalus.”  who settled in it, and gave it his name, in like manner as his brother Sebt, son  of Yafeth, peopled the opposite land, and gave his name to the city of Sebtah  (Ceuta). Ibnu Ghélib? follows the same opinion, but makes Andalus to be the son  of Y4feth. Ibnu Hayyén,? Ibnu Khaldin,* and others, derive it from Andalosh,®  a nation of barbarians who settled there. This latter opinion seems the most  probable ; but God is all-knowing.   The country of Andalus (may God restore it entire to the Moslems !) has been Cimate.  described both by native and foreign writers in the most pompous terms. The  Wizir Lisénu-d-din® Ibnu-l-khattib, (may God show him mercy!) in one of his  historical works, says as follows: ‘‘ God Almighty has distinguished this our  “country by endowing it with gentle hills and fertile plains, sweet and wholesome   VOL. 1. D     Geographical  position.    18 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    “ food, a great number of useful animals, plenty of fruits, abundance of waters,  “comfortable dwellings, good clothing, beautiful vases, and utensils of every  “* description ; fine weapons, a pure and wholesome air, a slow succession of the  ‘* seasons of the year. He has also endowed its inhabitants with great aptitude for  “« the sciences and the arts of domestic life ; acuteness of mind, quickness of intel-  “ lect ; courage, ardent love of every thing which is noble, and many other brilliant  “« qualities, which are not to be found united in people of any other country.”   Abt ’Obeyd-illah Al-bekri Al-andalusi? compares his native country to Shém  (Syria) for purity of air and sweetness of waters, to Yemen for mildness of tempera-  ture, which is every where the same, to Hind (India) for drugs and aromatic plants,  to Al-ahwéz® for the magnitude of its snakes, to China for mines and precious  stones, to ’Aden for the number and security of its coasts and harbours.   Abi ’A’mir As-salémi,® in his work entitled ‘ Durru-I-kildyid wa ghurruru-l-  fawdyid, (pearls of the necklaces, and stars of useful things,) says that Andalus  belongs to the climate of Sham (Syria) ; that which, of all those into which the  earth is divided, is reckoned the best and most temperate, which has the finest land  and waters, and which abounds most in animals, fruits, and productions of all kinds :  “ that climate,” he adds, ‘‘ occupies a middle place among the other climates, and  ‘is therefore considered the best, it being well known that the most preferable  “« portion of any thing is that which is in the middle.”   The Sheikh Ahmed Ibn Mohammed Ibn Misa Ar-rézi!® says that Andalus  is situated at the extremity of the fourth climate towards the West, and that  all learned authors agree in describing it as a country with delightful valleys,  and fertile lands, rich in all sorts of agricultural productions, watered by many  large rivers, and abounding in springs of the sweetest waters. It contains but  few wild beasts, or venomous reptiles ; the air in winter is mild, and the coolest  breezes temper the heat of summer. The climate is so temperate all the year  round as to make the transition from one season to another almost imperceptible ;  in fact, it may be said that a perpetual spring reigns all over Andalus, this  being the reason why most of the fruits of earth grow in all seasons, and the  crops succeed one another without interruption ; owing, too, to the different  qualities of the soil, the same produce may be obtained all the year round in  various provinces of Andalus ; as, for instance, on the coast and the lands adjoining  to it all fruits of the earth are very forward, while in the Thagher™ and its  districts, and especially on the mountains, where the air is colder, they are, on  the contrary, very backward. Most of its fruits, also, partake of a flavour and  beauty which are not common to those of other countries.’?   That Andalus is situate in the fourth climate appears sufficiently demonstrated     CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 19    by the words of the geographer Idrisi, as quoted by Ibnu Sa’id: ‘‘ Andalus,”  says that author, ‘‘has no portion of its territory within the third climate, but  “the fourth passes by its southern coast, and includes Cordova, Seville, Murcia,  “and Valencia; thence it goes towards Sicily, encloses this and other islands in  “the neighbourhood, leaving the sun at the back. The fifth passes by Toleytoleh  “ Toledo), Sarakostah (Saragossa) and the environs; then by Arghon’* (Aragon),  “at the southern extremity of which is the city of Barshelénah (Barcelona), thence  “it proceeds to Rome and the country subject to that city, divides the Bahru-l-  “ Banddikeh (Gulf of Venice) into two parts, and comprises Costantiniyeh the  “ great (Constantinople) and its territory, leaving behind the planet called  “ Az-zahrah (Venus). The sixth passes by the northern coast of Andalus,  “that which is washed by the waters of the circumambient sea, includes part of  “ Castile* and Portugal,'® a great portion of the country of the Franks, Georgia,  “and the country of the Sclavonians and Russians, leaving behind the planet  “called ’Ottdrid (Mercury). The seventh comprises the circumambient sea to  “the north of Andalus, the island called Alinkilterrah'® (England) and others  “in the neighbourhood, as well as the remainder of the countries of the Franks  “and Sclavonians, Georgia, and Berjén.'""""—According to Al-beyhaki'® the island  “ of Tili,’® and the two islands of Al-ajbél? (Norway) and An-nisé”! (Amazones)  “and several other districts of Russia, fall within the limits of this seventh and  “ last climate, which has the moon at its back.”   Respecting the name of Al-jeztrah (the island) by which all authors agree in  designating Andalus, it must not be understood by it that that country is, properly  speaking, an island ; since it is well known to be joined to the great land (continent)  by the chain of mountains called Al-bort™ (Pyrenees), but the Arabs in general  all by this name all those countries which are surrounded by water on every side  but one, and this being the case with Andalus, it was called Al-jeztrah. Two  principal seas wash the shores of Andalus; on the northern and western side  the circumambient sea (Ocean), on the southern and eastern the sea of Shdm  (Mediterranean). By the sea of Shém we understand that sea which begins at  the lower extremity of Andalus, at a place on its south-western coast called  Jeziratu-l-khadhrdé® (Algesiras), between Tangiers in Africa and the coast of  Andalus, taking from thence its course towards Syria. The width of this sea  at the said spot is generally stated at eighteen’ miles ; which is also the dis-  tance between Jezirah Tarif* (Tarifa) and Kasr Masmiidah* (Alcasar), near  Ceuta. Between these two last mentioned places there was once a bridge,  which, according to common opinion, Iskhander (Alexander) ordered to be built,     Dimensions of  the country.    20 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Boox 1.    that he might pass from Andalus into the opposite land of Africa. But of this  more will be said in the course of this narrative.   The narrow sea thus emergmg from between the two coasts was called  Bahru-z-sokdk™ (the narrow sea). Although the distance between the two  shores is so small, as we have already observed, this strait is nevertheless  very difficult to be passed, owing to the continual agitation of its waves, and  the frightful whirlpools occasioned by the meeting of the two seas. We have  said that the width of the straits at the narrowest part was eighteen miles ; it  is double that width at Ceuta, and from thence the sea begins to grow wider  and wider, until at some places it reaches 800 miles in breadth, or perhaps  more ; as happens at Stir (Tyre), on the coast of Syria. This sea contains  many islands, which some geographers estimate to be twenty-eight in number,  and of which the principal are Sicily, Malta, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, Corfu, and  so forth.   The dimensions of the country are differently stated: Al-mes’idi,” in his  “« Golden Meadows,” says, ‘‘ Andalus is very thickly peopled ; nearly two months  ‘of continual marching are required to traverse it from one end to the other.  “Tt contains nearly forty cities of the first rank.” Ibn Alisa’ *® agrees with  Al-mes’idi in this particular ; his opinion is that the length of Andalus from  Ariénah ® (Narbonne) to Ishbénah (Lisbon) is equal to the distance that a horse-  man well mounted may travel in sixty days; but this is decidedly an error, first  of all because Narbonne is, by that author, placed within the limits of Andalus,  while it is evident that it belongs to another country; and secondly, because the  distance between those two cities is much overrated, as most of the authors who  have written on the subject estimate it at only one month and a half’s march.   Tbnu Sa’id, however, endeavours to adjust the difference by supposing that  Tbn Alisa’ meant a horseman not well mounted, and travelling by short stages,  and that his text was vitiated by the copyist. He himself adopts the computation  of the Sherif Idrisi as that which deserves more credit, namely, that the length  of Andalus is of one month’s march. The same opinion is followed by Al-hijéri,°  who, having, as he informs us, consulted with well informed and trustworthy  travellers on the subject, learnt from them that a little more than a month’s  good travelling was sufficient to traverse Andalus in its whole length.   The last mentioned author (Al-hijéri) estimates the distance from Lisbon to  Al-hdjiz*' (the Pyrenees) at more than one thousand miles, but whoever wishes  to obtain more information on the subject may consult Ibnu Sa’id, who has  treated the matter at full length.     cHaP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 21    The width of Andalus measured at the top, towards the north-east, is forty  miles, this being the length of those mountain barriers which separate it from  the country of the Franks, and which stretch along from the Mediterranean to  the Ocean ; if measured at the centre, as for instance drawing a line to pass by  Toledo, it is sixteen days’ march.   Its shape, according to all accounts, is that of a triangle; much difference, Shape.  however, exists among geographers respecting its north-eastern*? angle, namely,  that which falls in the neighbourhood of Narbonne: some authors, like Ahmed  Ibn Mohammed Ar-rézi and Ibnu Hayyén, placing it in Narbonne, a city imme-  diately facing Bordhil (Bourdeaux)** on the north-east ; while others only place  it in the neighbouring districts. But this, as well as other points concerning  the topography of Andalus, has been decided by the Sherif Idrisi, an author  in whose accounts implicit reliance may be placed, not only because he traversed  that country in all directions, navigated its seas, and surveyed its coasts, but  also on account of the great knowledge he acquired in the science of geography.   The words of Ar-r4zi on the subject are as follows: ‘‘ The shape of Andalus  “is that of a triangle, the angles of which are placed, one at Kadis (Cadiz), where  “stands the famous tower with an idol at the top, or rather at that spot on the  “extreme south where the Mediterranean begins, directing its course to the east.  “The other to the east of Andalus, between the cities of Narbonne and Bordhil,  “ which are now in the hands of the Franks, falling diametrically opposite to the  “two islands of Mayércah (Mallorca) and Mendércah (Menorca), and at an equal  “distance from the Ocean and Mediterranean, which in those parts are separated  “only by an intervening tract of land called Al-abwdb (the Gates), being gorges  “or passes which serve as a communication between the island of Andalus and  “the great land (continent) of which Afranjah (France) forms part. At this  “ place the distance between the two seas is of two days’ march, Narbonne being  “on the coast of the Mediterranean, and Bordhil facing the Ocean. The third  “angle is placed in the north-west, in that spot of the country of Jalikiyah  “ (Galicia), where there is a mountain near the sea, and on it a very high tower,  “with an idol on the top, similar to that of Kadis, and looking towards Birtdéniah  “ (Britain).”   Tbnu Sa’id says, ‘“ having once asked the opinion of several men learned in  “these matters, I was told that Idrisi’s statement seemed the most worthy of  “being received, namely, that neither Narbonne nor Bordhil were within the  “limits of Andalus, and therefore that the angle in the east must be placed  “between the cities of Barshelénah (Barcelona) and Tarkénah (Tarragona), at  “a spot called Wéddi-Zanlakalto,* close to the mountain barrier which there     Ancient divi-  sions.    22 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book 1.    * divides Andalus from the continent, where many different languages are spoken.  ‘“‘ These mountains have several passes or gates, which a Grecian king* ordered  “to be opened in the rock with fire, vinegar, and iron, for before his time there  ‘* was no communication whatsoever by land between Andalus and the continent.  “The said gates or passes face that part of the Bahru-z-zokdk (Mediterranean)  “‘ which divides the two islands of Mallorca and Menorca, this being a fact which  ** is corroborated by the assertions of all travellers in those districts. The second  “and third angles are placed by Idrisi in the same situation that the authors  “before mentioned agree in giving them, viz., in the promontory called ’Ajma’u-  “ [-bahrdnt,® near the city of Shant Yakéh (Santiago) in Galicia, where the  ‘“‘ famous beacon stands; and in the mountain of Al-aghar,*”7 near Cadiz, the  “‘ site of the well-known tower which has an idol on the top of it. Near this  “* mountain, in a south-west direction, is the spot where the Bahru-z-zokdk (narrow  “ sea) emerges from the Ocean, and from whence, after washing the southern and  “* eastern coasts of Andalus, it reaches one side of the Pyrenees.”   Andalus was divided, following the words of Ar-rézi, into two parts :—Andalus  Al-gharbé (Western), and Andalus Ash-sharki (Eastern), the division having been  made according to the prevailing winds, the fall of the rains, and the course of  the rivers. The Gharbi (weStern) was that part of Andalus whose rivers empty  their waters into the Western Ocean, and where it rains when the winds blow  from the western quarter ; the Sharkt (eastern), which was also called Al-aksd,  or the remote, being, on the contrary, that whose rivers flow to the east, and  where it rains when the easterly winds blow. The dividing line between these  two districts was placed by Ar-r4zi in the mountains of the Basques (Al-bashkans)  towards the east, from thence drawing a line to the city of Santa Maria,** then  inclining a little towards the district of Agreda, in the neighbourhood of Toledo,  and at last approaching that part of the Mediterranean which washes the shores of  the modern Cartagena, which belongs to the district of Lércah (Lorca). All the  countries falling eastward of this line were therefore comprised within the limits  of Eastern Andalus, and those to the west within those of Western Andalus. The  boundaries of the latter were: to the north-west, and west, the Ocean; to the south  the Western Sea, whence the Mediterranean, which the ancients called also  Bahr Tirren,® issues to take its course towards Syria. Bahr Tirren means the  sea that divides the globe: it was called also the Great Sea.‘   Abi Bekr ’Abdullah Ibn ’Abdi-l-hakam, known by the surname of Ibn An-  nadhdhém,""' treating of the said division, adds a few particulars which we repeat  here for the sake of information. ‘‘ Andalus,” he says, ‘‘ was divided into two  “« parts by ancient geographers, who observed that whenever winds from the west     CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 23    “ prevailed, it ‘rained much in Western Andalus, and there was drought in the  “ Eastern; and, on the contrary, when the wind blew from the east, rain fell  “in abundance in the Eastern, and the Western was dry and parched. The  “same difference was observed respecting the course of rivers, for all the rivers  “in Western Andalus flow from the east to the west, forcing their way through  “ those mountains *? that traverse it in the middle, and are only a branch detached  “from the mountains in the north-western districts. In the Eastern all rivers  “flow from west to east, for although some of them take a more southern  “ direction, yet they all spring from the said mountains in the centre of Andalus,  “and discharge their waters into the Mediterranean, which goes on to Syria,  “and is known also by the name of Bahru-r-rimi (the sea of Greece). As to  “the rivers of the north-western districts** (Al-Juf), including those of the  “country of the Galicians, and its dependencies, all empty themselves into the  ‘ preat ocean (Atlantic), which washes the shores of those countries.”   The same author (Ibn An-nadhdhém) says that the first people who, after the First setters  deluge, settled in Andalus, according to the accounts of foreign writers, were a ‘*""""""""*  nation called Andalush, who gave their name to the country. This word Andalush  being in the course of time corrupted by the Arabs, who changed the letter shin  into sin, it was written and pronounced Andalus, which is the present name of  this country.“ Those barbarians came to Andalus and settled in it; and their  numbers having increased considerably, in the course of time they filled the whole  country and established different kingdoms in it. But being idolaters (Majis), |  and otherwise inclined to depravity and corruption, they lived in entire disobedience :  to the divine precepts, until God Almighty, perceiving their obstinacy, withdrew \  the rain from them, and the whole country was thereby exposed to the most  dreadful sterility ; fountains sank into the bowels of the earth, rivers altered their  course, trees dried up, plants withered, and both men and beasts experienced  the most raging thirst, owing to which most of the inhabitants perished, with the  exception of a few who escaped from death by flying into distant lands. Thus  freed from these people, Andalus became a desert, and continued so for one  hundred years,** for that great calamity was not confined to any part of its territory,  but ravaged the whole country from the Pyrenees to the furthest extremity in the  Western or Green Sea. The reign of ‘the Andalush had lasted one hundred and  odd years.   At last, after Andalus had remained in that state for the said period of years, Africans.  God Almighty was pleased to send other settlers; these were certain people  whom the king of Africa had banished his dominions, because of their having  excited sedition in his state, and instigated his subjects to revolt against him.     Romans.    24 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK 1.    After making war against them until they were nearly exterminated, he caused  the few who remained to be embarked on board some vessels, and giving them  for commander an officer of the name of Batrikus, he allowed them to go whither  they pleased. Batrikus and his men first cast anchor at a place on the western  shore of Andalus, and settled at Cadiz. Having afterwards advanced into the  interior of the country, they found that, owing to the fall of rain, the land had  recovered its former aspect, the fields were adorned with verdure, the rivers flowed,  the fountains ran, and the trees were covered with leaves. Encouraged by what  they saw, they proceeded still farther, spread themselves about the country,  extended their settlements, built cities and towns, and increased their numbers  by marriage. However, they settled in preference in that part of the country  hetween the place of their landing in the west, and the country of the Franks  in the east, and appointed kings to rule over them and administer their affairs.  Their religion was the same as that of their predecessors in the country, that is,  they worshipped idols. They fixed their capital at Talikah (Italica), a city now  in ruins, and which once belonged to the district of Ishbiliah (Seville). But,  after a period of one hundred and fifty-seven years, during which eleven kings  of that race reigned over Andalus, God Almighty permitted that they should all  be annihilated by the barbarians of Rome, who invaded and conquered the country.  “ After the defeat and destruction of the Africans, the empire of Andalus  “ devolved to the people of Rome and their king Ishbén, son of Titus, after  ‘‘whom Andalus was called Ishbdniah. Some authors assert that the real name  “of this king was Isbahdén, and that he was called so on account of his being  “born in the city of Isfahén; only that the barbarians corrupted it and called  “him Ishban ; but, be this as it may, certain it is that this king Ishbin founded  “ Seville, and called it after his name Ishbaniah, which in after time became also  ‘the appellation of the whole country, owing to the numerous ruins of works  “‘ and edifices erected by him, which are still visible in many parts of Andalus.  “This king Ishbén is generally held as one of the conquerors of the earth. He  “‘ invaded Andalus, and by the favour of God, who gave victory to his arms, he  “made war against the inhabitants, dispersed their armies, slaughtered and cap-  “tured their men, and besieged them at last in their capital, the city of Italica.  “* The Africans made a most desperate resistance, and, the place being very strong,  ‘held out a considerable time, until Ishban, impatient of the delay, caused the  “city of Seville to be built opposite to Italica, and, pressing on the siege, took it  “by storm. By the taking of Italica, which he ordered to be demolished, and  “its marbles and effects carried to his new city, the whole of Andalus submitted  “to Ishban, who, having completed the building of Seville, chose it for his court     CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 25    “and residence, established his authority permanently, increased his armies, and  “pursued his career of conquest. Scarcely two years had elapsed when he  “sailed from Seville with a fleet, attacked Ilia‘” which is the same as Al-Kods  (Jerusalem) the illustrious, plundered and de. ~lished it, killed one hundred  “thousand Jews, spared one hundred thousand, an. <aused its marbles and  “effects to be transported to Andalus. This Ishb4n further subdued all his  “enemies, and his reign was very prosperous.” The preceding account is taken,  word for word, from Ibn An-nadhdh4m. We may add to it what a certain historian  says to prove the taking of Jerusalem, although he attributes the conquest to  another king, namely, that most of the wonderful things which the Moslems  found among the spoils of Andalus at the time of the conquest, such as the  table of Suleymén, son of Datid, (upon whom be peace!) which Térik Ibn  Zeyad found in a temple at Toledo, and the pearl necklace taken by Misa Ibn  Nosseyr from the church at Merida, as well as a great many other precious objects  and jewels, of which a more ample description will be given hereafter, were part  of the share in the spoil which, at the taking of Jerusalem by Bokht Nasser,  fell to the lot of a king of Spain, whose name was Beridn,** and who was present  at the conquest of that city. The whole of these precious objects had been in  former times the property of the Prophet Suleyman, son of. Daiid, for whose use  the Jinn had constructed them. How the contradictory accounts of these two  historians are to be adjusted we cannot decide, unless Ishbén and Beridn be the  same person: God only is all-knowing.   To return to Ishb4n. Ibnu Hayyén, in his historical work entitled “ the book tshbén.  “of the seeker of information respecting the History of the Barbarians,”“? says  that this Ishban was once a very poor man from the lower ranks of society, and  as he was one day engaged in ploughing a field with his oxen, Al-khadher ® (on  whom be peace !) appeared before him, and addressed him thus: “‘ O Ishban, thou  “ art destined to perform great deeds; thou shalt reign, and thy fame shall spread  “far and wide. When thou takest Ilia, be kind to the descendants of the  “ Prophet.”” And Ishb4n answered, ‘“ Thou art jesting, no doubt, or I am not  ‘“‘ the person thou meanest, for I am a poor and weak man, and am obliged to  “hire out my services to gain a living, and certainly it is not for people of my  “class that the empire is reserved.” “‘ No matter,” replied Al-khadher, ‘“ what  “‘T tell thee is the plain truth; it is predestined, and it shall happen: He has  “decreed it who has the power to change that dry rod thou bearest in thy  “hand into a green bough.” Ishban looked, when lo! it suddenly turned  green, flourished, and was covered with leaves. Ishb4n was astounded when he  saw the miracle ; he tried to speak, but his tongue clove to his mouth; he looked   VOL. I. E     Bishtilikét or  Visigoths.    Goths.    e    26 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Boox r.    for Al-khadher, but Al-khadher was gone, he had vanished from his sight. How-  ever, the words of the Prophet remaining deeply impressed on his mind, he began  to turn over what had been said to him, and the result was that he soon after-  wards left his master’s service, and associated with men of courage and deter-  mination, amongst whom he became conspicuous for his prowess, until he arrived  at power and performed what has been related. His reign lasted twenty years,  and he transmitted the empire to his posterity, of whom fifty-five kings ruled  over Andalus.   After this the country was invaded by other barbarians coming from Rome,  and called Bishtilikat,** who, with their king Talubush,*? son of Beytah, at their  head, arrived in Andalus, after conquering on their way the country of the  Franks, which they governed by their prefects. This took place about the  time of the resurrection of the Massih (anointed), son of Mariim, (on whom be  peace!) They conquered the whole of Andalus, and fixed their court at Merida,  remaining in undisturbed possession of the country during the reign of twenty-  seven monarchs, until they themselves were subdued by the Goths, who with  their king at their head invaded Andalus, and separated it for ever from the  empire of Rome.   The Goths fixed their capital at Tolétalah (Toledo). However, Ishbiliah still  continued to be the abode of the sciences, and the dwelling-place of the most  noble among the Ishbdnians. About this time the Apostles sent by ""Isa Al-massih  (the anointed) began to wander about the world, calling the people to his  religion. In some countries their words were heard, and thousands of people  embraced the religion which they preached ; in others they were unheard, and  put to death. Among those who adopted their creed, and honoured the Apostles,  was Khoshandinus* (Constantine), king of the Goths, who not only embraced  Christianity, but called upon his subjects to do the same. This Khoshandinus is held  by the Christians as the greatest king they ever had, and as the most accomplished,  upright, virtuous, and wise monarch that can be imagined. It was he who  introduced Christianity into his dominions, where it has flourished ever since,  and used to decide in all law cases with the assistance of the Gospels, those books  upon which various opinions prevail, as also upon their writers or compilers.  Several kings of the posterity of Khoshandinus reigned after him in Andalus,  until that country was finally subdued by the Arabs, by whose means God  Almighty was pleased to make manifest the superiority of Islam over every  other religion.’   The number of kings of Gothic descent who reigned over Andalus ‘is stated  in the old Christian chronicles to have been thirty-six, from Atdnduinus,“ who     CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 27    reigned in the fifth year of the Emperor Filibus,* in 407 of the era of Safar,**  from which the barbarians compute their years, to Ludherik, their last king,  who reigned in 749% of the said era; and in whose time the Arabs conquered  Andalus and overthrew the Gothic empire: their domination, moreover, is said  to have lasted 342 years.   However, there are not wanting authors who make of the Goths and the  Bishtilikaét only one nation, but the generality think, as we have said, that they  were distinct people, that the latter were the barbarians of Rome, that they fixed  their court at Merida, and that the kings of their race were twenty-seven in  number ; that the Goths came afterwards, subdued the country, and made the  city of Toledo the seat of their empire. All agree, however, in stating the number  of their kings to be thirty-six. The Goths, according to Ar-r4zi, are the sons  of Yajuj, son of Y4feth, son of Nuh; others give them a different origin.   Before leaving the subject of the ancient history of Andalus, we deem it proper  to transcribe here the words of the K4di-l-kod4 Ibnu Khaldin Al-hadhrami,**  in his great historical work. ‘‘ The opposite land,” he says, ‘‘ which the barbarians  “call Andalush, is inhabited by various nations of western Franks, among which  “the most powerful and numerous are the Jalalcah (Galicians). Hundreds of  “vears before the manifestation of Islam, the Goths, after fighting many battles  “with the Latins, laid siege to their capital, the city of Rome ; after this, peace  ‘was made between them, one of the conditions being that the Goths should  “go to Andalus ; and they accordingly went to that country and took possession  “of it. When the Greeks and Latins embraced Christianity, they induced the  “nations of Franks and Goths who dwelt beyond them in the west to do the  “same, and they accordingly became Christians. The Goths, who had possession  “of Andalus, established their capital in Toledo ; but it was not always so, for in  “ the course of time their kings resided by turns in Seville, Cordova, or Merida,  “besides the above-mentioned city. Their dominion lasted for nearly 400 years,  “until God Almighty was pleased to spread Isl4m and conquest over their  “country. Their king at that time was named Ludherik, an appellation generally  “given by the Goths to their kings, as the Romans call their emperor Kaysar  “ (Cesar), and the Sicilians name their king Jerjiz.” ©   If we are to believe the ancient traditions, Iskhander (Alexander) must also have Iskhander  ""resided. in Andalus ; the remains, too, of a bridge erected by him, between Tangiers fodalue.  and Algesiras, are reported by Idrisi as still existing in his time. The building  of the bridge originated thus: It is generally asserted that, in times of old, the  Mediterranean was a lake surrounded by land on every side, like the sea of     28 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    Tabaristén (the Caspian sea), whose waters have no communication whatsoever  with those of other seas, and that Andalus and the opposite land of Africa were  joined together so as to form only one continent, owing to which the people  of the remote West (Maghrebu-l-aksa) were continually making incursions into  Andalus, and visiting its inhabitants with destruction and war. On the arrival  of Iskhander in Andalus, the people appeared before him, and humbly besought  him that he would put a stop to the hostile incursions of their neighbours, upon  which Iskhander, having taken the subject into consideration, called together  his architects and geometricians, and bid them appear in his presence on the  spot now occupied by Bahru-z-zok4k (Straits of Gibraltar). He then commanded  them to measure the level of the two seas (the Ocean and Mediterranean), which  being done, the first (the Ocean) was found to be a little the higher. This being  reported to Iskhander, he issued immediate orders for the demolition of all the  cities which stood on the coast of the Mediterranean, enjoining at the same time  that they should be rebuilt farther into the country on more elevated situations.  He next caused a deep trench or canal to be dug between Tangiers and Andalus,  and the digging was carried so deep into the earth that the crests of the mountains  of the lower world became visible.’ When the excavation was completed, a  wharf,” of great dimensions, and built with stone and mortar, an admirable work  of art, was erected all along the coast of Andalus, measuring in length twelve  miles, the distance which then separated the two seas. Another wharf of similar  dimensions was constructed along the coast.of Tangiers, and the space left between  the two was six miles, which is exactly the width of the straits at that spot. This  being done, he caused another great excavation to be made on the side of the  Ocean, and, when every thing was ready, the waters of the great sea (Ocean) were  let into the excavated space between the two wharfs, but with such a fury did they  rush into the Mediterranean that its bed was filled, the neighbouring countries  were inundated, many cities were submerged, and thousands of people perished in  the waves. The waters covered both the wharfs, and rose to a height of eleven  ells. The wharf nearest to Andalus is sometimes visible at low water, when it  looks like a great parallel line; the inhabitants of the two islands® call it Al-  kantarah (the bridge). As to the African one, it is no where visible, having been  completely swallowed up by the waves, which inundated on both sides a piece  of ground measuring twelve miles, and were only checked in their progress by  the mountains on either side. The ports in this strait are, on the side of Africa,  Kasru-l-majéz (Alcasar), Tangiers, and Ceuta; on the side of Andalus, Jebel Tarik  (Gibraltar), Jezirah Tarif (Tarifa), Jeziratu-l-khadhré (Algesiras), and others.

We shall now pass to the description of some of the principal cities of Andalus ;  but before engaging in this we deem it necessary to state, that, owing to the plan we  have adopted in writing this work, it may happen that in transcribing or extracting  the accounts of different historians some facts are repeated, and others entirely  contradicted ; but let our excuse be that we have been obliged to connect, one with  another, the narratives of writers of all countries and ages.",book_1,chapter_1
"    Cordova.    30 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book |.    CHAPTER II.    Division of Andalus into three great districts—The central—Cordova—Granada—Toledo—Malaga—  Almeria—Jaen.    Let the reader know that the Island of Andalus, (may God Almighty restore  it entire to the Moslems!) was divided into three great districts, the central, the  eastern, and the western.' The central comprised many cities of the first order,  and which might be called kingdoms, as their jurisdiction extended over populous  districts and large governments, as, for instance, Cordova, Granada, Malaga,  Toledo, Jaen, Almeria.   Among the great cities of Andalus, Cordova has no doubt the preference. Its  mosque, of which we shall treat elsewhere, and the famous bridge called Al-jezr,?  built, according to Ibnu Hayyan, in the Khalifate of ""Omar Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz, and  under the direction of the governor who then administered the affairs of Andalus?  in his name, are objects which have occupied the imagination and wit of the poets.  Amongst others, an Andalusian doctor has said—   “Cordova surpasses all other cities on earth in four principal things: its  ‘“‘ bridge over the Guadalquivir, its great mosque, the city of Az-zahra, and  ‘‘ the sciences therein cultivated.”   The following description occurs in the Al-mishab of Ibnu-l-hijéri:—‘‘ Cordova  “‘ was, during the reign of the Beni Merwan, the cupola of Islam, the meeting place  “ of the learned, the court of the Sultans of the family of Umeyyah, and the re-  “‘ sidence of the most illustrious tribes of Yemen and Ma’d. Students from all  “parts of the world flocked thither at all times to learn the sciences of which  ‘« Cordova was the most noble repository, and to derive knowledge from the mouth  ‘* of the doctors and ulemas who swarmed in it. Cordova is said to have been  “* to Andalus what the head is to the body. Its river is one of the finest in the  “* world, now gliding slowly through level lawns, or winding softly across emerald  “ fields sprinkled with flowers, and serving it instead of robes; now flowing     CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. ; 31    “ through thickly planted groves, where the song of birds resounds perpetually in  “ the air; and now widening into a majestic stream to impart its waters to the  “numerous wheels constructed on its banks, or communicating to the plants and  “ flowers of the vicinity freshness and vigour.”   It is related of the Sult4n Ya’kib Al-mansir,‘ son of the Sultan Yusef, and  grandson of the Sultan ’Abdu-l-mimen Ibn ’Ali, that he once asked one of his  generals what the people said about Cordova. His answer was the following saying,  so common amongst the people; the North of Cordova is Shammdm, the West  Komdm, the South Moddm, she herself and Baghdad are paradise ; meaning by  Shammdm the beauty of the mountain of Roses, by Kommdm the sweetness of all the  fruits growing in her meadows, and by Moddm her river.®   Another anecdote is told of his father the Sultan Yusef: they say that he once  asked Abi Omran Miisa Ibn Sa’id Al-’ansi® to give his opinion about Cordova,  and to describe its advantages, and that Abi ’Omrdn having declined to do so  unless he heard before what the Sultan himself thought on the subject, the Prince  of the faithful then said, ‘‘ What I know about Cordova is this, that during the  “dynasty of the Beni Umeyyah, and when it was the capital of their empire, its  “limits were considerably enlarged, and its population increased most rapidly ;  “ that its streets, houses, public buildings, and palaces were almost innumerable ;  “ the revenues arising from taxes very considerable, and the productions of agri-  “culture exceedingly plentiful; that a very fine river washes its walls, that the  “ temperature is mild, and lastly, that it is placed in the heart of Andalus. This  ‘is all I know about Cordova.” ‘‘ What then remains for me to say, O Prince of  the faithful!” said Abé Omran.   The Im4m Ibnu Bashkiwél,’ quoting the words of Abi Bekr Ibn Sa’ddeh,®  gives another anecdote respecting Cordova. ‘‘ Abi Bekr,” he says, “and his  “brother travelled upon a certain occasion to Toledo, where, soon after their arrival,  “ they went to visit the Ustedh Abi Bekr Al-makhztimi, who having asked them  “whence they came, Abi Bekr answered ‘ from Cordova ;’ ‘and when?’ said  “ Al-makhzimi ; ‘just now,’ replied Abi Bekr. ‘ Then,’ said the Sheikh, ‘ come  “nearer to me, that I may smell the air of Cordova on thy garments.’ ‘I  ‘approached him,’ says Abi Bekr, ‘and he began to smell my head and to kiss  “it, and then, bidding me to take a pen and paper, he dictated to me the following  “ verses extempore :   ‘O my beloved Cordova! when shall I see thee again! when shall the  ‘time come   ‘When I may see the clouds pouring torrents of rain upon thy western  ‘ quarters, and the thunder shaking with violence the roofs of thy houses.     32 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    ‘ Thou art like an enchanted spot; thy fields are luxuriant gardens, thy  * earth of various colours resembles a block of rose-coloured amber.’ ”   But the most elegant description of Cordova that we have read any where is  undoubtedly that contained in the risdleh (epistle) of Ash-shakandi.’ As we shall  often have occasion to refer to it in the course of this work, we deem it necessary to  acquaint the reader with the motives which led to the writing of that composition.  Tbnu Sa’id tells us, on the authority of his father, who was an eye-witness, that a  dispute once arose in presence of Abi Yahya Ibn Abi Zakariyyé, Lord of Ceuta,  between Abi Yahya Ibnu-l-mo’allem, a native of Tangiers, and the Sheikh  Ash-shakandi of Cordova, on the advantages of their respective countries, Africa  and Andalus, each claiming the superiority for the land of his birth: the con-  versation growing warmer, Ash-shakandi said to his opponent, “‘ Were it not for  ‘ Andalus, Africa, thy country, would never have been known, nor would. its  “advantages, whatever they may be, have been justly appreciated, had not. our  ‘historians and poets pointed to them in their writings: were I not afraid of  “ annoying the illustrious individuals in whose company we are, I would soon  ‘ prove to thee the truth of what I advance.” ‘‘ By the Lord,” exclaimed the  Amir, who was lending an attentive ear to the arguments of the contending parties,  * go on, that is just what we want,” and his countenance was all of a sudden  illumined by the rays of vehement curiosity. Ibnu-l-mo’allem then replied—  “ Dost thou really mean to say that excellency and power reside any where else  “but amongst us? Prove it.” Ash-shakandi was on the point of undertaking  the defence of his country, when the Amir interposed and said ‘‘ the subject is  “ too important to be treated thus extempore; let each of you retire, and com-  “ pose a risdleh (epistle) in praise of his own country; you may then treat the  “ subject at large, and I shall be enabled to decide between you.” Ash-shakandi  then produced the master-piece of eloquence and learning to which frequent  allusich will be made in the course of this narrative, and from which we borrow  the following :   ‘Praise be ascribed to God who permitted that there should be in Andalus  “* people to take into their hands the praises of those who distinguished them-  “ selves ; Him who makes lasting whatever he pleases, and who has no one to  ‘‘ oppose him, and no one to find fault with him; since who will call the day  “ darkness ? who will say ugly to a handsome face? I have found a subject  ‘‘ abundant with matter, since I have been endowed with a tongue to express and  “utter. I praise Him because he made me one of his creatures, because he chose  ‘me to be one of those who acknowledge and adore him, because he caused me  “to be sprung from a noble and illustrious race, because he gave me a mind to     CHAP. II.] : DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 33    “admire and a tongue to praise the meritorious deeds, and the worthy qualities  “of my countrymen ; and I ask his blessing and favour for our Lord Mohammed,  ‘his illustrious messenger, and may God’s everlasting peace and salvation be on  “his family and companions—those of the good deeds and pure intentions !   “ But to proceed,—I have been stirred out of my tranquil state, and disturbed  “ out of my peace; I have been driven out of my pacific disposition to defence and  “contradiction by a disputer on the excellences of Andalus, who wishes to separate  “what is joined, and that we should bring to him things which neither spectators  ‘‘ ever saw nor hearers ever heard of before, or if any did, they never transmitted  “their knowledge to us, since neither those who saw, nor those who heard, were  “authorized to do so."" He pretends to make Africa superior to Andalus, which  “is as much as to say that the left hand is better than the right, and that night  “is brighter than day; and, O wonder! he wishes to oppose glass beads to  “ inestimable pearls, and to put pebbles by the side of rubies, and low lands on a  “level with inaccessible mountains; he might as well blow on a hearth where  “there is no fire, or go a hunting provided with stones instead of hawks, as  “ presume to make great what God Almighty created small, and to lead astray  “ what He decreed should be a guide.   “Where are thy wits gone? what is become of thy wisdom and penetration,  ‘‘ when the love of thy country has induced thee to extinguish both thy lights, that  “of thy eyes, and that of thy reason? As to thy expression ‘our sovereigns,’ I  ‘‘ must say that they are ours too, as can be proved by those words of a poet-—   ‘One day against us, and another for us; sometimes women, and some-  ‘ times eagles.’ ""!   “ For although it be true that the court of the West is now held in one of your  “ cities, owing to the Khalifate being in the hands of the Sulténs of the family of  ‘“Abdu-l-mimen, (may God Almighty perpetuate it in their hands!) we also  “ have had Sulténs of the Korayshite family, of whom an Eastern poet has said—   ‘I belong to a family of noble and generous people; a race whose march  ‘ is proclaimed by innumerable minarets.   ‘Khalifs among the Moslems; powerful conquerors among the infidels :  ‘ the source of every generous action, the fountain of honour and glory.’   “ And of whom a Western poet has said also—   ‘ Are we not one of the Beni Merwaén; whatever may be our fate, what-  “ ever may be the turn of fortune’s inconstant wheel ?   ‘ Whenever a birth takes place among us does not the earth assume at  ‘ his aspect the appearance of a full moon? do not the minarets quake at  ‘ the sound of his proclamation ?’ #   VoL. I. F     —_ Te  _—    34 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK 1.    “ During their reign this country produced authors and poets enough to  “ornament all the rest of the world, and whose names alone were to the pages  “* of the book of time what the collar is to the neck of the ring-dove;   ‘Whose fame found its way to all regions which the sun illumines with   ‘its rays, and travelled over all the seas and lands where the wind reaches   ‘ with its blast.’ ;   ‘“* Kings, who never ceased one moment ruling over mankind, and of whom a  poet has said—  ‘ The Khalifate in your family seems to be eternal, and the Sulténs have   ‘ succeeded each other as the pearls in a necklace united by the thread.’ *  “Until God Almighty decreed that their thread should be cut; and their  empire should vanish. They disappeared, and their history with them ; they went  away, and their very traces have been obliterated.   ‘The ornament of earth they were while they lived ; after their death, alas !   ‘ their names will only embellish books and give value to history.’ !®  “For how many noble actions did they not furnish the historian with? How  many of their memorable sayings became the property of the poet, to drive  “both him and the historian to despair with the difficulty of the subject ?   ‘ Since man always leaves behind him some memorial ; and thine will be  ‘a real treasure for the collectors.’ ”   “ One of their greatest kings was Al-mansiir Ibn Abi ’A’mir, of whom I shall  “merely mention to thee a few circumstances, for I know of no other Moslem  “who, in his conquests of the Christian territory, reached, sword in hand, to  “the very shores washed by the green sea, who did not leave in the infidel  ‘“‘ country a single Moslem captive, who surpassed Herkal (Heraclius)'* in the  “number of his armies, Iskhander (Alexander) in prudence and military talents,  “and upon whose tomb, when his doom was decreed, the following verses were  “ engraved :   ‘The traces he left behind will tell thee who he was, as if thou sawest  ‘him with thy own eyes.   ‘ By Allah, the succeeding generations will never produce his equal, nor  ‘one who knows better how to defend our frontiers.’ ?   “* More praises have been sung of this Al-manstr, and more books have been  “ dedicated to him, than is easy for me to enumerate and inform thee of, so  ‘‘much so that the fame of his name reached as far as Baghd4d, and the most  “remote corners of the globe were filled with the report of his good and bad  “* qualities.   “‘ However, when, after the breaking of the necklace and the scattering of its    “     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES 1N SPAIN. 35    “ pearls, the kings of small states divided among themselves the patrimony  “of the Beni Umeyyah, the cause of science and literature, instead of losing,   ‘gained considerably by the division, since every one of the usurpers disputed  “with each other the prize of prose and poetical composition, and overstocked  “ their markets with all departments of science ; encouraged literature, and treated  “the learned with distinction, rewarding them munificently for their labours :  “their principal boast was to have people say, the learned man such a one is  “held in great esteem by the king so and so—or the poet such a one is much  “beloved by the king so and so; so that not one is to be found among them  ‘‘who has not been distinguished by the most brilliant qualities, or who has  “not left behind him traces that the hand of time will never obliterate, and  “which will be transmitted to future generations in the writings of orators and  “poets. Such, I am told, was the case with the Sclavonian Eunuchs of Al-  “manstr, who rose in their governments after his death, such as Mujéhid,  “ Mundher, and Khayran, not to mention the Arab sovereigns of the dynasties  “of Beni Abbdd, Beni Somddeh, Beni Al-afttas, Beni Dhi-l-niin,?) Beni Hid,  “all of whom were so much praised and extolled by poets, that had the same  “praises been bestowed on night she would have become lighter even than  “day; and the poets never ceased presenting each other with the offerings of  “the sweet-scented gales playing among the flowers, and making upon their  “treasures the attacks of Al-barddh,” until their ambition grew such that one  “of their poets swore that he would not praise a king in a Kasstdeh under  “one hundred dinars, and Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbdd, having heard of it, sent  “for him and ordered him to write one, and used all sorts of persuasion to  “induce him to do it, but he obstinately refused to comply with his wishes  “unless he agreed to give him the sum he asked, it being worthy of remark  “that Al-mu’atamed was not only the most powerful sovereign of his time,  “but one who could bear the least opposition on the part of a subject.   “ One of the greatest acts of generosity that ever a monarch performed towards  “a subject appears in the following anecdote, which is a further illustration of  “what I have advanced. It is related that Abi Ghalib,* the philologist, having  “once written a very fine work, Mujdhid Al-’émiri, who was then king of  “Denia, sent him as a present one thousand dinars, a horse, and a rich suit  “of dress, requesting him at the same time to say that the work had been  “written by his orders.* This, however, Abii Ghalib refused to do, and, sending  “back the present, he gave the following answer—‘ This book I wrote merely  “for the use of the public, and in order that my name might be handed down  “to posterity ; were I to put at the head of it any other name but mine, all     36 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    “‘the honour would be his. No, I will not consent to it.’ When this answer  “* was brought to Mujahid, instead of being offended, he was much gratified and  ‘* astonished to see the high temper of his soul, and his courage and determination ;  “‘ he returned him the presents, and said—‘ he might at any rate have mentioned  “ me in his book ; this is a thing happening every day ; however, I shall not insist  “any longer.’ :   “ But it being a notorious fact that all the kings of Andalus known by the name  “of ‘ Kings of small states’ vied with each other in filling their capitals with  “learned men and poets, and encouraging by their unusual profuseness all the  “‘ branches of literature, I shall not stop to detail their actions. I shall merely  ‘“‘ remind thee of the princes of the illustrious dynasty of the Beni ’Abbdd, with  ““ whom, as God Almighty has said in his Kordn, reside fruit, palm, and pome-  “ granate, under whose reign every day was a solemn festivity, and who showed  ‘a greater passion for literature than was ever shown by the Beni Hamdan in  “« Aleppo,” and who became, together with their sons, relatives and Wizirs, the centre  “ of eloquence both in prose and in verse, labouring assiduously and unanimously  ‘in the various departments of science ; who left behind them brilliant traces, and  “ everlasting fame, and whose history abounds in generous actions and noble deeds  “ that will last through succeeding ages, and live for ever in the memory of man.  ‘* And if what I advance be not true, by Allah, do tell me the names of countrymen  “of yours who have distinguished themselves in any path whatever before the  “establishment of the present Muhadite dynasty. Dost thou mean Sakmit the  “« Hajib,* or Sdleh Al-baraghwatti? ?” or perhaps Ytsef Ibn Tashfin, who, if he  ‘* acquired any fame, owed it merely to his connexion with Ibn ’Abbdd, who, being  “ the centre of the poets of his time, and the target to which they directed their  ‘« praises and their verses, whenever they treated about him the name of Ytisef was_  “necessarily introduced ; otherwise, I ask you, would he have been known, an  “ ignorant and rude Beydawi as he was? and if not, I will relate to thee the words  “ which they attribute- to him. They say that Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abb4d asked  ‘* Yuisef once, ‘O Prince of the Moslems! dost thou know what these poets say ?’  “« «No, by my soul,’ said Yuisef, “ unless it be that they ask for bread.’ But what  “ T am going to state proves still more his ignorance: when Yusef, some time after  “ this, parted from Al-mu’atamed, and retired to his capital in Africa, the latter  “‘ wrote him an epistle, in which was the following distich :   ‘ Thou art gone, and my sides shake for want of thee, and the water of our  ‘ desert has dried up.   ‘ Thy departure has changed our days into nights, the obscurity of which  ‘ only thy presence can dissipate.’ *     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 37    “ When these verses were read to Yiisef, he exclaimed, ‘ What does he ask for ?  “ Does he not say he wants us to send him black and white slave girls ?’   “No, O master!’ replied the reader; ‘he only means to say that his night  “ becomes a day at the approach of the Prince of the Moslems; since the nights  “ spent in pleasure are called white, and those passed in affliction and sorrow black.  “ Thus he expects that with thy return day will again dawn for him.’ ‘Very well,’  “replied Yuisef, ‘ answer him that our tears are dropping for his sake, and that our  “ heads are aching for love of him.’ Such was Yiisef’s answer ; and would to God  “that Al-’abbds Ibnu-l-ahk4f® were living, in order that he might have learnt  “from him to show tenderness of love.   “ But to proceed,—since thou hast dared to dispute with us the superiority in  “the sciences, tell me, has thy country ever produced a theologian like ’Abdu-  “|-malik Ibn Habib, whose decisions are in force to this day? or like Abi-l-  “ walid Al-baji ? or like Abi Bekr Ibnu-l-’arabi ? or like Abii-l-walid Ibn Roshd,  “ the elder? or like Abi-l-walid Ibn Roshd, the younger, his son,*°—all of whom  “were the shining luminaries of faith, and the bright torches of the religious  “observances instituted by our holy prophet? Canst tho: bring forward in the  “ science of traditions men like Abi Mohammed Ibn Hazm,*! who adhered strictly  “to his principles of austerity and devotion in the midst of honours and riches,  “and while filling the high situation of Wizir, and who showed himself more  “ ambitious of literary fame than of any other, and who said, when he heard that  “his books had been consumed by fire—   ‘Do not speak to me of burnt vellum and paper; do not lament the  ‘ information contained in them, and destined for mankind.   ‘For if the books are burnt, their contents are not so; since they are  * still alive in my head.’ %?   “ Canst thou point out men of the merit of Abi ’Amru Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr, the  “author of the Al-istidhkdr (recollections) and At-tamhid, (the book of levelling) ?  “ or like Abt Bekr Ibnu-l-haddad, who is justly called the Hafedh of Andalus under  ‘the present dynasty? Has thy country ever given birth to men equal to Ibnu  ‘ Sidah,* the author of the book entitled ‘ foundations of language,’ and the  “book of nouns, of whom if it be true that he was deprived of the organ of sight,  “it is no less true that his intelligence and acuteness were unbounded?

Canst thou boast of eloquent poets like Al-fat’h  ‘« Tbn ’Obeyd-illah, of whom people used to say, that if he praised, the object of  “ his praises rose in estimation ; and on the contrary, if he reviled, he abased him  “against whom his attacks were directed, the proofs of which abound in his  ‘ Al-kaldyid,*® a work to which I refer thee? What shall I say of Ibn Abi-l-Khassdl  “ and his Tarstlah ?*° What of Abi-l-hasan Sahl Ibn Malik,*! who is one of our  “* most eminent preachers of the present day ?  “‘ Have you a poet like the Sultan Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbdd, when he said  “ respecting his father—  ‘ The general on the morning of battle awakes thousands ; after which he  ‘ himself goes to sleep ; certainly he is not to be blamed.  ‘ He has a hand which the proudest men kiss ; were it not for the dew of  ‘generosity which flows from it, we should think it to be the stone at  ‘ Mekkah.’ *  ‘“« Have you a king who wrote on the various departments of science, and all and  every one of the branches of literature, a work composed of one hundred volumes ?

We were answered,     40 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK 1.    “I left it behind, I destine it for the lips of him who shall taste the  * cup. .  ‘The drinker then tried to deny her words; and from their mutual  ‘smiles dawn was produced.’ *  “ The following is his apology for comparing the flowers to stars:— ~  ‘Dew is making the round of these gardens, and morning has exercised  ‘her power on the flying shadows of night.  ‘ The jars of scented wine are only waiting for the arrival of a cup, to put  ‘us in possession of their inviting contents.  ‘ When the stars in our globe vanish before our eyes, it is not in the West  ‘that they hide their luminous orbs ; indeed they come to deposit them in  ‘ the midst of these parterres.’ *  “ This is his excuse for using anemones in comparison with cheeks—  ‘ The gardens shine with anemones, and the light fresh gales are perfumed  ‘ with their scent.  ‘When I visited them the clouds had just been beating the flowers, and  ‘ making them as deeply tinged as the best wine.  ‘ What is their crime? said I, and I was told in answer they stole from  ‘ the cheeks of the fair their beauty.’ **  “ But it is high time that I should lay down the reins of poetry which I have held  so long in my hand, and that I should proceed to the description of the mag-  nificent cities, well populated districts, fertile fields, impregnable castles, copious  rivers, luxuriant valleys, well cultivated plains, and inaccessible mountains, in all  of which this country is as superior to thine as day is to night, as the lion is to  the ant, as the hawk to the sparrow, as the spirited horse to the broken-down  ass. I shall begin with Cordova, the court of the Khalifs of the West.  “‘ Cordova was in former times the seat of the Andalusian empire, the repository  of science, the minaret of piety and devotion; the abode of magnificence, su-  periority, and elegance. It was the dwelling-place of the first conquerors, and of  their followers, and became afterwards the court of the Sulténs of the house of  Merwan. Among its numerous advantages, that of having been the domicile of  “the famous traditionists, Yahya Ibn Yahya* and ’Abdu-l-mélik Ibn Habib,**  “both of whom held traditions from the mouth of Malik Ibn Ans, is not the least  important.  “ They say that when Ibnu Sdreh,** the poet, entered Cordova, he extemporized  “ the following verse :  ‘ ‘ God be praised, I am in Cordova, the abode of science, the throne of the  ‘ Sultans!’     CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 4l    “Cordova may be properly called the military camp of Andalus, since it was  “at one time the common meeting-place of those splendid armies which, with  “the help of God, defeated at every encounter the worshippers of the crucified.  “Tt is said of Al-manstir Ibn Abi ’A’mir, that when his authority had been  “ firmly established both in Andalus and in Africa, and his armies and treasures  “had been considerably increased, he held a general review of his troops previous  “to an incursion which he meditated into the enemy’s territory (which was carried  “into effect, and the country subdued). The number of troops which, from the  “various provinces of the empire, assembled on the outskirts of Cordova on this  “memorable occasion is generally stated at 600,000 foot, and 200,000 horse.* -  “Tt is true that since that time the glory and power of Cordova has been  “considerably reduced, but its precincts still swarm with valiant soldiers who  “are continually coming to blows with the infidel, and whose hands are never  “at rest, and many a captain might be named into whose heart fear never  “entered, and whose name is well known in the distant Christian kingdoms,  “where the memory of his deeds will live for ever.   “ T have heard also of its famous mosque, which was lighted with bronze lamps  “ made out of Christian bells ; and of the great addition made to it by Al-mansir,  “which was entirely built with the materials of demolished churches brought  “to Cordova on the heads of Christian captives.   “T have heard it said that the cities of Cordova, Az-zahraé and Az-zéhirah,  “together covered at one time a piece of ground measuring ten miles in length,  “which distance might be traversed at night by the light of lamps, placed close  “one to another.®® I have heard also of its magnificent bridge, and of the  “innumerable mills which the river puts in motion, and which are estimated at  “no less than five thousand. I have heard of its canbdéniyah®® (meadow), and  “of the great fertility with which God Almighty has endowed the earth of its  “districts, and the abundance and good quality of grain and other agricultural  “ productions which it yields every year.   “Every one who has been in Cordova must have heard of the mountains called  “ Jebalu-l-warad (the mountains of the rose), owing to the innumerable rose trees  “that grow on them. Indeed their numbers are so surprising, that although a  “roba (five-and-twenty pounds weight)® of rose leaves will at times fetch at  “Cordova four dirhems, or perhaps more, which makes it a great source of  “revenue to proprietors, yet no one prevents the people from plucking them on  “his grounds.   “The Guadalquivir at Cordova is by no means so fine a stream as it is at  “Seville, yet its waters are sweeter, and there is not so much danger of being   VOL.

The character of the Cordovans is thus described by Ibnu Sa’id. ‘ They are  ‘“‘ very fond of power, and haughty, but at the same time modest ; riches and  “science among them are hereditary, and they exhibit as much zeal in the  “‘ gaining of the former as in the acquirement of the latter. They are generous,  “‘ brave, and kind to their equals or inferiors; but they are the worst people on  “earth to obey, and the most difficult to be governed: indeed their disobedience  ‘“‘to their kings and rulers has become almost proverbial. In proof thereof I  “ shall quote here the words attributed to Sidi Abi Yahya,®! brother of the Sultan  “ Ya’kib Al-manstr. He had been governor of Cordova for some time, and when  “on his return to Africa he was asked to give his opinion on the people of  ‘“* Cordova, he is said to have answered,—‘ They are like the camel, which fails  ‘‘not to complain whether thou diminishest or increasest its load, so that there  “is no knowing what they like, to give it them, nor what they dislike, to avoid  “it. It seems as if God Almighty had created them to be continually engaged  “in war, or in the midst of civil dissensions : indeed in this respect they are worse  ‘“‘ than the people of Irak. They say that I have been removed because I treated  “them with too much severity, and yet they solicit me to return to them, but  “‘ my answer is,—the scalded cat dreads the fire.’ ”’   Cordova was the city, of all the earth, where the greatest number of books was  to be found. Abii-l-fadhl At-tifashi® relates the following anecdote :—‘ I was  “‘ once before Al-manstir Ya’ktb when a dispute arose between the faquih Abi-l-  “‘ walid Ibn Roshd and the Kaid Abi Bekr Ibn Zohr, and the former said, in  ‘* praise of Cordova, ‘ I know not what thou sayest, but what I know is that when  ‘“a learned man dies at Seville, and his heirs wish to sell his library, they  “‘ generally send it to Cordova to be disposed of, and when on the contrary a  “musician dies at Cordova, and his instruments are to be sold, the custom is  “ to send them to Seville.’ ”   But of the cultivation of science in Andalus, and especially in Cordova, as well  as the description of its great mosque, the famous bridge, the royal seat of Medinatu-  z-zahra, and so forth, it is our intention to treat in a separate chapter of this  work (if God Almighty permit us). The cities formerly belonging to the juris-  diction of Cordova were Ezija,* Bolctin,® Ronda, Cabra, Ghafek,® Al-modovar,”  Estepa, Baena, Lucena, Alcozer.®   Another of the great cities of Andalus is Gharnattah (Granada), which some  authors are of opinion ought to be written with a hamza, A’gharnittah,” a word     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 43    which means a pomegranate in the language of the Christians. If that city could  reckon no other honour but that of having been the birth-place of the Wizir  Lisanu-d-din Ibnu-l-khattib, that alone would be sufficient.   The following verses of an Andalusian Ml will show the great estimation in  which this city was held by them.   ‘“« Granada has not its like in the world; neither Cairo, Baghdad, nor  “« Damascus, can compete with it.   “« We can only give an idea of its great value by comparing it to a beautiful  “ bride, of whose dower those countries should form part.” 7°   Lisdnu-d-din, in one of his poetical compositions, where he introduces some  verses in praise of Granada, has the following : :   “« What has Cairo to boast of with her Nile, since Granada has one thousand  ‘* Niles within its Shenil.”   But in order to understand this it is necessary that the reader should know that  the numerical value of the letter shin (which is the first in the word Shenil) is  among the western Arabs one thousand, so that when we say Shenil” it is as if  we said one thousand Niles.   Shenil is not the only river that passes by Granada ; according to Ibnu Malik  Ar-ro’ayni there is another considerable stream called Daroh (Darro), and number-  less brooks ;”? several bridges for the use of the inhabitants are erected over them.   When the traveller Ibnu Battittah” arrived in Andalus on his return from his  long travels, he visited Granada, which .he describes in the following terms.  “Granada is the capital of Andalus and the husband of its cities, its environs  “are a delightful garden, covering a space of forty miles, and have not their  “equal in the world. It is intersected by the well-known river Shenil and  “ other considerable streams, and surrounded on every side by orchards, gardens,  “ groves, palaces, and vineyards. One of the most pleasant spots in its neigh-  “ bourhood is that known by the name of ’Aynu-l-adamar (the fountain of tears) ,”  “which is a spring of cold and limpid water placed in the midst of groves and  “ gardens.”   All authors agree in designating Granada by the name of Sham (that is,  Damascus), although they differ as to the way in which it acquired that name;  some pretending that the district of Elvira, of which Granada was formerly a  dependency, was called so from the Arabs of Damascus having settled in it at  the time of the conquest ; while others refer its origin to the striking similitude  which that city bears to the capital of Syria, in the numberless brooks that wind  through its meadows, and the infinite number of trees with which its territory is  covered. The author of the Minhdju-l-fakar™ (open way to reflection) concurs     44 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Boox 1.    in the latter opinion, but the former is the most common; besides, the opinions  of these authors may be easily reconciled, for Ibnu Malik Ar-ro’ayni says that the  people of Damascus were sent thither on account of the similitude the country  around Elvira bore to the place of their birth, and thus both the above-mentioned  circumstances might be pointed out as having led to the origin of its name.   Elvira was an ancient city close to the site now occupied by Granada; this is  sufficiently demonstrated by the words of Ibnu-l-khattib, Ibnu Jazzi-l-kelbi,”* Tbnu  Sa’id, and almost every author who has written on the subject, and who all  unanimously agree in saying that Elvira existed before Granada, and that when  As-sanhaji 7” founded the latter city, built its cassdéba, and surrounded it with walls,  the inhabitants of Elvira removed to Granada. Badis,”* son of As-sanhdji, went on  building and increasing his new capital until it reached the degree of splendour and  magnificence to which it was brought by the Sultans of the Merinite dynasty, in  whose time Granada became the meeting-place of the Moslems, the resort of their  troops and armies, and the strong bulwark of Andalus; for when the Franks  subdued the greater part of Andalus the inhabitants of the conquered cities and  districts all flocked to it as a place of security and protection.   At some distance from Granada to the south-east are the mountains called  Sholayr,”? whose crests are covered with snow all the year round: the snow, adds  Ar-ro’ayni, congeals so hard that it becomes as impenetrable as the rock itself. These  mountains are nevertheless inhabited by a race of stout and hardy people, and the  soil produces the most exquisite fruits, and many exotic plants of India, although  none of its drugs. According to some authors the number of towns and villages  over which Granada extended its jurisdiction was two hundred and seventy.   We shall terminate our account of Granada with the words of Ash-shakandi in  his risdleh (epistle). ‘‘ Granada,” he says, ‘‘ is the Damascus of Andalus, it is  “the delight of the eyes and the place of contemplation of the soul. It has a  “ cassdba with high walls and strong buildings, and a river which intersects its  “‘ markets, streets, and houses, supplies with water its baths and mills inside and  “* outside of the walls, and winds through the gardens and orchards of its meadow.  “‘ God has besides ornamented Granada by making it a sort of watch-tower™ in  “the midst of its extensive plain, where the melted gold of its rivers flows betwixt  “‘ the emeralds of its trees, where the sweet gales of its Nejd*! (or mountainous  “* district) cool and perfume the air. Indeed, what with its luxuriant gardens  “‘ and its majestic cypress trees, the prospect is so fine that both the heart and the  “* eyes are suspended in a kind of silent admiration, and the soul is wrapped up  ‘in the contemplation of its manifold beauties. The soil is so fertile that every  “thing which is required for man’s comfort or delight grows in it. It is not     CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 45    “ wanting in illustrious individuals of all kinds; great ulemas, distinguished poets,  “ accomplished soldiers, men fit in every respect to serve as models, are born in it ;  “ and had it received no other favour from God than that of his having made it the  “ birth-place of so many poetesses as adorned its soil, such as Nazhiin,® Al-ka-  “la’iyeh, Zeynab, daughter of Zeydd,™ Hafsah Ar-rakiiniyeh, daughter of  “ Al-hejj4j,®° and many others, this indeed would be sufficient to honour it; for all  “ these women, and many more whose names have not reached us, may for their  “wit and literary compositions be placed among the greatest poets of the time. Or  “if not, can any thing more ingenious or witty be imagined than the answer Hafsah  “gave to the Wizir and Poet Abu Ja’far, son of the Kéid Abi Merwén Ibn  “ Sa’id, when, after separating at Maumal, where they had met and passed the night,  “ he asked her to describe in verse the garden, the brooks, the cypresses, the sweet-  “ smelling gale, and all the beauties of that enchanting spot.  “God has given us a placid and beautiful night; we have seen the  ‘ cypresses of Maumal  ‘Inclining their heads before the mountain breeze, the sweet-perfumed  ‘ gales that smell of gillyflower,  ‘The dove singing her love on the branches of the dauh, and the sweet  ‘ basil inclining its boughs to the limpid brook.’   “ A few days after their separation Abii Merwdn addressed to her some verses on  “ the same subject, knowing that she would answer him; when she wrote to him  “these three verses, which are really invaluable.   ‘By thy life (thou sayest) that the garden has been rejoiced with our  ‘arrival ; I say, on the contrary, that it has only shown us hatred and ill-  ‘ will.   ‘The brook has not murmured with pleasure at our approach ; the dove  ‘ sung only to the object of her love. _   ‘ Heaven did not diminish the number of its stars, that we might observe it  ‘ more freely.’ ”   Among the districts appertaining to Granada, the following deserve more par-  ticular mention. Ist. That of Loshah (Loxa), whence the Wizir Lisdnu-d-din  draws his origin, and which extends a considerable distance through the country,  comprising many towns, villages, and castles. The capital Loxa®™ stands on a  charming spot on the banks of the river of Granada (the Shenil), and in the  midst of groves, and brooks of limpid water. The distance from Loxa to Granada  is one day’s march. 2nd. Beghah, commonly called Beighah, and the patronymic  formed from which is Beyghy. The capital of this district is the town of Beghah  (Vega), whose environs abound in wheat and fruits, and are watered by many springs     Toledo.    46 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    which irrigate and fertilize the neighbouring fields. Its territory produces also ex-  cellent saffron. 3rd. That of Wadi-ash (Guadix), which others call Wddiu-l-eshit,®  and the capital of which is the city of that name, (Guadix,) a very fine city sur-  rounded by orchards and brooks. The inhabitants are endowed with the gift of  poetry, and great love for the sciences ; the poet Abt-l-hasan Ibn Nasr,” describing  this city, gives the following verses in praise of its river.  “ O Wadiu-l-eshit! my soul falls into ecstasies whenever I think of the  “ favours the Almighty has lavished upon thee.  “ By God, thy shade at noon, when the rays of the sun are the hottest, is so  “ fresh that those who walk on thy banks cannot stop to converse together.  “ The sun itself, seeking a remedy to its own ardour, directs its course  “ through thy shadowy bed.  “ Thy current smiles through the prismatic bubbles of the waters like the  “ skin of a variegated snake.  “ The trees that hang over thy soft inclined banks are so many steps to  “« descend to thy bed, while their boughs covered with blossom, and devoured  “ by burning thirst, are perpetually drinking of thy waters.” °   But this enchanting river is not the only gift which God has lavished upon that  privileged land. The district of Guadix is besides famous for its pure and wholesome  air, its sweet waters, the delicacy of its fruits and vegetables, the richness of its  mines, and the great profusion of medicinal plants that grow in its soil.” It  extends its jurisdiction over many towns and castles; among the latter is Hisn-  Jalidnah,® a fortress which is almost as large as a city, and whence the celebrated  apples called Al-jalidnt take their name. Hisn-Jalidnah is twelve miles distant from  Guadix. Another of the peculiarities of this district is that it contains one of the  two chesnut trees that are famous all over Andalus for their size, and are described  by several authors, and among others by Ibnu Jazzi-l-kelbi, the editor of the  Travels of Ibnu Battittah,®? whose words are as follow :—‘‘ Among the wonders of  “ Andalus, one is the two chesnut trees, in the trunk of which a weaver may sit  “‘ weaving ; this is a known fact.” One of these prodigious trees is to be seen  on a mountain in the neighbourhood of Guadix, the other is in the Al-busherah™  (Alpuxarra) of Granada.   Al-munékab® (Almufecar) is a sea-port belonging also to the government of  Granada. It was there that “Abdu-r-rahman Ad-dakhel first landed when he came  from Africa to conquer Andalus.   Another of the great cities belonging to the central division was Toleytalah,  (Toledo), which at the beginning of the 6th century of the Hijra became the  capital of a kingdom founded by the Beni Dhi-l-ntin,” one of the petty dynasties     CHAP. I1.] . DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 47    which sprung out of the ruins of the Cordovan Khalifate. Kaysar (Cesar), who is  said to have founded Toledo, called it in his language Zaleytah,9* which means in  Arabic ‘‘ thou art content ;” but in the course of time the name was corrupted by  the Arabs, who changed it into Toleytalah (Toledo).   During the reign of Beni Umeyyah all the territories subject to Toledo were desig-  nated under the generic name of Al-thagheru-l-addnt, or lower frontier, to distinguish  it from Saragossa and its districts, which were called Al-thagheru-l-a’ali, or upper  frontier. Toledo was further known under the name of Medtnatu-I-molik, the city  of the kings, owing to its having been the court of seventy-two kings of various  infidel dynasties. We have said elsewhere that the Goths made it their capital ; it  is also supposed to have been for some time the residence of Suleyman, son of  Datd, (on whom be peace !) as well as of Jesus, son of Mariam, and Dhi-l-karneyn  (Alexander). It was there that Tarik, son of Zeyad, found the table of Suleyman,  which formed part of the treasures which Ishbdn, king of the Romans, and founder  of Ishbiliah, (as we have said elsewhere,) brought from the sack of Jerusalem. The  table was made out of one solid emerald, and when presented by Misa to the Khalif  Al-walid was valued at one hundred thousand gold dinars. It is generally believed  now to be at Rome, but God only knows. This inestimable jewel was not the only  treasure which T4rik found at Toledo; there were among other things one hundred  and seventy royal diadems, set with pearls, rubies, and other precious stones; a  spacious temple all filled with gold and silver vases, which temple is further said to  have been of such dimensions as to have afforded, when its riches were removed,  sufficient room for the Arab cavaliers to exercise in throwing the spear and other  military sports. This latter circumstance indeed would seem almost incredible, had °  it not been related by trustworthy people and eye-witnesses. But God is all-  knowing.   Toledo is built on the banks of the river Tajoh (Tagus), over which there once  stood a magnificent bridge, consisting of only one arch, supported by large stone  piers on both sides of the river. It measured three hundred 6é’as in length, and  eighty in width; but when the Amir Mohammed besieged and took Toledo he  ordered the bridge to be destroyed.   The Amir ’Abbds Ibn Firnds hag alluded to the taking of Toledo and the de-  struction of its bridge in the following verses :   “When morning came Toledo appeared deserted, and (like a bird) in the  “* claws of a falcon.   “Its houses uninhabited, its streets without people, the whole city as  ‘* empty and as silent as a tomb.   “ The wrath of heaven has fallen heavily upon it; even the bridge through     Malaga.    48 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    “which the inhabitants held communication with the infidels has not been  “ spared.” °   All authors who have described Toledo say that it has pleasant orchards, a  beautiful river, gardens, groves, fine fruits of every kind and description; that  its jurisdiction embraces extensive districts, good arable lands, rich meadows and  pastures, fine cities, and strong castles: one of the peculiarities of the place  being that wheat will keep under ground for a great number of years without  decaying, and is transmitted in inheritance from father to son as any other article  of property. The saffron, of which large quantities are yearly exported in caravans,  is of itself a source of wealth to the inhabitants, as well as the tincture made  with it, and which dyes of a beautiful butter colour.   The two following verses of an Andalusian poet on Toledo deserve to be tran-  scribed here.   “Toledo surpasses in beauty the most extravagant descriptions. She is  ‘indeed the city of pleasures and delight.   “God has lavished upon her all sorts of ornaments ; he has given her her  “walls for a turban, her river for a girdle, and the branches of trees for  ‘* stars,” 10   The cities depending upon Toledo are Wadi-l-hajarah (Guadalaxara), Kal’atu  Rabah'” (Calatrava), and others; but we shall not say at present any more about  Toledo, and will return to it in the course of our narrative when we relate some  of the events that took place within its walls.   The city of Malakah (Malaga) is another of the great capitals comprised in this  division ; we shall describe it in the words of Ash-shakandi, the author to whom  frequent allusion has been already made in the course of this work. ‘ Malaga,”  he says, “unites land and sea prospects, thus partaking of the advantages and  “ productions of both; its environs are so covered with vines and orchards as to  ‘“‘ make it almost impossible for the traveller to discover a piece of ground which  “is not cultivated. Its towers, which I have seen, are like the stars in the sky—  “as numerous, and shining as bright. It is intersected by a river which comes  “ to visit it in two seasons of the year—in winter and in the spring, when, rolling  ‘its precipitous waters through deep ravines and down lofty hills, it empties  “ them into the sea within the very precincts of the city. But what ranks Malaga  “ far above any other country in the world is its figs called Ar-rayt, from Rayah,'”  “ which was the ancient name of the city; I was told that they may be procured  ‘in Baghdad, where they are considered as the greatest delicacy, and as to the  ‘* quantity annually exported by sea both in Moslem and Christian vessels, it is  “so enormous that I shall not venture upon a computation, for fear of falling short     CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 49    “of the real number. During my residence in that city I once travelled along  “the sea coast from Sohayl to Tish,’ a distance of three days’ march, and I  “declare I saw nothing else on the road but fig trees, whose branches, loaded  “with fruit, almost touched the ground, so that the little urchins of the villages  “plucked them without the least trouble, besides the great numbers that were  “ scattered on the ground. Those of Tish are reckoned to be the best; it was  “of one of these figs that a Berber said, when he was asked how he liked it,  “thou askest me how I like it, and it has all melted down my throat,’ and, by  “ Allah, the Berber was right, for I never tasted better figs in my life, and  “ besides they are a blessing which God has refused to his country (Africa).   “ Another of the peculiarities of Malaga is the fabric of allowed and forbidden  “liquors, that called ‘Malaga wine’ having become proverbial. An anecdote  “is told of a Khalif, who, being on his death-bed, and on the point of breathing  “his last, was induced (as is the general custom) to ask the favours of God  “before departing from this life. They say that the Khalif, raising his hand,  ‘exclaimed, ‘O Lord! among the many delightful things which thy paradise  “ contains I ask thee for Malaga wine and Seville oil.’   “ Malaga is also famous for its manufactures of silks of all colours and patterns,  “some of which are so rich that a suit made out of them will cost many  “ thousands ; such are the brocades with beautiful drawings, and the names of  “ Khalifs, Amirs, and other wealthy people, woven into them.'*   “ All the coast of Malaga may be compared to a port, so full is it at all times  “ of vessels belonging either to the Moslems or to the Christians.”   Thus far Ash-shakandi; what follows is borrowed from other writers.   Malaga figs are famous all over the world for their sweetness and flavour ;  they are exported as far as India, China, and other remote countries, and are  universally acknowledged to be superior to any growing in other lands. The  poet Abi-l-hejaj Ytisef, son of the Sheikh Al-balawi,'® quoted by Ibnu Sa’id  and other writers, says, speaking of them—   “‘ Malaga indeed bestows life with its figs; but it also causes death by  “ them.  “ During my illness my physician forbade me to eat them ; how little does  “he care for my life!”  Another poet, the Im4m and preacher Abt ’Abdi-l-wahh4b, from Malaga, has said,  “ Hems has no figs equal to those of Malaga, but its oils deserve particular  “ mention.” 1%  Hems is here intended for Seville, a city which was called so owing to a party    of Syrians from Hems (Emesa) having settled in it soon after the conquest.  VoL. 1. H     Almeria.    50 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    The compiler of the travels of Ibnu Battittah, who quotes the preceding verses,  attributes the first to the preacher Abi Mohammed ’Abdu-l-wahhab, a native of  Malaga ; the second he gives as the composition of the Kadi Abu ’Abdillah Ibn  *Abdi-l-malik, but God only knows.   The said Ibnu Battittah, or rather the editor of his travels, describes this city  in the following terms: ‘“‘ Malaga,” he says, “is one of the principal cities of  “ Andalus; it has an excellent territory, and abounds in fruits of all sorts; I  “ saw once eight ratl'” of grapes sold in its market for one small dirhem; the  “* celebrated pomegranate named Al-murst, and another kind called Al-yacétt (the  ‘* ruby-coloured), grow on its soil; figs and almonds form a considerable staple  “ of trade, and are exported in great quantities to distant countries in the East  “and West, as also its golden pottery, which is quite wonderful. It has a  “large mosque, jdémi’, very much renowned for its sanctity, with a very fine  “open court, all planted with beautiful orange trees.”   To the west of Malaga lies an extensive district which comprises many towns  and villages, and is known by the name of Sohayl,'°* owing to a certain mountain  there, which is said to be the only spot in Andalus from whence the star Sohayl  (Canopus) is visible. To the east, on the sea shore, is the city of Belesh (Velez),  which very much resembles Malaga in the abundance and good quality of its  fruits ; farther on, on the coast, is Nerjah (Nerja),""""° which Ibnu Sa’id describes as  avery large town, almost resembling a city in size, surrounded by orchards and  gardens, and with a river so pleasant that it tempts the traveller to halt on its  banks. Another fine town depending upon Malaga is that of Al-hamah '  (Alhama), where there are springs of hot water close to the banks of the river.  But let us pass to the description of Almeria.   Al-meriyah (Almeria) is situate at the bottom of a deep valley formed by two  mountains, on one of which stands the famous castle of Kheyran, so well known  by its strength. This castle was built during the Khalifate of ’Abdu-r-rahmén  An-nassir, but was afterwards considerably improved and enlarged by Kheyrdn ""!?  the Sclavonian, a freedman of Al-mansir Ibn Abi ’A’mir, who, having usurped  the royal power, appointed his friends and adherents to the government of the  principal cities, and gave to this Kheyrdn that of Almeria, where, during the  civil war which followed the death of Al-mansiir, he declared himself independent.  The castle was named after him. On the other mountain is built one of the  suburbs, which, together with the city, is enclosed within very strong walls.  Almeria, on the whole, is a very strong place, for besides its fortifications, and  the high towers that surround it on every side, the city is as it were enclosed  within a natural barrier formed by immense primitive rocks, as sharp and naked  as if they had been passed through a sieve.     CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 51    All authors agree in saying that the inhabitants of Almeria were at one time  the wealthiest people in all Andalus, and those who carried on the most extensive  trade, owing to which the population is said to have been very considerable, and  the number of public baths and inns to have gmounted to no less than one  thousand, without counting those of its western suburb, called Rabadhu-l-haus  (the suburb of the cistern), which was also amply provided with inns, markets,  public baths, and manufactures of all kinds.   The river, which is the same as at Berja,'! also contributes no little to the  ornament of the city and its environs, for out of the one hundred and twenty  miles which make up the length of its course, the last forty, before reaching the  sea, are through orchards, gardens, and groves, where the singing birds delight  with their harmony the ears of the traveller.   We find in a certain author that one of the gates of Almeria was called  Bébu-l-’okdb (the gate of the eagle), owing toa figure of this bird which stood  on the top of it from times of old, and was beautiful to behold. This, however,  was not the only ancient relic to be found in the city, for it abounded in old  remains of buildings, and all along the coast might be seen wonderful palaces  and other stupendous structures of the ancient kings of the country.   There was in Almeria a dock-yard™* where very fine vessels were built; the  coast was safe and well frequented. But what made Almeria superior to any  other city in the world was its various manufactures of silks and other articles  of dress, such as the débdj,""* which is a sort of silken cloth surpassing in quality  and durability any thing else manufactured in other countries; the tirdz,""° that  costly stuff on which the names of Sultans, Princes, and other wealthy individuals  are inscribed, and of which no less than eight hundred looms existed at one time—  of more inferior silks, such as the holol,""” and brocades, there were one thousand  looms ; the same number were continually employed in weaving the stuffs called  iskaldtén.""® There were also one thousand for weaving robes called <Al-jorjdént  (Georgian), and another thousand for those called Isbahdnt (from Isfahan), and  a similar number for the ’Atdb/.""® The manufacture of damask for curtains and  turbans for the women, of gay and dazzling colours, employed a number of hands  equal to that of those engaged in the manufacture of the above-mentioned articles.  Almeria was also famous for the fabrication of all sorts of vases and utensils,  whether of iron, copper, or glass.   All fruits growing on its soil partake of a sweetness and flavour rarely to be met  with in other countries ; to describe them all would be a hopeless task ; the reader  who wishes to acquire more information on the subject may consult an excellent  history of this city composed by Abi Ja’far Ibn Khatimah,'® with this title,     52 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book 1.    ‘“* Advantages of Almeria over other cities in Andalus.” It is a very thick  volume, of which we possess a copy, but it is in Africa with the rest of our  library ; we trust in God, who has the power of collecting what is scattered  and joining what is separated,‘ that he will restore us to the possession of our  books and chattels.   But we cannot leave the description of this city without copying the words  of Ash-shakandi, for although by following this method we may now and then  be guilty of repetition, yet it is evident that our information is considerably  increased by comparing the accounts of different writers. ‘‘ Almeria,” says  Ash-shakandi, ‘is an opulent and magnificent city, whose fame has spread far  “and wide. God has endowed its inhabitants with various gifts, such as a  “temperate climate, and abundance of fruits; they are handsome, well made,  ‘“‘ good natured, very hospitable, very much attached to their friends, and are  ‘“‘ above all things very refined in their manners, and very elegant in their dress.  ‘“Tts coast is the finest in all the Mediterranean, as well as the safest and the  ‘* most frequented.   “In Almeria are found agates of different shades, which the nobles and other  ‘* wealthy people of Morocco put in their bardrid,’"" as also the polished marbles  “called Al-malhikt (Royal). Its river, called Wddi Bejénah,' is one of the  ‘* pleasantest streams in the world, both its banks being planted with orchards,  “‘ gardens, and trees, so that it looks like a half-smiling mouth in the midst  “‘ of two rosy cheeks covered with whiskers ; and certainly the poet was right  “who, describing the territory washed by this river, said,   ‘It is a land where if thou walk the stones are pearls, the dust is musk,  ‘ and the gardens paradises.’ '**   ‘“ Almeria was at one time under the sway of the famous Kd4id Ibn Maymin,'™™  ‘* who made himself so conspicuous by the great naval victories he gained over the  ‘* Christians, and who, scouring the seas in all directions, stopped the navigation  ‘‘ of the infidels, ruined their trade, made an incursion into Romaniah (Italy),  ‘‘ attacked its ports, and filled the hearts of the inhabitants with terror and  ‘consternation. Such was the terror of his name that, quoting the words of  ‘a poet,   ‘If the enemy was awake, he dreaded him,—if asleep, his sharp-edged sword  ‘ played upon his throat.’ 15   “ Almeria was the greatest mart in Andalus; Christians of all nations came  “to its port to buy and sell, and they had factories'* established in it. From  “thence the Christian merchants who came to its port travelled to other parts  “and markets (in the interior of the country), where they loaded their vessels     CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 53    “with such goods as they wanted, owing to which, and to its being a very  “ opulent and large city, filled with passengers and merchants, the produce of  “the tithe imposed upon the goods and, paid by the Christian merchants  “amounted to very considerable sums, and exceeded that collected in any  “other sea-port.   “Costly silken robes of the brightest colours are manufactured in Almeria.”  Thus far Ash-shakandi.   Some of the districts surrounding Almeria deserve mention. One of them is  that of Berjah (Berja), where lead is to be found in great abundance. Its capital,  Berja, is situate on a very pretty river called Wédi-’Adhra'” (the river of Adra),  whose banks are covered with trees and flowers. A poet has said very happily,   “When one comes to Berja on the road to Almeria there is no remedy  “ but to stop there and desist from the journey,   “ For indeed its houses and gardens are so many paradises, while the roads  ‘* leading to them are so many hells.” 18   Hisn-Shinsh’™ is a fine town distant one day’s march from Almeria. Its territory  abounds in mulberry trees, by means of which a prodigious quantity of silk-worms  are reared. The river of Tabernash (Tabernas) passes close to this town.   “ Jayyén” ° (Jaen), says Ash-shakandi in his risdleh, ‘is the citadel of Andalus ; Jaen.  “ for no city can be compared with it for abundance of grain, number of valiant  “soldiers, nor for the strength and solidity of its fortifications. Indeed during  “the last civil war and its disastrous campaigns the infidels had more than one  “ opportunity of showing their inability to compete with the Moslems, since as  “many times as they appeared before the walls of that city they were severely  “ repulsed, obliged to raise the siege, and to fly further than the Pleiades,'*' and  “to make themselves as scarce in the surrounding districts as the eggs of the  “ pelican are among the rocks.'*?   “Jaen is not destitute of ulemas and poets. It is the birth-place of many  “ illustrious individuals in all professions, and the sciences are cultivated in it  “ with as great an ardour and enthusiasm as in any part of Andalus. It is generally  “ known by the name of Jayyenu-l-hartr '* (Jaen of the silk), owing to the extensive  “cultivation of mulberry trees for the rearing of silk worms within Jaen and in  “ the environs. ;   “Tt may also be said in praise of Jaen that it extends its jurisdiction over  “ districts like that of Ubedha (Ubeda), where the vines are in such abundance  “that their fruit cannot be sold on account of its excessive plenty, and like  “that of Bayésah (Baeza), which is famous for its saffron which is exported in  “ great quantities by land and water.     54 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    “The first-mentioned district (Ubeda) offers another very striking peculiarity,  ‘« viz., that its inhabitants are all very fond of music and dancing ; so that thou  “wilt find among them dancing girls who are famous for their beauty and  “admirable shape, and who dance with great elegance and taste. They are  “also very expert in playing with swords, and cups, in drawing horoscopes,  “ untying knots, and finding out hidden things.” '™",book_1,chapter_2

IsHBiLtaH (Seville) was one of the finest cities of Andalus. We have stated Seville.  elsewhere (following the words of Ibn An-naththém) that it was founded by  Ishbin, king of the Romans. However, the building of this city is by others  attributed to another king of the Romans whose name was Julius, and who was  the first to take the title or appellation of Kaysar (Cxsar). Which of the two was  its real founder we are unable to determine. They say that when-Cesar came to  Andalus, and saw the spot which is now occupied by Seville, he was very much  struck with the beauty, extent, and apparent fertility of the country all around  him; that he was also very much pleased with the luxuriance and fine vegetation  of the mountainous district (now) called Asharaf (Axarafe), and therefore deter-  mined upon building a city in that spot. Having chosen a convenient situation  on the banks of the Wddi-l-’adhem (Guadalquivir),! he began the building of his  city, which he surrounded with strong stone walls, and in the certre of which he  erected two citadels of wonderful structure, which he named Al-akhdwin (the two  ‘sisters).2 Kaysar, moreover, fixed his residence in his new city, which became thus _  the capital of his kingdom, and was known ever after by the name of Juliah-  Romtyah,> which its founder gave to it, being a compound of his own name  (Julius) and that of his native country (Romah).   Seville, as we have already remarked, became also the capital of Andalus during  the Gothic domination, for the kings of this race used to divide their court between  four principal cities, viz. Seville, Cordova, Carmona, and Toledo; and to reside in  one of these four cities, according to the different seasons of the year.   One of the authors who has described Seville expresses himself in the following  terms :—‘ Seville is built on the banks of the Guadalquivir, also known by the  “name of Wddi Kortubah (the river of Cordova). A very handsome bridge of  “ boats, fastened together by means of iron chains, serves as a communication for     oor    56 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book 1.    ** the people living on the two banks of the river.‘ The city itself is fine and well  ‘* built ; the squares are large, and the market-places commodious and abundantly  “* provided with every necessary,.as also with articles of trade of the most expensive  ‘* kind, which afford great gain to the merchants. The people of Seville are said  ‘* to be wealthy ; their principal traffic consists in their oils, which they ship to  ‘« distant parts of the East and West. The olive tree grows very luxuriantly in all  ‘* the districts dependent on the city, but above all, in that called Axarafe,® which  “ is an extensive tract of land measuring about forty miles in length, and nearly  “as much in width, formed of gentle hills of a reddish earth, and where there are  “* forests of olive and fig trees planted so thickly as to afford the passengers who  “ travel through them a complete shelter in the hottest summer day. The Axarafe  “ contains besides a very large population scattered in farm houses, or living in  “towns and villages, which have also their market-places, their baths,—fine  ‘* buildings, and other conveniences and comforts only to be met with in cities  ‘* of the first order.”   The author of the Minhdju-l-fakar (open way to reflection) says that Seville  was one of the handsomest cities in the world, and its inhabitants famous for their  indolent habits, and their love of pleasure, which in them was almost proverbial.  They led a most luxurious and dissipated life, which, the author observes, “‘ was  “ chiefly owing to the delightful river that flows through their territory, and which  ‘* has not its equal in the world. It is navigable for large vessels, and is always  ‘ filled with pleasure-boats kept by the inhabitants, and by fishing or trading  “ vessels : in the opinion of some it surpasses in beauty the Euphrates, the Tigris,  “ and the Nile. Its banks are covered with fruit trees, forming a sort of canopy  “ over the river, so that one may sail in it sheltered from the rays of the sun, and  “listening to the charming melody of the singing birds. The journey along its  _ banks is equally pleasant, and one may travel the distance of ten parasangs-  “« (thirty miles) through clusters of buildings and farm houses, high towers and  “ strong castles, forming a continued city. The tide is perceptible in the river of  “ Seville at a distance of seventy-two miles from the sea. It also abounds in fish,  “ of which the daily consumption is almost incredible. The amount of taxes paid  “« by the city of Seville only, during the Khalifate of Al-hakem Ibn Hisham, is stated  “ at one hundred and thirty-five thousand dinars.”   Seville and its territory was also known by the name of Hems (Emesa), as we  have said elsewhere ; for when the lands of Andalus were divided among the Arab  settlers it fell to the lot of the people of Emesa in Syria, whose banner imme-  diately follows that of the people of Damascus in the processions at Medina.   Various are the works of art and splendid buildings described by the authors     CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 57    who have written about Seville ; but the most amazing of all is unquestionably the  tower attached to the great mosque, which was built during the reign of Ya’kib  Al-manstir. As a piece of architecture it is unparalleled in the world. Ibnu Sa’id  mentions also several spots in the vicinity of Seville to which the inhabitants used  to resort for the sake of recreation and indulgence ; one was Tarayanah (Triana) ,°  one of the suburbs attached to the city, the other Kabtdi,’ an island on the  Guadalquivir.   Another of the peculiarities of Seville is that figs and oil will keep for a consider-  able length of time without being spoilt ; the sugar cane grows in its territory ; and  the worm called kermes,® which dyes of a colour superior to the lac of India, is  also found in great abundance on the oak trees. But, indeed, were we to enumerate  all the excellences of its soil, we should protract this work to an interminable  length. However, as Seville is one of the cities described by Ash-shakandi in his  risdleh, and this with his usual accuracy and eloquence, we shall here quote his  words :—‘‘ Seville,” says that learned and most accomplished writer, ‘‘is to be  “ praised for many things: mildness of temperature, purity of air, fine buildings,  “ good streets, picturesque environs, and abundance of provisions and commodities  “of all sorts. This latter requisite indeed gave rise to that saying, so common  “among the people of Andalus—‘ If thou seekest for birds’ milk, by Allah thou  “shalt find it in Seville.’ Nor can I pass in silence its beautiful river, the  “Guadalquivir, in which the ebb is felt at a distance of seventy-two miles, and  “which the poet Ibnu Saffar describes in that very ingenious distich—   ‘ The breeze falls playfully on the river, and, lifting up the skirts of its robe,  ‘ agitates the surface of its waters; the stream, resisting the outrage, hastens  ‘ down to revenge it.  ‘The ring-dove laughs on its banks from the excess of his love, and the  ‘ whole scene is covered with the veil of tranquillity and peace.’ ®  _ “But this is neither the time nor the place to explain the phenomenon of   ‘the tide. Both banks of the Guadalquivir are covered with pleasure-gardens,  “orchards, vines, and yew trees,’® in such profusion that I doubt whether there is  “any river in the world to compete with it in this respect; and let this not be  “ taken as an exaggeration, for I once questioned a very intelligent man, who had  “ travelled through Egypt, about the Nile, and he told me that that famous river  “had neither the verdure, nor the orchards, gardens and pleasure-grounds, which  “the Guadalquivir has on its banks. I also asked a traveller who had resided in  “ Baghdad, and he gave me a similar answer about the Tigris: in fact, the  ‘‘ Guadalquivir can only be compared to a paradise, for not only are the districts  “‘ watered by it the most.delightful regions that can be imagined, but the inhabitants   VOL. 1.

The compiler of the travels of Ibnu Battiéttah, who quotes the preceding verses,  attributes the first to the preacher Abi Mohammed ’Abdu-l-wahhab, a native of  Malaga ; the second he gives as the composition of the Kadi Abi ’Abdillah Ibn  *Abdi-l-malik, but God only knows.   The said Ibnu Battittah, or rather the editor of his travels, describes this city  in the following terms: ‘“ Malaga,” he says, ‘is one of the principal cities of  “ Andalus; it has an excellent territory, and abounds in fruits of all sorts; I  “saw once eight ratl'’ of grapes sold in its market for one small dirhem; the  “celebrated pomegranate named Al-murst, and another kind called Al-yacétt (the  “‘ ruby-coloured), grow on its soil; figs and almonds form a considerable staple  “of trade, and are exported in great quantities to distant countries in the East  “and West, as also its golden pottery, which is quite wonderful. It has a  “large mosque, jdémi’, very much renowned for its sanctity, with a very fine  * open court, all planted with beautiful orange trees.”   To the west of Malaga lies an extensive district which comprises many towns  and villages, and is known by the name of Sohayl,'® owing to a certain mountain  there, which is said to be the only spot in Andalus from whence the star Sohayl  (Canopus) is visible. To the east, on the sea shore, is the city of Belesh'® (Velez),  which very much resembles Malaga in the abundance and good quality of its  fruits ; farther on, on the coast, is Nerjah (Nerja),''!° which Ibnu Sa’id describes as  avery large town, almost resembling a city in size, surrounded by orchards and  gardens, and with a river so pleasant that it tempts the traveller to halt on its  banks. Another fine town depending upon Malaga is that of Al-hamah '  (Alhama), where there are springs of hot water close to the banks of the river.  But let us pass to the description of Almeria.   Al-meriyah (Almeria) is situate at the bottom of a deep valley formed by two  mountains, on one of which stands the famous castle of Kheyran, so well known  by its strength. This castle was built during the Khalifate of ’Abdu-r-rahman  An-nassir, but was afterwards considerably improved and enlarged by Kheyran '!?  the Sclavonian, a freedman of Al-mansir Ibn Abi ’A’mir, who, having usurped  the royal power, appointed his friends and adherents to the government of the  principal cities, and gave to this Kheyrdn that of Almeria, where, during the  civil war which followed the death of Al-manstr, he declared himself independent.  The castle was named after him. On the other mountain is built one of the  suburbs, which, together with the city, is enclosed within very strong walls.  Almeria, on the whole, is a very strong place, for besides its fortifications, and  the high towers that surround it on every side, the city is as it were enclosed  within a natural barrier formed by immense primitive rocks, as sharp and naked  as if they had been passed through a sieve.     cHaP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 51    All authors agree in saying that the inhabitants of Almeria were at one time  the wealthiest people in all Andalus, and those who carried on the most extensive  trade, owing to which the population is said to have been very considerable, and  the number of public baths and inns to have amounted to no less than one  thousand, without counting those of its western suburb, called Rabadhu-l-haus  (the suburb of the cistern), which was also amply provided with inns, markets,  public baths, and manufactures of all kinds.   The river, which is the same as at Berja,° also contributes no little to the  ornament of the city and its environs, for out of the one hundred and twenty  miles which make up the length of its course, the last forty, before reaching the  sea, are through orchards, gardens, and groves, where the singing birds delight  with their harmony the ears of the traveller.   We find in a certain author that one of the gates of Almeria was called  Badbu-l-’okdb (the gate of the eagle), owing to a figure of this bird which stood  on the top of it from times of old, and was beautiful to behold. This, however,  was not the only ancient relic to be found in the city, for it abounded in old  remains of buildings, and all along the coast might be seen wonderful palaces  and other stupendous structures of the ancient kings of the country.   There was in Almeria a dock-yard * where very fine vessels were built; the  coast was safe and well frequented. But what made Almeria superior to any  other city in the world was its various manufactures of silks and other articles  of dress, such as the dtbdj,""° which is a sort of silken cloth surpassing in quality  and durability any thing else manufactured in other countries; the firdz,""° that  costly stuff on which the names of Sultans, Princes, and other wealthy individuals  are inscribed, and of which no less than eight hundred looms existed at one time—  of more inferior silks, such as the holol,""” and brocades, there were one thousand  looms ; the same number were continually employed in weaving the stuffs called  iskaldtén.""® There were also one thousand for weaving robes called Al-jorjént  (Georgian), and another thousand for those called Isbahdnt (from Isfahan), and  a similar number for the ’Atdbf.""® The manufacture of damask for curtains and  turbans for the women, of gay and dazzling colours, employed a number of hands  equal to that of those engaged in the manufacture of the above-mentioned articles.  Almeria was also famous for the fabrication of all sorts of vases and utensils,  whether of iron, copper, or glass.   All fruits growing on its soil partake of a sweetness and flavour rarely to be met  with in other countries ; to describe them all would be a hopeless task ; the reader  who wishes to acquire more information on the subject may consult an excellent  history of this city compdsed by Abi Ja’far Ibn Khatimah,'® with this title,     58 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK 1.    “‘ on both its banks are the merriest people on earth, always singing, playing on  ‘‘ various instruments, and drinking wine, which among them is not considered  “« forbidden, as long as it is used with moderation, and does not cause intoxication,  “‘ which leads to perversity and vice. It is true that there have been at times in  ‘* Seville governors and Sultans, who, being firmly attached to religion, and the  “ strict observance of its ordinances, have done every thing in their power to check  “ the evil; but all their attempts have been vain, and they have never succeeded  ‘< in eradicating it entirely. The Sevillians are generally believed to be the most  “ frivolous of men, and the most witty and jocose ; they are very much inclined to  “« jesting, but sometimes their satirical propensity leads them to break out into the  ‘* grossest injuries and calumny ; this is indeed so inveterate an evil among them  ‘« that it has become like a gnawing worm, and has contaminated all the classes of  ‘‘ society ; and the, corruption has gone.so far that whoever follows not their  ‘‘ example, and indulges not in all these excesses,—whoever is not a calumniator  ‘* and a slanderer of his neighbours, is sure to be hated by them most cordially.  “ Respecting the Asharaf (Axarafe) of Seville much has been said by various  “‘ authors ; it is thus described by a poet, in a composition which he addressed to  “ the Sultan Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbéd,—  ‘ Seville is a young bride ; her husband is ’Abbdd ;  © Her diadem Asharaf; her necklace the river.’ ""  “‘ This district has already been described by me: I shall only add here that it  ‘* surpasses in beauty and fertility every other spot on the face of the earth; that  “ the oil of its olives is exported as far as Alexandria; that its hamlets and villages  “‘are much superior to those of other countries in the extent and commodi-  ‘‘ ousness, and the fine designs and ornament, of their houses, which, from the  “‘ continual white-washing, look like so many stars in a sky of olive trees. An  ‘* Andalusian, who had visited both Cairo and Baghdad, being once asked whether  “ he thought either of those cities superior to Seville, is said to have answered,  “« after expatiating long in praise of Seville and its Axarafe,—  ‘ Axarafe is a forest without wild beasts; its river a Nile without  ‘ crocodiles.’ '? .  ““T have heard also of the mountains called Jebelu-r-rahmah, (the mountain of  ‘* mercy),'? which are in the neighbourhood of Seville, and where fig trees of the  “* species called Al-mitt{'* (the Gothic), and Ash-sha’rt'® (the hairy), grow in great  “‘ abundance ; and I have been told by people who have travelled into almost every  ‘« quarter of the globe that these two kinds of figs grew nowhere in such perfection  “as at Seville.  ‘* Musical instruments of all sorts may at any time be procured in Seville, where     CHAP.

Thou wilt find there the khiydl,'®  “ the kerbehh, the ’owd, the rétteh, the rabdb, the kdnin, the minis, the kannerah,  “the ghindr, the salémt, the shakarah, the nirah, (these two last instruments  “ being both flutes, with this difference, that the former has a very deep tone, and  “ the latter a very delicate and melodious one,) and the dk (clarionet). Many of  “these instruments may, it is true, be found in other cities of Andalus, as also  “ players on them, but nowhere in such numbers as in Seville, where they are manu-  “ factured in great quantities, and then exported to Africa, no instruments being  “ fabricated there but those peculiar to the country, such as the dif,” the akwdl,  “the bard, the Abi Karin, the dabdabah of the blacks, and the hamékt of the  “ Berbers.   “As to their means of conveyance by land and water,'® their cookery, their  “fresh and dried fruits, their vegetables and other productions of their soil, it  “would take us too long to describe them.   “ T have also heard of the magnificence and good design of its buildings; most  “of which, not to say all, are abundantly provided with running waters, and  “‘ spacious courts planted with fruit trees, such as the orange, the lemon, the lime,  “and the citron tree. The sciences and the arts are cultivated with more or less  “ardour, with more or less success; the number of their authors is indeed too  “ considerable to be stated, and their writings too well known to need description ;  “ the list of its poets '® is so long, that were they to divide among themselves the  “whole of the opposite land (Africa) they would hardly be contained in it; they  “ have been at all times amply remunerated by Sulténs and wealthy citizens.”   Such are the words of Ash-shakandi in his risdleh. Let us now pass to the  description of cities dependent upon Seville. .   Al-hijari says that Sherish (Xerez) is the daughter of Seville, and its river  the son of the Guadalquivir; he adds that Xerez is a very fine city, with a large  population, and extensive markets, and that it very much resembles the city of  Sa’d in Upper Egypt. Its inhabitants he describes as people of great imagination  and talent, very elegant in their dress, and in the interior of their houses; re-  markable for their good manners and courtesy, and so sensitive and tender-  hearted that it is not. an uncommon thing among them to see people of either  sex die from the excess of their love.   Xerez is famous for the confection of the mojabénah,” which are a sort of  cake kneaded together with cheese, and fried in good oil. Their celebrity may  be ascribed to the superior quality of the cheese with which they are made. It  is a common saying among the Andalusians, ‘‘ Whoever has resided in Xerez, and  “ not tasted its mojabénah, ought to consider himself altogether unhappy.”    Xerez.     Gibraltar.    Tarifa.    Beja.    60 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    Talikah (Italica), a city now in ruins, was formerly the capital of a flourishing  district. There was once found a marble statue of a woman with a boy,”' so admirably  executed that both looked as if they were alive; such perfection human eyes never  beheld, nor was it ever heard of in history; and if we are to believe the accounts  of those who saw it in one of the public baths of the city, where it was afterwards  placed, some Sevillians had been so much struck with its beauty as to become  deeply enamoured of it. A poet, a native of this city, who has alluded to it in a  beautiful distich, says that in his time it was in the baths called Ash-shatarah.”   Another of the districts which acknowledge the jurisdiction of Seville is that of  Jebal-Tarik (Gibraltar), which stands as a lasting testimonial of the conquest of  Andalus by the Moslems. This mountain was called after Tarik, freedman of  Misa Ibn Nosseyr, who was the first Moslem who landed on it; it is also called  Jebalu-l-fatah (the mountain of the entrance or victory). The sea surrounds the  mountain of Gibraltar on almost every side, so as to make it look like a watch-  tower erected in the midst of the sea, and facing Algesiras. A certain Granadian  poet alludes to Gibraltar in the following distich :   ‘‘The mountain of Tarik is like a beacon spreading its rays over the seas,  “ and rising far above the neighbouring mountains :   ‘One would say that its face almost reaches the sky, and that its eyes are  “‘ watching the stars in the celestial tracts.” *   And this is by no means exaggerated, for when travellers approach it, coming  from Ceuta, they see it at a distance shining as bright as a lamp. ‘TI sailed once,”  says Abt-l-hasin Ibn Misa Ibn Sa’id, “ with my father from Ceuta to Gibraltar,  “and had an opportunity of verifying the truth of this assertion. When we came  “‘ near the coast my father told me to look in the direction of Gibraltar ; I did so,  “ and saw the whole mountain shining as if it were on fire.”   Jezirah-Tarif (the island of Tarif) is another dependency of Seville. Tarif, after  whom the island was named, was a Berber and a freedman of Misa. They say that  by his master’s command he invaded Andalus before Térik, and landed at Tarifa  with four hundred men. This happened in the year ninety-one of the Hijra  (a. D. 709-10), but of this more will be said, if God be pleased, in the course of  this work. Tarifa is not, properly speaking, an island, but was so called on account  of one that stands before it in the sea ; the same might be said of Jeziratu-l-khadhra  (Algesiras).   Beja™ is the capital of an extensive district, which, during the dynasty of the  Beni ’Abbad, formed part of the kingdom of Seville. It was famous for its tan-yards  and manufactures of cotton goods. The territory abounds in silver mines, and it has  besides the glory of being the birth-place of Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbad.     CHAP.

Umeyyah it reached such a degree of splendour as to be only second to Cordova,  the capital, in size, population, and magnificence of buildings. But owing to the  seditious character of its inhabitants, who were continually revolting either against  their governors or against the Sultans of Cordova, the city was destroyed during  the reign of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, and never afterwards restored. Merida is built on the  banks of a considerable river called Wadi-anah (Guadiana).*   On the same river, about thirty miles to the west, is the city of Bathalids ° Badajoz.

He transmitted  his empire to his posterity, of which three princes reigned, until the last, ""Omar  Al-mutawakel, was slain by Seyrin Ibn Abi Bekr, general of the Almoravides.   The following distich in praise of Badajoz is the composition of the Wizir and  poet Abi ""Omar Al-fallds.?°   “O Badajoz!

Its district, and that of Shantareyn (Santaren),  which are contiguous, abound in gold mines. They produce also a kind of honey,  very much resembling sugar in appearance, and which is never found in a liquid  state ; the inhabitants keep it in cotton bags. Another of the peculiarities of this  coast is the amber which is thrown up by the sea in great quantity, and which in  its kind is superior to that of the Indian seas, and is only equalled by the  shajart.®   Between Lisbon and Talavera, a city placed on the banks of the river that comes Bridge of the  from Toledo (the Tajoh), stands the famous bridge known by the name of Al-kant- sword.  aratu-s-seyf (the bridge of the sword), the construction of which is attributed to  the first Caesar, and is one of the wonders of the world.

On the top of this arch is a tower rising to a     Silves.    62 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book I.    height of forty cubits above the bridge, which, as well as the tower, is built of  large blocks of granite, each measuring eight or ten cubits in length. At the  summit of the tower, and in one of the stones of which it is built, is a brazen  sword fixed into it, with this wonderful peculiarity, that whoever seizes the handle  and draws it may extract about three spans of it, but no human efforts have yet  succeeded in drawing it out further; when the handle is let go the sword goes with  great violence into the stone, as if it went into a scabbard.*!   Close to the district of Lisbon is that of Oksonébah (Ossonoba), the capital of  which bears the same name, and is a very fine city, to which many towns, villages,  and castles are subject. Further down towards the coast is the city of Shib  (Silves), which was once the capital of an independent state formed by the Wizir  Abt Bekr Mohammed Ibn ’Omar, known by the surname of Dhi-l-wizdrateyn.  But when the Beni Lamtumnah subdued the greatest part of Andalus, this and  other western districts were joined by them to the government of Seville. Silves  is seven days’ march from Cordova; it has the honour of being the birth-place of  Dhi-l-wizdrateyn Ibn ’Omar,*? (may God show him mercy !) and of the Kaid Abi  Merwén ’Abdu-l-mélik Ibn Bedrén, by others called Ibn Badrin, a literary man of  great repute, and who is known as the author, among other works, ofa commentary  on that famous ode of Ibn ’Abdin* which begins thus :   “« Succeeding generations shall be afflicted at the recollection of his  “ virtues.” 3*   This commentary is too well known to néed a fuller description ; we have found  it in most of the great cities in the East, where it is held in great estimation.  The author, Ibn Badrin, was himself a very good poet.   Silves is likewise the birth-place of the famous grammarian Abii Mohammed  *Abdullah, son of As-sid Al-Bathlidsi.*   The whole of western Andalus was at one time under the dominion of the Beni  *Abbéd, kings of Seville, the most powerful Sultans of the time. The great  revenues they derived from their states enabled them to keep considerable  armies, and to surround their court with learned men and poets, who, encouraged  by their liberality, cultivated the sciences with the greatest ardour, and sung  their praises in eloquent and elaborate compositions. Liblah (Niebla), Jebdrah  (Ebora), Shant-Mariah (Santa Maria), Mertilah (Mertola), Jeztrah Shaltish (the  island of Saltes), Shintarah (Cintra), are among the cities of the West which  once acknowledged the supremacy of the Beni ’Abbaid. The last named city  (Cintra) presents, according to Ibn Alisa’, a very curious phenomenon, which  is, that wheat and barley are generally ripe forty days after having been sown ;  the country produces also a very large kind of melons,** measuring three spans     CHAP.

Speaking of this fruit, Abi ’Abdillah Al-yakdri,7 an author  on whose writings great reliance is placed, states that he was once sitting with  Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbad, king of Seville, when a peasant from Cintra entered  the room, and presented the Sultan with four of those melons, which not only  measured five spans in circumference each, but weighed so much that the man  could hardly carry them in a basket on his head. The Sult4én was very much  surprised to see so fine a fruit, and began to question the peasant, who answered  that those melons did not always grow to so great a size, but that they could  easily be obtained of those dimensions by cutting off all the branches of the plants  but ten, and then supporting the stem by means of props of wood.",book_1,chapter_3
"    Saragossa.    64 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book I.    CHAPTER IV.    Eastern district—Saragossa—Valencia—Murcia—Cartagena—Albarracin.    Tue eastern district of Andalus contains also many cities of the first order, such  as Saragossa, Valencia, Murcia, Cartagena, Santa Maria, and others.   Sarakostah (Saragossa) was, according to some authors, built by the first Cesar,  the emperor of Rome, in whose reign begins the era called safar,' which preceded  the nativity of Christ, and by which the Christians compute their years. Sarakostah  means, in the language of the Christians, ‘‘the palace of the Lord,” ? and was so  called on account of the said Cesar having fixed his residence in it while he stayed  in Andalus ; others attribute its foundation to Alexander, but God only knows.   It is generally acknowledged that there was no city in Andalus to which more  cities, towns, hamlets, and castles, were subject, than Saragossa, nor which abounded  more in fruits of all kinds, nor which was more plentifully supplied with provisions  of all sorts, nor which counted at one time a larger number of inhabitants. It. was  surrounded by orchards and gardens for a space of eight miles; and the Andalusian  authors often compared it to the cities of Chaldza for the number of its trees, and  the abundance of its waters. It is by them described as a city of great importance,  extending its jurisdiction over several large provinces and wealthy districts, some of  which, teeming with an industrious and active population, covered a space of forty  miles.   Among the productions of its territory is counted salt, which, according to some  historians, is to be found near the capital, white, pure, and transparent, and such as  cannot be procured any where else in Andalus. We find also recorded by more  than one historian and collector of traditional stories that a very curious pheno-  menon has been observed in the neighbourhood of Saragossa. No scorpion, they  say, will enter the territory of Saragossa of its own accord, and if taken there by  any one, the moment it touches the ground it will lose all its power of action, and  remain motionless: the same phenomenon has been remarked in the East with     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 65    respect to other reptiles, and has been explained by philosophers and naturalists  as the effect of the talismanic influence which some countries are known to  exercise over certain animals ; at least such is the solution given to this curious  circumstance by all the Eastern authors who have treated the subject. One  thing, however, is certain, namely, that all Western writers agree in saying that  no scorpion or snake*® ever entered the territory of Saragossa without dying  immediately, and that the experiment was repeatedly tried of bringing them  from distant lands, but no sooner were they within the precincts of the city than  they died suddenly on the spot. To this wonderful quality of the soil about  Saragossa we may add another very striking peculiarity, which is recorded by  almost every author who has. undertaken the description of that city. They say  that no provision or article of food, however long it may be kept, will ever  mildew or be spoiled ; wheat will kéep for a hundred years, and grapes suspended  to the ceiling for six ; figs, peaches, cherries, apples, and plums, are preserved  in a dry state for several years, while it is not uncommon to see beans and  garbanzos which have been gathered thirty years; wood never rots, and no  article of dress, whether of wool, silk, or cotton, is ever moth-eaten.   We have likewise read somewhere that when Miisa Ibn Nosseyr came to  Saragossa, and tasted the waters of the Jelk,‘ he found them so sweet and  good that he swore he had never drunk any thing better since he came into’  Andalus ; and that having inquired about the name of the well, when he heard  it called Jelk he threw a glance all around him and compared the country to the  ghautah (meadow) of Damascus.   The city of Saragossa became, towards the middle of the fifth century, the  seat of a powerful and extensive empire, founded by Suleyman Ibn Hiid,° one  of the generals who, during the calamitous times of the civil war, proclaimed  the sovereignty of the extinct house of Umeyyah, and declared themselves inde-  pendent in their governments. Several authors who have written the history of  the Beni Hid dynasty describe most minutely a famous palace called Déru-s-sorrir  (the abode of pleasures), built by Al-muktadir Ibn Htid, one of the Sultans of that  family, and in which was a golden hall of exquisite design and admirable work-  manship, decorated in the most magnificent manner. This palace is alluded to  in some verses by the Wizir Dhi-l-wizd4rateyn Ibn ’Abdi-shelb.   Saragossa has been called Ummu-l-kér (the mother of the provinces), and its  territory Thagheru-l-a’ali, the meaning of which has already been explained.

K     Valencia.    66 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book I.    Molina, Birtanieh, Barweskah (Bribiesca), and others, are among the districts  over which Saragossa extends its jurisdiction.   Among the great kingdoms of the east of Andalus is that of Valencia, which,  after the overthrow of the Beni Umeyyah dynasty, made one of the independent  states into which the inheritance of the Khalifs was broken up. Valencia, the  capital, is one of the finest cities in Andalus ; it is described by Ibnu Sa’id as a  place of great recreation and entertainment, owing to the purity of the air, the  fertility of the land, which makes its environs look as green and luxuriant as a  garden, and the amiable and cordial disposition of its inhabitants, who are always  disposed to pleasure and mirth. The same author (Ibnu Sa’id) says that Valencia  was known under the name of Medinatu-t-tarab (the city of mirth), and that he  once heard his father say that Merwan Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz,’? who had  been king of that city and had retired to Morocco after the loss of his kingdom,  used to say, in praise of Valencia,   “I may compare Valencia to a beautiful maiden dressed in a green robe  “* of delicate texture ; if I approach her she conceals under her green garments  ‘“‘ her white and transparent bosom.” .   The said author (Ibnu Sa’id) says that the territory of Valencia produces very  fine saffron, as also certain pears called Al-arrozah,® not larger than a grape,  but very delicate in taste, and which have so delightful a smell that one may  tell directly by going into a house if there be any of that fruit in it. He asserts  also, on the authority of various writers, that the atmosphere at Valencia is clearer  and more transparent than in any other part of Andalus, and adds that adjoining  to the city are several pleasant gardens and public walks for the use of the  inhabitants, such as the Risséfah,® and the Munyatu-bn Abt ’A’mir..° The Rissdfah,  especially, is described by him as a most delightful and charming spot, full of trees,  orchards, and brooks, and from which a commanding view of the country may be  obtained ; no other spot in Andalus had that name but the gardens of Cordova  and those of Valencia.   Abi-l-hasan Ibn Harik has said, in his reply to Ibn ’Iy4sh,   “Valencia is a spot of great beauty, and its fame has filled both East  “and West. .   “If they tell thee that when water is wanting it is afflicted by famine and  “* plague, and the whole city becomes the abode of misery and desolation,—  ' “ Tell them that, notwithstanding all that, Valencia is a paradise whose  “ lovely spots are at all times free from war and famine.”   Valencia is also in the number of the cities described by Ash-shakandi in his  risdleh ; we shall therefore transcribe his words. ‘‘ Valencia,” he says, ‘‘ is known     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 67    “ amongst us by the name of Al-mitydbu-l-andalus (the scent-bottle of Andalus),  “ owing to its numerous orchards and flower-gardens, with the sweet exhalations  “of which the air is always embalmed. The garden called Ar-risséfeh is one of  ‘the pleasantest spots in the world. Near it is a large lake of limpid and  “transparent water,’ which, they say, reflects the rays of the sun in such a  “manner that the light in Valencia is increased by it: this, indeed, is a fact to  “which all authors who have written upon Valencia bear ample testimony.  “ Among the manufactures of this city that of the nes{j, which is exported to  “all parts of the West, deserves particular mention.   “Valencia is not wanting in sons who have distinguished themselves in arms,  ‘“‘and in the sciences. It has given birth to distinguished theologians, eloquent  “‘ poets, and, above all, to many valiant warriors, who have withstood with courage  “the attacks of the infidels, and won the crown of martyrdom in bloody fields of  “ battle.   “The Valencians are very honest,—they are people of very good morals, and  “strongly attached to religion, which they observe most scrupulously in all its  “ practices ; they are also constant in their affections, social, and very hospitable  “to strangers.”   The illustrious poet Abi Ja’far Ibn Mos’adeh Al-gharnétti has said, in allusion  to Valencia,   “ Valencia is a terrestrial paradise; such it is considered to be by its  “ inhabitants ; there is only one thing to make it disagreeable, and that is  “the musquitoes.”   Another poet has said, alluding to these insects,   “There is one thing in Valencia which annoys me most, and puts me out  “ of humour—   “Which is, that the fleas are continually dancing to the music of the  “ musquitoes.””   We shall close our account of Valencia with the following verses of an excellent  poet, Ibnu-z-zakkék,""? a native of that city :   “‘ When I think of Valencia every other city vanishes from before my eyes.   “The more I think of it, the more I am struck with its incomparable  “* beauties.   “God has given it for a dress its green meadow sprinkled with flowers, of  “ which the sea and the river form the skirts.”   Among the districts surrounding Valencia is that of Shdtibeh'* (Xatiba), a city  whose beauty and fertility have become proverbial, and where writing-paper of  excellent quality is manufactured. This city is the birth-place of Abu-l-késim Ibn     Murcia.    68 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    Feyroh Ibn Khalf Ibn Ahmed Ar-ro’ayni, the author of the Hirzu-l-amdnt (refuge  of the wishes), of the ’Aktleh (handsome pearl), and other works. Another is that  of Jeztrah Shukar™* (Alcira), which is also very extensive and well populated ;  then comes Deniah'® (Denia), on the sea shore, an ancient city ; Almansaf  (Almansa), the birth-place of the austere and devout faquih Abi ’Abdillah Al-  manséfi, who is buried at Ceuta, where his tomb is visited, and held in great  veneration; Bartdnah (Partana), a town famous for the battle fought in its  neighbourhood between the Christians and Moslems, in which the former were  completely defeated. To this battle the poet Abii Ishék Ibn Ma’éli At-tarsisi '¢  alludes, in those verses which say—   ‘“‘ The Christians were clad in bright armour, but ye were arrayed in silken   “‘ robes of various colours.   “‘ Partana is the spot where your valour and their cowardice became   “once more manifest.”   Mateytah (Matet) is another town dependent on Valencia; a great many theo-  logians and learned authors derive their patronymic from it. Ondah (Cala-onda),  which has a mountain in the neighbourhood with iron mines. It is important not  to confound this city (Ondah) with another whose name is spelt with a ra, Ronda,  and which belongs to the central division, and has also a castle called Ondah.""”   The other great province of this eastern division is that of Tudmir, which was  also called Misr (Egypt), on account of the similitude it bears to that country, for,  like Egypt, the territory round Tudmir is at certain fixed periods of the year  inundated and fertilized by a river called Wddiu-l-abiadh'® (Guadalaviar). As  soon as the waters withdraw the land is sown, and the crops are gathered, as in  Egypt, before the next inundation. The capital of this province was formerly the  city of Tudmir, but in progress of time it was joined to Murcia, and both cities then  formed one under the latter name. We find that Murcia was also called Al-bostén  (the garden), owing to the great fertility and fine vegetation of the valley in which  it stands. A considerable river (the Segura), after watering the greatest part of  its territory, empties itself into the sea south of Murcia.   “ Murcia,” says Ash-shakandi, “is the court of eastern Andalus ; its inhabitants  “ are famous for strength of body, as also for their obstinacy and disobedience to  ‘their rulers. Its river is the brother of the Guadalquivir, since they both spring  ‘* from the same source in the mountains of Shekvirah (Segura).'!® Its banks toa  ‘* great extent are covered with orchards and gardens, and planted with fine trees ;  “and the pendant boughs, the music of the water-wheels on its banks, the  “charming melody of the singing birds, the sweet perfumes exhaled by the  * flowers, are indeed beauties which baffle all description. Murcia is perhaps the     cHaP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 69    “city of Andalus where fruits of all sorts, and odoriferous plants and shrubs,  “ abound most, owing to which, as well as to its mild temperature, to the beautiful  “ landscape around the city, and to the great fertility of the earth, the inhabitants  “are perhaps of all the world the people who enjoy most comforts and luxuries,  “and who show most disposition to gaiety. We can only do justice to Murcia  “ by comparing it to a house from which a young and handsome bride should set  “out (to her husband’s dwelling), arrayed in all her ornaments and finery.   ‘“* As in Malaga and Almeria, there are in Murcia several manufactures of silken  “cloth called al-washiu-thalathdt.” It is likewise famous for the fabric of the  “carpets called tantilf, which are exported to all countries of the East and West ;  “as also a sort of mats, of the brightest colours,’ with which the Murcians cover  “the walls of their houses. Besides the above-mentioned objects, there are in  “Murcia fabrics of several articles of trade which it would take us too long to  ‘“ enumerate.   “Murcia has given birth to many learned theologians, eminent poets, and  “valiant captains.”   The preceding are the words of Ash-shakandi in his risdleh (epistle). We shall   “now borrow from other writers the account of the districts, cities, and towns,  comprised within the limits of the province of Tudmir.   The first in importance after Murcia is Kartajénah (Cartagena), which all authors Cartagena.  agree in representing as a very ancient city, surrounded by a fertile territory, where  whatever is sown grows with such rapidity that it is not uncommon to see in some  of its districts the corn springing up after one day’s rain. It is also said that  Cartagena was in ancient times one of the wonders of the world, owing to its  magnificent buildings, and other stupendous structures, showing the wealth and  power of its former inhabitants. Ruins of these great buildings are to be seen  to this day, with columns, arches, inscriptions, idols, and figures of men and  beasts, in such profusion that they dazzle the eyes of the beholders: the most  important of these gigantic constructions is, following the words of a geographer,  the Ad-dawdmis,” which consists of twenty-four piles of free-stone, all equal in  size, and over which are twenty-four arches, measuring one hundred and thirty  paces from pier to pier, and sixty in width, the elevation being upwards of two  hundred cubits: over these arches, and at a giddy height, the water flows through  perforated stones from one pillar to another, the whole of the structure bemg  raised by dint of mathematical science, and finished with the greatest skill.”   Such is the description which a famous geographer has given of Cartagena, but  in our opinion he is mistaken, for the Cartagena here alluded to is in Africa, and  not in Andalus. The author of the Minhdju-l-fakar (open way to reflection) has     Albarracin.    70 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    not fallen into so gross an error ; om the contrary, whenever he happens to mention  in his work either of these two cities he always makes a proper distinction, and  calls'the African one al-’attkah (the ancient), and that which belongs to the  district of Murcia, and which we are at present describing, al-khalfd (the modern).   The city of Lércah (Lorca) is another dependency of Murcia; its territory  abounds in mines of lapis-lazuli. Hisn Milah (Mula), Aurtweélah (Orihuela), Lecant  (Alicante), are among the districts which acknowledged Murcia as their capital  during the fifth and sixth centuries of the Hijra, when it formed a powerful state,  sometimes attached to the kingdom of Valencia, and sometimes to that of Almeria,  until it was finally subdued by the Almoravides.*   We have still to mention an extensive territory lying half-way between Valencia  and Saragossa, and which, after the overthrow of the Beni Umeyyah, was erected by  its governor into an independent state, and continued to be such during all the  time of the civil war. It is the district of As-sahlah,* which others call Al-kartdém,  and the capital of which is Shant-Mariah (Santa Maria). Abi Merwén ’Abdu-l-  mélik Ibn Razin, known by the appellative of Jesému-d-daulat (the body of the  state), and Al-hdjib (prime minister), was the founder of it.     CHAP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 71    CHAPTER V.    Islands surrounding or dependent on Andalus—Cadiz—Canary Islands—Fortunate Islands—  Algesiras—Tarifa—Mallorea—Menorca—Iviza.    ANpDaLus is surrounded by islands, or countries called islands by the Arabs.  Among the latter is Jeztratu-Kddis (Cadiz), which belongs to the jurisdiction of  Seville, although Ibnu Sa’id places it in the territory of Sherish (Xerez) ; but, well  considered, it comes to the same thing, for Xerez and its district belong also to  Seville.   Cadiz is filled with- the remains of buildings, temples, aqueducts, and other Cadiz.  wonderful constructions of the ancient kings of Andalus. ‘‘ The most remarkable of  “ these monuments,” says Ibnu Ghalib, in his work entitled ‘ Contentment of the  ‘ soul in the contemplation of ancient remains found in Andalus,’ ‘is. undoubtedly the  “tower and idol at Cadiz, which has not its equal in the world, if we except  “another of the same shape and description which stands on a high promontory in  “ Galicia. It is notorious that so long as the idol on the tower at Cadiz stood,  ‘it prevented the winds from blowing across the straits into the Ocean, so that no  “ large vessels could sail from the Mediterranean into the Ocean, or vice versa ;  “but, on the contrary, when it was pulled down in the first years of the reign of  “the Beni ’Abd-al-mimen, the spell was broken, and vessels of all descriptions  ‘began to furrow the sea with impunity.”   This idol, in the opinion of some writers, held some keys in his right hand, but  the contrary has been proved by the author of the Ja’raflyah, as we shall have  further occasion to show. It is also stated, that according to an ancient tradition  the belief prevailed all over Andalus that underneath the idol an immense treasure  lay concealed from times of old: that the tradition existed no doubt can be enter-  tained, since various writers, who saw this idol, agree in saying that when ’Ali  Tbn Misa,’ nephew of the K4id Abi ’Abdillah, who held the charge of Admiral  of the Sea, revolted, and declared himself independent at Cadiz, he caused the",book_1,chapter_4

These islands may be seen a great distance off at sea, and in clear summer days,  when the atmosphere is quite pure and free from vapours or mist, they are dis-  covered rising far above the horizon. According to the geographer Ibnu-l-wardi,  there is in each of these islands a tower, one hundred cubits high, on the top of  which is an idol of brass, pointing with his hand towards the sea, as if he meant  “there is no passage beyond those islands.” Ibnu-l-wardi? adds that he could  not remember the name of the king who erected those towers; but we find that  Idrisi attributes them to Iskhander dhi-l-karneyn.   In this sea (Ocean), and further towards the north, are the islands called  As-sa’dddt* (the fortunate), in which there are many cities and towns, and from  whence the Majts, a nation of Christians, came. The nearest of these islands is  that of Birtanniyah (Britain), which is placed in the midst of the Ocean, and.  has no mountains or rivers. The inhabitants drink rain-water, and cultivate  the land.   The island of Shaltis,® which is at the lower end of Andalus, is populated, and  has a city which bears its name. The seas in the neighbourhood abound in fish,  which is salted and sent to Seville, where the consumption is very great.   Shaltis belongs to the district of Liblah (Niebla), which is contiguous to that of  Ondba.   These are the islands of the Ocean; those of the Mediterranean are Algesiras,  Tarifa, Mallorca, Menorca, and Iviza, which we shall presently describe.   Algesiras and Tarifa we have already described elsewhere : they are not, properly  speaking, islands, but are so called owing to their topographical situation. The  same may be said of Shaltis. Further into the sea towards the east are three  islands, called Mayérkah (Mallorca), Menérkah (Menorca), and Yébisah (Iviza) ;  the two former are at a distance of fifty miles one from the other. That of Mallorca,  which is the largest in size, may be traversed in one day from one end to another.  The capital is a fine and populous city, and has a canal in which water flows all the  year round ; but we shall describe this island in the words of Ash-shakandi.   “ The island of Mallorca,” says that elegant writer, ‘‘ is one of the most fertile  ‘“and best cultivated countries that God ever made ; it is also the most abundant  “in provisions of all kinds; for were it by some accident to be deprived of an  ‘‘ intercourse with other lands, it would still produce every article necessary for  “the maintenance or the comfort of its inhabitants. It possesses, besides, many     CHAP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 73    ‘‘ other advantages, which we pass in silence for the sake of brevity ; suffice it  ‘* to say that it has a magnificent capital, well populated towns, extensive districts,  “* good lands, and more water than it requires for the irrigation of its fields; and,  “ lastly, that it has given birth to many eminent ulemas, and illustrious warriors  “‘who have valiantly defended their country from the attacks of the Christians  “‘ who surround it on every side—   “* Like a pack of hungry wolves, intent upon their prey.”   We think it proper to add here some verses which the poet Ibnu-l-labbénah °  wrote in honour of the capital of this island.   “It is the city to which the ring-dove has lent the prismatic colours of his  ** collar, and the peacock his beautiful variegated plumage.”   The preceding verses are part of a kasstdah which the said Ibnu-l-labbénah  addressed to the king who reigned at that time over the island, and who, it  appears, did much good to the country, and built more than Iskhander himself  ever did.   Next to Mallorca, towards the east, is the island of Menorca, which the author Menorca.  of the Ja’raftyah describes as very small but very fertile, and abounding in grain  and fruits of all sorts, especially grapes. He also says that meat in this island  is particularly good and well-flavoured, and better than any where else; so much  so, that beef, when roasted, will melt as if it were grease, and turn into oil. Sheep  abound in the island, but they are of a very small breed.   West of Menorca and Mallorca is another island smaller than either, called tviza.  Yébisah? (Iviza). It may be about thirty parasangs in length, and nearly as much  in breadth ; it supplies great part of Africa proper® with wood and salt. The island  is well peopled, and the inhabitants are very industrious ; the land produces all  sorts of grain and fruits, but sheep do not thrive; they have goats, and feed  upon their flesh. Raisins, almonds, and figs are among the articles which the  inhabitants grow and export to the neighbouring island of Mallorca. Olive  trees do not grow in the island; indeed the inhabitants do not know them,  and they receive their oil from Andalus.   Besides the above-mentioned islands, there are in this sea (the Mediterranean)  many more, such as Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Malta, but, as they never belonged  to Andalus, although in the possession of Moslems, we shall abstain from the  description of them for brevity’s sake; for, indeed, were we to relate all the  remarkable things contained in these islands, the wonders of the two seas that  surround Andalus, we should neglect the principal object of this our work ;  in fact, we might as well consecrate a whole volume to the description of  them.   VoL. I. L     74 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    We shall now say a few words about those cities in Andalus which fell early  into the hands of the Christians, and where Islamism was rooted up by the  obdurate infidels who attribute partners to God. Alas! at the moment we  write this the whole of that delightful and highly-gifted country, where the  unfurled banners of Islamism waved triumphantly for so many ages, where the  sweeping tide of Isl4m incessantly rolled its mighty waves over the shores of  polytheism, and where the unity of the Almighty God and the mission of his  holy Prophet were unanimously and daily proclaimed from the tops of countless  minarets, is now in the possession of the cruel enemies of God; the heroes who  so long withstood the attacks of both Franks and Goths are no more ; the virtuous  ulemas who instructed the people in the duties of religion, and who opposed their  breasts to the impetuous torrents of idolatry, are either scattered over the world,  or enjoying in paradise the recompense due to their virtues; the temples once  consecrated to Divinity are now places of scandal and impiety, and not one  Moslem remains in the vast precincts of Andalus to praise the true God, and to  bless by his presence the spots that were once the abode of piety and science.  God is great! God is great! There is no strength or power but in God!    The country of | Barshelénah® (Barcelona), on the eastern coast of Andalus, is situate in a sort    the Infidels.    of valley formed by the Jebalu-I-bort (the Pyrenees), which separate Andalus  from the country of the Franks. Barcelona is close to the sea, and has a harbour,  but it is a bad one, and vessels cannot go into it except with a pilot. Barcelona  is a middle-sized city, being neither large nor small; it was several times taken  by the Christians, and retaken from them, during the first centuries after the  conquest, till at last it was ultimately subdued by the infidels’® in the year 383  of the Hijra (a. p. 993-4), and has since remained in their hands, constituting  one of their greatest kingdoms.   On the opposite side of Andalus, that is to the west, inclining a little towards  the north, is the country of Jalikiyah (Galicia), the capital of which is the city  of Shant-Yakoh (Santiago). The author of the geographical work entitled Kitdbu-  l’ajdyib""' (the book of wonders) says that there was in this city a very large  church, held in great veneration by the Christians, who considered and worshipped  it as the Moslems do Jerusalem. ‘‘ Christians,” he adds, ‘“‘ from Constantinople,  ‘“« France, and other infidel countries, came every year to this city, and visited  “its church, not because of its being the seat of a patriarch, but because they  “pretend that the church was built by one of the Apostles of Jesus, son of  ‘“* Mariam, whose name was Yakoh, others say Yacéb; the church which he built  “* was called Shant-Yakoh, that is, the church of Yago, for Shant, in the language  “of the Christians, means a temple, a place of worship, and is an equivalent     cHapP. v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 75    “of our word mesjid (mosque). Every Christian who comes to this city, and  “ visits its temple, is held in great respect by his countrymen, his authority  “increases, and he calls himself hAdj{ (pilgrim). The church is built in, the  “midst of an island formed by an arm of the sea, and has only one door.”   The same author says that there is in Galicia a lake called Al-buheyratu-  l-meytat ? (the dead lake), and that that name has its origin in a very wonderful  peculiarity of its waters, for no human being, animal, fish, or bird, will live in  it, or, if taken thither from other parts of the country, it will die immediately,  with the exception of the peacock, which is known to live, and feed, and lay  its eggs in it. Tbnu Jezz4r, who speaks also of this lake, places it in the heart  of Galicia.   Some other cities, like Liyén (Leon), Samérah (Zamora), Banbilénah (Pamplona), Barbarous ma:  are occasionally mentioned by geographers, but we shall not stop to describe them ; on Andalus.  let whoever wishes to acquire more information on the subject consult the works  of Abi ’Obeyd Al-bekri, Idrisi, and other writers, who have not only described  the cities that were in the hands of the Christians, but given the most ample  and circumstantial account of the manners, customs, and habits of their inhabitants.  However, as it is important that the reader should know who were the nations  of infidels with whom the Andalusian Moslems had to contend for such a length  of time, we shall here transcribe the words of the Kétib Ibrdhim Ibnu-l-kdsim  Al-karawi, known by the surname of Ar-raktk-beladi-l-andalus'* (the slave of  Andalus), who, treating of the barbarous nations who live on the borders of  Andalus, expresses himself in the following terms. ‘‘ The Andalusians are a  “brave and warlike people, and great need have they of these qualities, for they  “are in continual war with the infidel nations that surround them on every side.  “To the west and north they have a nation called Jalalcah (Galicians), whose  “ territories extend from the shores of the Western Ocean all along the Pyrenees.  “The Galicians are brave, strong, handsome, and well made; in general the  ‘ slaves of this nation are very much prized, and one will scarcely meet in Andalus  “with a handsome, well made, and active slave who is not from this country.. As  “no mountains or natural barriers of any kind separate this country from the  “Moslem territories, the people of both nations are in a state of continual war  “on the frontiers.   “To the east the Moslems have another powerful enemy to contend with ; that  ‘is the Franks, a people still more formidable than the Galicians, on account  “of the deadly wars in which they are continually engaged among themselves,  “their great numbers, the extent and fertility of their territory, and their great  “resources. The country of the Franks is well peopled, and full of cities and     76 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book I.    “ towns; it is generally designated by geographers under the name of Ardhu-l-  “« kebtrah (the great land). The Franks are stronger and braver than the Galicians,  “‘ —they are likewise more numerous, and can send larger armies into the field.  “They make war on a certain nation bordering on their territory, and from  ‘‘ whom they dissent in manners and religion; these are the Sclavonians, whose  “land the Franks invade, and, making captives of them, bring them to be sold  “to Andalus, where they are to be found in great numbers. The Franks are in  “the habit of making eunuchs of them, and taking them to castles and other  “places of safety in their territory, or to points of the Moslem frontier, where  ‘the Andalusian merchants come to buy them, to sell them afterwards in other  “‘ countries. However, some of the Moslems who live in those parts (near to  “ the frontiers) have already learnt that art from the Franks, and now exercise it  “‘ quite as well as they do.” *    ee ay a eres     CHAP.

Ruins and ancient remains—The Aqueduct of Tarragona—that of Cadiz—Roman causeways—lIdol of  Cadiz—The pit of Cabra—Iron pot of Kal’atu-Auraéd—Ancient tradition concerning the conquest  of Andalus—Extraordinary olive tree—Water-clocks of Toledo.    Asv ’Osgyp AL-BEKRI says that Andalus contains ruins of buildings erected by  the Greeks, and talismans constructed by their philosophers: he includes in the  number of these the tower of Cadiz, that of Galicia, the amphitheatre of Murbiter  (Murviedro), the water-works of Tarragona, the bridge of the sword, and many other  stupendous buildings scattered all over the country ; and which that author asserts  are for the most part attributed to one of the ancient kings of Andalus, whose name  was Herkiles (Hercules).   Some of these structures are fully described by Ibnu Ghdlib in the historical work Aqueduct at  entitled ‘‘ Contentment of the soul in the contemplation of the ancient remains found Temagone  in Andalus,” as for instance the aqueduct of Tarragona, which he says conveyed the  water from the sea to the city by a gentle level, and in the most admirable order,  and served to put in motion all the mill-stones in the town, the whole being one of  the most solid, magnificent, and best contrived buildings that ever were erected.’   Another wonderful aqueduct was that of Cadiz, which conveyed fresh water Aqueduct  from a spring in the district of the idols? to the island of Cadiz, crossing an arm  of the Ocean. It consisted of a long line of arches, and the way it was done  was this: whenever they came to high ground, or to a mountain, they cut a passage  through it ; when the ground was lower they built a bridge over arches ; if they met  with a porous soil they laid on a bed of gravel for the passage of the water; when  the building reached the sea shore the water was made to pass under ground, and  in this way it reached Cadiz. That part of the aqueduct nearest to the sea Ibnu  Sa’id tells us was still visible at the time he wrote.®   Another of the vestiges of the ancient kings of Andalus were the causeways Roman cause-  which traversed it in all its length. ‘‘ We read,” says Ibnu Ghilib, “in some of the",book_1,chapter_5
"    Idol of Cadiz.    78 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    ‘* histories of Rome that when Julius, known by the surname of Heshar (Cesar),  “ began to reign, he ordered the earth to be measured, and roads to be constructed.  “* According to his injunctions causeways were made from Rome to the east, west,  “north, and south of the earth, until they reached half the circumference of the  “‘ globe. One of these causeways led to Andalus, and ended to the east of Cordova,  “near the gate of ’Abdi-l-jabbar. Another, beginning at the gate of Al-kantarah  ‘* (the bridge), south of that city, led to Shakandah, Estijah (Ezija), Karménah  “ (Carmona), Seville, and the sea.* Both these roads were by the orders of  “« Julius provided with mile-stones, on which his own name, that of the city to  “which the road led, and the distance from Rome, were engraved ; they say also  ‘that he ordered that the mile-stones should be furnished with a roof in some  ‘‘ parts of the road, intending them as halting-places for travellers, who might  “shelter themselves from the rays of the sun in summer, and from cold and  “rain in winter ; but that these buildings being in the course of time converted  “into places of corruption and iniquity, and into so many haunts frequented by  “robbers and vagabonds, owing to their situation in the midst of uninhabited  “ districts, and far from towns, the work was discontinued, and the mile-stones  “left in the state in which they are at present.”   The author of the Kitdbu-l-ja’raftyah® has furnished us with details concerning  the tower of Cadiz. We shall quote his own words. ‘In this city,” he says,  (meaning Cadiz) ‘‘ there formerly stood a square tower, upwards of one hundred  “ cubits high, and built of large blocks of stone, admirably placed one on the  “top of another, and fastened together by hooks of brass. On the top of the  “ tower was a square pedestal of white marble, measuring four spans,® and on it a  “ statue representing a human being, so admirably executed in form, proportions,  “and face, that it looked more like a living man than an inanimate block. His  “ face was turned towards the Western Sea; he had his back to the north;?  “‘ the left arm extended, and the fingers closed, with the exception of the fore-  “* finger, which he held in a horizontal position, pointing towards the mouth of  “‘ that sea which issues out of the Ocean, and lies between Tangiers and Tarifa,  “being known by the name of Bahru-z-zokék (the Straits of Gibraltar). His  “right arm was close to the body, as if holding his garments tightly, and in  “the right hand he bore a stick, with which he pointed towards the sea. Some  “authors pretend that what he held were keys, but it is a mis-statement; I  “‘ saw the idol often, and could never discover any thing else but the above-  “ mentioned stick, which he held in his right hand in a vertical position, and  “‘ somewhat raised from the ground; besides, I am assured by the testimony of  “ trustworthy people, who were present or assisted at the pulling down of this     CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 79    “idol, that it was a short stick, of about twelve spans in length, having at the  “end some teeth like a curry-comb. Who was the builder of this tower, with  “the idol on the top, does not sufficiently appear. Mes’idi, in his ‘ Golden  “ Meadows,’ ® attributes its construction to Al-jabbdr,® the same who built the  “ seven idols in the country of Zinj, which are one in sight of the other: but  “the most probable opinion seems to be that it was built by some of the ancient  “ kings of Andalus to serve as a guide to navigators, from the fact of the idol  “ having his left arm extended towards the Bahru-z-zok4k (straits), and pointing  “to the mouth, as if he was showing the way. There were not wanting people  “who thought this idol to be made of pure gold; for whenever the rising or  “ setting sun fell on the statue it sent forth rays of light, and shone in the  “ brightest hues, like the collar of a ring-dove, blue being the colour which  “ prevailed. Thus placed on the top of the tower the idol was like a signal for  “ the Moslem navigators to go in and out of the Ocean, and whoever wanted to  “ sail from any port in the Mediterranean to places in Al-maghreb, such as Lisbon,  ‘and others, had only to approach the tower, and then put up the sails, and  “make for the port whither they wished to go, whether Salé, Anfa, or any  “ other in the western coast of Africa. When in after times this idol was pulled  “ down, it ceased of course to be a signal for navigators: its demolition happened  “thus. In the year 540 (a. D. 1145-6), at the beginning of the second civil war,  “ *Ali Tbn Isa Ibn Maymin,""” who was Admiral of the Fleet, revolted at Cadiz, and  “ declared himself independent. Having heard the inhabitants say that the idol on  “« the top of the tower was made of pure gold, his cupidity was raised, and he gave  “ orders for its immediate removal. The statue was accordingly brought down by  “ dint of great exertions, and when on the ground was found to be made of brass,  “ covered only with a thin coat of gold, which, when removed, produced twelve  “ thousand gold dinars. It is a general opinion among Andalusian and African  “Moslems that this idol exercised a sort of spell over the sea, but that the charm  “ ceased the moment it was thrown down. They account for it in the following  “‘manner. There used once to be in the Ocean some large vessels which the  “ Andalusians call kardkir,'? provided with a square sail in front, and another  “behind; they were manned by a nation called Majis, people of great strength,  “ determination, arfd much practice in navigation, and who at their landing on the  “coasts destroyed every thing with fire and sword, and committed unheard-of  “ ravages and cruelties, so that at their appearance the inhabitants fled with their  “ valuables to the mountains, and the whole coast was depopulated. The in-  ‘“ vasions of these barbarians were periodical—they took place every six or seven  “ years ; the number of their vessels was never less than forty, it sometimes     Pit of Cabra.    Iron pot at    Kal'atu-Aurad.    80 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    “ amounted to a hundred ; ""3 they devoured any one they found on the sea. The  ‘tower that I have described was known to them, and, following the direction  ‘‘ pointed at by the idol, they were enabled to make at all times for the mouth  ‘‘ of the straits, and enter the Mediterranean, ravage the coasts of Andalus, and  “the islands close to it, sometimes carrying their depredations as far as the coasts  ‘‘ of Syria. But when the idol was destroyed by the command of ’Ali Ibn Maymin,  ‘“‘as I have already stated, no more was heard of these people, nor were their  ‘* kardkir (vessels) seen in these seas, with the exception of two that were wrecked  “ on the coast, one at Mersu-l-Majis (the port of the Majis),* and the other close  “ to the promontory of Al-aghar.”   Among the wonders of Andalus one is the pit of Kabrah (Cabra), which, in the  opinion of Ar-razi, who mentions it, is one of the gates of the winds. It is to be  seen at some distance from Cabra,'* and whatever efforts have been made to find  the bottom of it have proved ineffectual.   Tbnu Sa’id also mentions a mountain in the neighbourhood of Kal’atu-Aurdd '®  where, says he, is a rock with a wide gap, and within it an iron pot hanging by a  chain. Whoever goes to the spot will see it, his hands will touch it, but all his  attempts to take it out will be fruitless; for no sooner will his hands come in  contact with it than the pot will sink in the cavity of the rock and disappear ;  however, if the person desists from his undertaking it will return to its former  position. This is related by Ibnu Sa’id on the authority of Ibnu Bashkiwal, who,  among some ancient traditions, and other wonderful stories, concerning Andalus,  mentions the following :   “ Tt has been related to us on the authority of a traditionist, who had it from  “ Seyf, that ‘Othman Ibn ’Affan said ‘ that the conquest of Constantiniyeh (Con-  “ stantinople) would be made from Andalus.’ Perhaps he meant Rome instead of  “ Constantinople, but God is all-knowing.”   Such are the words of Ibnu Bashkiwél; but this point requires elucidation.  The tradition to which that illustrious writer alludes stands thus. ’Othmén is said  to have sent an army from Cairwdn to the conquest of Andalus, and to have written  to the generals who were to command the expedition : ‘‘ Know ye how the conquest  “ of Constantinople shall be made, passing first through Andalus; so, if ye quickly  ““ subdue those regions whither ye are bound, ye shall participate of the favours  “of God.” Such is the tradition; but let the responsibility of it lie on its  preservers, for as to us, we wish to be considered entirely pure and free from  it; for although it be true that it has been adopted and repeated by Ibnu Bash-  kiwél, by Ibnu Sa’id, and other respectable writers, yet we cannot give credit to  it, for it is not only improbable, but entirely devoid of foundation. For at what     CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 81    time, we ask, did ’Othm4n send troops from Africa to conquer Andalus; when  it is evident, nay, it rests on incontrovertible proofs, that the Arabs never invaded  Andalus until the times of Al-walid, and that Cairwdn, the city from whence  the expedition is said to have departed, was not built until twelve '? years after  the death of that Khalif? However, let not these objections of ours be taken  as uttered in contempt of the authors of the tradition: we merely state them  as a proof of our ardent wish to warn our readers against error, and to assist  them in the investigation of truth.   Another of the wonders of Andalus we would pass over were it not that all  the historians of that country mention it. It is an olive tree, which is said to  blossom and produce fruit on a certain day of the solar year. But this is rather  a proof of the difficult task an historian takes upon himself, and how easily  authors as trustworthy and learned ‘as Ibnu Sa’id may be led into error by the  adoption of facts which they have not ascertained, or by transcribing the accounts  of over-credulous writers. This phenomenon, which Ibnu Sa’id relates on the  authority of people who are said to have witnessed it, is nothing more than  the effects of light on an olive tree of the common species, as the author of  the Ja’raftyah tells us. We shall quote his words: ‘“ In this mountain (meaning  “that of Sholayr, in the neighbourhood of Granada,) is the famous olive tree  “of which people talk wonders. I happened once to pass by it early in the  “morning of the day of Pentecost, when all the inhabitants of those districts  “collect round it. Isaw nothing on it to deserve attention ; both its appearance  “and its fruit were the same as those of similar trees at that season of the year,  “only that, in proportion as the day advanced, the leaves looked of a bright  “green; at noon they looked white, as if the tree was covered with blossom,  “and later in the day, a little before sunset, they partook of a reddish hue.  “ With the exception of this circumstance, which I believe to be common to  “every tree of the same species, I saw nothing wonderful either in the fruit,  “the branches, or the leaves of the tree.”    ol    Extraordinary  Li    ve tree.    Several authors, and amongst them the last-mentioned writer, describe most Water-clocks    minutely two water-clocks which Abi-l-kasim Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman, known by  the surname of Az-zark4l,'® built in Toledo, when he heard of the famous talisman  which is in the city of Arin in India, and which Mes’idi describes as marking  the time with a hand from sunset to sunrise. These clocks consisted of two  basins, which filled with water or emptied according to the increasing or waning  of the moon. Az-zark4l placed them in a house out of the city, to the south-  west, and on the banks of the river Tajoh (Tagus), near to the spot called Bdbu-I-  VOL. 1. M    ‘oledo.     82 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    dabbdghin'® (the gate of the tanners); their action was as follows. At the  moment when the new moon appeared on the horizon water began to flow into  the basins by means of subterranean pipes, so that there would be at day-break  the fourth of a seventh part, and at the end of the day half,a seventh part, of  the water required to fill the basins. In this proportion the water would  continue to flow until seven days and as many nights of the month were  elapsed, when both basins would be half filled; the same process during the  following seven days and nights would make the two basins quite full, at the  same time that the moon was at its full. However, on the fifteenth night  of the month, when the moon began to wane, the basins would also begin to  lose every day and night half a seventh part of their water, until by the twenty-  first of the month they would be half empty, and when the moon reached her  twenty-ninth night not a drop of water would remain in them; it being worthy  of remark that, should any one go to any of the basins when they were not  filled, and pour water into them with a view to quicken its filling, the basins  would immediately absorb the additional water, and retain no more than the  just quantity ; and, on the contrary, were any one to try, when they were nearly  filled, to extract any or the whole of their water, the moment he raised his  hands from the work the basins would pour out sufficient water to fill the  vacuum in an instant. These clocks were undoubtedly a greater work of science  than the Indian talisman, for this latter is placed in a country under the equinoctial  line, where the days and nights are of the same length, while in Andalus, which  is in the temperate zone, it does not happen thus. They remained for a long  time in Toledo, until that city was taken by the Christians, (may God send  confusion amongst them!) when the tyrant Al-fonsh™® (Alfonso) felt a great  curiosity to know how they were regulated, and caused one of them to be  excavated, which being done the interior machinery was damaged, and the  water ceased to flow into the basins. This happened in the year five hundred  and twenty-eight of the Hijra (a. p. 1133-4).27 Others say that the cause  of their being spoilt was Honeyn the Jew, he who conveyed all the baths  of Andalus to Toledo in one day in the said year of five hundred and twenty-  eight, and who predicted to Alfonso™* that his son would conquer Cordova,  as it happened. This accursed Jew, being anxious to discover the motion of  the clocks, said once to Alfonso, ‘‘O king! were I to look at them in  “the inside, and see how they are made, not only could I restore them to  * their ancient state, but even construct two others still more wonderful, and  “‘which would fill during the day and empty at night.” Alfonso granted     CHAP. VI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 83    him his request, and the Jew then had one opened; but when he afterwards  tried to restore it to its former state he was unable to accomplish what he  had promised, and the machinery being damaged the works were stopped.  The other basin, nevertheless, continued still to fill and empty in the same  wonderful manner; but God is all-knowing,—he knows the truth of the  matter.",book_1,chapter_6

Sultén of  Maghreb and Andalus, crossed the Straits, and landed in the latter country,—  when he had traversed it in all directions, and observed its shape and configuration,  he compared it to an eagle, making the city of Toledo the claws, Kal’at-Rabdh  (Calatrava) the breast, Jaen the head, Granada the bill, and placing its two wings,  the right far into the west, and the left in the east.   We have also read that the said Sultan and the Africans who formed his court  were very much struck with the beauty of the prospect, the fertility of the land, the  abundance of provisions, the mildness of the temperature, the magnificence of its  buildings, and other advantages which make Andalus superior to any other  country in the world, and that their admiration gave rise to many witty ex-  pressions and curious anecdotes in which the African histories abound ; but  unluckily the work in which we have read these and other particulars is not in our  possession, as we have left it with the remainder of our library in the Al-maghreb  (West), so we must content ourselves with quoting that which we know by heart,  and fill up the deficiency with such works as we have been able to procure in  this country.

This, united to the habits of the Andalusians,  “who, instead of living together, as the Egyptians do, grouped in towns and  “ villages, prefer dwelling in cottages and rural establishments in the midst of  “the fields, by the side of brooks, and on the declivities of mountains, gives  “altogether to the country an aspect of comfort and prosperity which the tra-  “ veller will look for in vain elsewhere; their houses too, which they are  “ continually white-washing inside and out, look exceedingly well by the side of  “the green trees, and, to use the words of the famous Wizir and poet Ibnu-l-  “ himarah* in his description of Andalus—   ‘ Its hamlets brightening among the trees look like so many pearls set in   ‘a bed of emeralds.’   “ And he was right, for if thou goest to Egypt after having staid any length of  “time in Andalus, thou wilt be surprised to see the wretched appearance of the  “ Egyptian villages, placed as they are at great distances one from another, with  “ their narrow, badly constructed, ill-shaped houses, looking gloomy and dismal to  “the eye. In Andalus, on the contrary, the traveller will find many districts  “ where large cities and populous towns almost touch each other, without counting  “the numberless villages, hamlets, farms, castles, and towers which lie between.  “So, for instance, going out of Seville, the first day’s march will take him to  “ Sherish (Xerez), a very handsome city, placed in the midst of a fertile territory,  “and surrounded by villages ; close to Xerez is Algesiras, and then comes Malaga,  “one of the finest ports in the Mediterranean ; and let not the reader suppose that  “this excessive population is only to be met with in that particular district, for  “the description is applicable, as well, to any other province of Andalus, this  “ being the reason why historians and geographers who have described this country  “mention so many large cities and wealthy towns. Most of these are strongly  “ fortified, and surrounded with walls, as a protection against the incursions of the  “enemy ; some, even, will be found so strong by nature, or so well fortified by  “art, as to have been besieged by the Christians during twenty years without  “ falling into their hands. This, indeed, is not so much owing to the strength of  “ their fortifications as to the undaunted courage of their defenders,—their aptitude  “ for all military exercises, to which they are trained from their infancy, and their  “ early and continual acquaintance with the perils and horrors of war, owing to  “the proximity of the enemy with whom they are in perpetual hostility. To this  “ must be added the facility they possess of keeping their corn for several years in     86 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book 1.    “ subterranean granaries, owing to which any city might, if necessary, stand a  “ siege of one hundred years; and what I state here concerning the strength of  “ their cities is applicable not only to the prosperous times of Isl4m, but even  ‘to the present disastrous epoch ; for although it is true that at the time I write  “ the enemy of God has penetrated far into the heart of Andalus, and considerably  ‘« diminished the dominions of the Moslems,‘ yet there are still remaining in the  “‘ hands of the true believers cities like Seville, Granada, Malaga, Almeria, and  “ others, ruling over extensive and populous districts, full of cities and towns,  ‘© and provided with sufficient strength to resist and defeat, with God’s help and  “ assistance, all the attacks of the unbelievers.”   Alas! the bright hopes of this holy man have been blighted, and his good  wishes frustrated, for God Almighty had decreed that the contrary should happen,  and that the worshippers of the crucified should every where subdue and over-  power his own servants. Such was the will of God—Him who can change  sorrow into joy, and pain into delight—the high! the great! May He permit  in his infinite wisdom that the words of Islém resound again in Andalus, and that  its present inhabitants be annihilated and destroyed !   But to return to Ibnu Sa’id’s account. ‘I shall conclude,” says that most  elegant of writers, “ by stating one thing in praise of Andalus which will establish  “its fame much better than any. thing else I can say. When I quitted it I  “travelled along the northern coast of Africa, and visited its great cities, such  “as Marékash (Morocco), Fez, and Ceuta; I afterwards went to Africa proper,  “‘ and the neighbouring districts of the Maghrebu-l-ausatt (middle West), and saw  ‘« Tehdmah, Bejdyeh, and Tiinis ; from thence I proceeded to Egypt, and resided  ‘‘in Alexandria, Cairo, and Fostat; I then went to Syria, and entered Damascus,  ‘* Aleppo, and other intervening cities. Well, I must confess that in the course  “‘ of my rambles I saw no country whatever which could be compared to Andalus  ‘‘ either in beauty, fertility, abundance of water, or luxuriance of trees, with the  “ exception of the environs of Fez in the Maghrebu-l-aksd (remote West), and the  “‘ country round Damascus in Syria. Neither did I see in the East or West any city  ‘‘ which could compete with those of Andalus in the size and solidity of its buildings, |  “for nowhere could I find such magnificent edifices and public works as I saw in  ‘‘ almost every city of Andalus, unless it be some of the works lately raised at  “* Morocco by the Sultans of the dynasty of the Beni ’Abdu-l-mimen, and perhaps  “one or two at Tiinis, where all the houses are built of stone as in Alexandria,  ‘Cowing to the great quantity of ancient stones (dug out from the ruins), only  “that the streets of Tunis are not so well levelled or so broad as those of  “that city. Great buildings may also be found in Alexandria; Aleppo may     CHAP. VII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 87    “ likewise be placed in the number of well-built cities, for the good design and  “interior accommodation of its houses, which are built of hard stone, but no-  “where did I find combined the elegance, the magnificence, the excellent distri-  “ bution, of the houses all over Andalus.” .   To this account of the population of Andalus by Ibnu Sa’id we think it proper  to add what an anonymous writer says on the subject.   ‘* Andalus contains eighty cities of the first order, and upwards of three hundred  ‘of moderate size; as to its towns, villages, hamlets, castles, and towers, their  “number is so considerable that God only can count them. It is stated that the  “towns and villages on the banks of the Guadalquivir only amounted to no less  “ than twelve thousand ; * and Andalus is generally believed to be the only country  “in the world where a traveller meets with three, four, or even more cities in the  “* course of a day’s ride; finding besides at every two parasangs springs of limpid  “ water, and villages with markets and shops well provided with bread, fruit, meat,  “ fish, cheese, and all sorts of provisions.”    The before-mentioned author (Ibnu Sa’id) says in another part of his work that Productions of    Andalus far outstrips every other country in the world in the fertility of the land,  which yields abundant crops of all kinds ; in the delicacy of its fruits, the riches of  its mines, the wonderful productions of nature, and the number of its manufactures.  We shall now proceed to bestow on each of these topics such information as  scattered in the authors that we have consulted.   Andalus has been compared by many authors to a terrestrial paradise ; some even  go so far as to advance that God, having forbidden the Christians the entrance into  the celestial paradise, had given them instead one in this world ; for indeed by what  other name can we designate the countries which the Christians inhabit from the  gulf of Constantinople down to the ocean of Andalus; since they are well known  to be a perpetual paradise, wherein the acorn, the filbert, the nut, the chesnut, and  other fruits of the northern climate, grow at the same time with the banana, the  sugar cane, and others which are the productions of warmer countries alone?  Andalus is the country which has been most favoured by God, and in point  of fruits and other produce of the land even the most fertile regions of India  cannot compete with it. The sugar cane grows in great luxuriance all along its  southern coast, and in more temperate® regions the banana and other delicious  fruits. In general, except dates, which do not thrive, all the fruits of other  climates may be found in abundance, as well as many which are either scarce, or  not produced at all, in other countries, such as the two species of figs called Al-iitt{  and Ash-sha’rl, which grow in the neighbourhood of Seville, as we have stated  elsewhere, and which Ibnu Sa’id says he never saw any where out of Andalus,     88 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK I.    nor ever tasted after his departure from that country. The same might be said of  the Malaga fig, or the raisins of Almufiecar, or those called al-’aselt (sweet as  honey), the peaches, the apricots, the pomegranate called Safart,’ the walnuts,  almonds, and several other fruits which grow in great perfection, and which we  shall not stop to enumerate and describe for fear of making this our work too  long.   Another of the productions for which Andalus is famous is its aromatic woods  and roots ; in this respect indeed it has often been compared to India, that privileged  country of drugs and perfumes, which it resembles in some of its productions, as for  instance the mahleb,® that sweetest of all perfumes and choicest of drugs, which is  only to be met with in India and in Andalus, and which, according to Ar-rézi, is  found in great abundance in the western districts. Ibnu Ghalib, quoting the words  of Al-mes’tdi in his Golden Meadows, says that in Andalus are found five-and-  twenty different perfumes or odoriferous substances, such as spikenard, clove,  gillyflower, sandal wood, cinnamon, Kassdbu-dh-dhartrah,? mahleb, and others, and  that out of the five substances which are considered to be the principal ingredients  of perfumes, viz. musk, camphor, aloe wood, saffron, and amber, the two last  are found in great quantities in Andalus. Ar-rézi also, after describing some of  the properties attributed to the mahleb, says that in the district of Dalayah (Dalia),  which falls within the jurisdiction of the Alpuxarras, grows a root called At-tdélaj,!°  which yields not to the Indian aloes in fragrancy ; and which, he adds, grows in  the crevices of rocks, and was collected for the use of Kheyrdn, the Sclavonian king  of Almeria, who liked its smell exceedingly. Kost"" (costum) and spikenard  grow also in great abundance, and the gentian, which is exported to all parts of  the world, is held in great estimation for the sweetness of its smell, and commands  a very high price. Myrrh is found in great quantities in the neighbourhood of  Calatayud ; and various authors speak of a plant with which the mountains near  Ossonoba are covered, and which when burnt sends forth a smell similar to that  of the aloe wood. This account is confirmed by Ibnu Sa’id, who says that there  are in Andalus several mountains covered with odoriferous plants and shrubs, where  if a fire be lighted the air becomes impregnated with a fragrant smell very much  resembling that of burnt aloe wood, and that in the mountain of Sholayr, in that  part which is nearest to Granada, grow many of the plants that are peculiar to India.   Respecting amber, it is found in great abundance all along the western coast of  Andalus,'* especially at Shidhiinah (Sidonia), where it is particularly fine, and  very much prized, owing to its good quality and its resistance when exposed to  the fire. It is known in the East by the name of Al-gharbt (western), and according  to Al-mes’tidi one drachm of it sold in his time for several drachms of that     CHAP. VII.] | DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 89    produced in other countries. But let us hear what Al-mes’tidi himself says in his  Golden Meadows. ‘‘ The seas that wash the shores of Andalus, and especially the  ‘“ Mediterranean, abound in amber, which is exported fo Egypt and to other  “countries. That which they use at Cordova comes from a place on the western  “coast called Shantareyn (Santarem), as also from Shidénah (Sidonia). One  “ ounce of this amber is sold in Andalus for three gold mithcals—in Egypt it may be  “procured for twenty gold dinars, although inferior in quality: the ounce used in  “ Andalus is equal in weight to that of Baghdid. As to the pieces of amber which  “ are now and then picked up on the coasts of Egypt, it is probable that they come  “ from the Mediterranean, and are impelled there by the waves. Andalus abounds  “in mines of silver and quicksilver, which have not their equal any where in the  “world, either in the countries subject to the Moslems, or in those which the  “infidels occupy. It produces also ginger root, saffron, and several other aromatic  “ roots, as well as five kinds of musk; aloes and camphor may also be pro-  “cured, although they do not grow in the country, being imported in great  “ quantities from India.”   The preceding has been transcribed from Al-mes’tidi’s work ;“ for although he  adds nothing new to what we have already stated, yet his account is not altogether  devoid of interest. About the formation of amber very little is known; some  authors, like Ibnu Sa’id, believing it to be the saliva and excrements of marine  monsters, while others, like Ibnu-l-hijéri, say that it is a plant growing at the  bottom of the sea.   Mines of gold, silver, and other metals, abound in Andalus; according to the Mines.  author of the Ja’raftyah there are three places from which, during the occupation of  that country by the Moslems, gold was extracted in great quantities ; one was the  river Daroh (Darro), the other a spot on the western coast close to Lisbon and at  the mouth of the Tajoh (Tagus), and a third in the river of Lerida, that which falls  into the Ebro.'® According to Ibnu Sa’id mines of all the seven known metals ®  were to be found in the north and north-west of Andalus, in those countries which  were in the hands of the infidels. ‘ The richest gold mine in all Andalus,” says  that author, ‘‘ is in the neighbourhood of the city of Santiago, the capital of  “Galicia. Silver is also very common ; it may be procured near Tudmir, and in  “the mountains of Al-hamah,!7 near Bejénah, and in the neighbourhood of  “ Kartash,!® a town belonging to the district of Cordova. At Ossonoba’® are  “ mines of tin, a metal very much resembling silver; it is also found in great  “abundance in the country of the Franks and at Liyén (Leon). The Pyrenees  ‘are likewise full of that metal as well as of quicksilver.”   Mines of red and yellow ochre were also very abundant, and in a village close   VOL. 1. N     Precious  stones.    90 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (BooK I.    to Vera, called Baternah (Paterna), was found excellent tutty, which was used in  giving colour to copper. Tutty was also met with in the mountains near Cordova,  but inferior in quality to that of Paterna. In the neighbourhood of Tortosa were  mines of collyrium, as good as that of Isfahén, and of which large quantities were  annually exported ; quicksilver abounded in the territory of ‘Cordova, lead near  Almeria, copper in the north, as also a kind of metal called as-sofar,"" which very.  much resembles gold ; as to those of alum” and iron, they were so numerous that  it would be a difficult task to mention them all. The foregoing account of the  mineral riches of Andalus has been for the most part extracted from the works of  Ar-razi.   Other writers assert that the primitive inhabitants of Andalus called every one  of the seven known metals after the name of that planet which was known to  exercise an influence over it,—for instance, they called lead, Saturn ; tin, Jupiter ;  iron, Vulcan; gold, the Sun; copper, Venus; ‘silver, the Moon; and quicksilver,  Mercury.   A great variety of precious stones was likewise found in Andalus, according  to the accounts of different writers: for instance, not far from a place called  Hadhratu-l-warikah,® in the jurisdiction of Cordova, as likewise in the mountain  of Shaheyrén,* to the east of Beyra (Vera), are mines of beryl.% Rubies  may be found near the castle of Montemayér,% in the province of Malaga,  only they are very small, which makes them very difficult to be worked. The  golden marcasite, which has not its equal in the world, is extracted from the  mountains of Ubeda,” and is exported to all distant countries on account of  its beauty, as also another stone called Al-ma’tisisd,®* and talc, which are found  in great quantities. Pearls may be fished in the seas adjoining to Barcelona,  but when they are large they are wanting in transparency and colour; as to  the smaller kind, they are found in such abundance all along the coast of the  Mediterranean, that at Vera, a sea-port in the jurisdiction of Almeria, eighty  arrobes® weight are often collected in less than a month’s time.   In the district of Bejénah, not far from a deep valley called Kariatu Ndsherah,®°  there are quarries of a stone resembling the ruby, of various hues, and which stands  the fire. The magnetes (load-stone), which is well known to possess the property  of attracting iron, is found in great abundance in the district of Tudmir, and  close to Lisbon there is a mountain so impregnated with the stone called  An-najddt*! that the whole place looks at night as if it were illuminated with  lanterns. The stone called Ash-shddenah* abounds on a mountain in the neighbour-  hood of Cordova—its use in gilding is sufficiently known. The stone called  Jewish stone,* which is acknowledged by all the physicians to be the most     CHAP. VII.] ‘ DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 91    efficacious remedy for pains in the kidneys and in the bladder, is dug out in the  environs of Hisnu-l-bénah ; and the territory round Lorca, a city belonging to the  district of Tudmir, is full of mines of lapis-lazuli of the finest quality, which rare  and precious article may also be found in other parts of Andalus.   We cannot pass in silence the spring of Liblah (Niebla), which pours out  glass* of the best quality ; nor a mountain in the neighbourhood of Toledo called  Jebalu-t-tafal, where tafal,* surpassing in quality any other in the East or West,  grows in prodigious quantity.   Andalus is equally rich in marbles, and stones for building. Ar-rdzi says that Marbies.  the mountains of Cordova abound in marbles of all sorts and colours, such as the  purest white without any spot, and that having the colour of wine; the green is  also to be found in the Alpuxarras in large blocks, from which columns are cut;  and in the neighbourhood of Vega, a town depending on Granada, are several  quarries of the most exquisite marbles, such as the spotted, the red, the yellow,’ and  others. Almeria is famous for some small pebbles °’ (agates) which are found in  its territory, and which are exported to distant countries, owing to their similarity  to pearls, which they strongly resemble in brightness and transparency. In short,  Andalus is, in the opinion of historians and geographers, the country which abounds  most in marbles and jaspers, white, black, red, and of all colours.   If from the productions of nature, or the fruits of the soil, we pass to the animal Animals.  kingdom, we shall find that Andalus contains a larger number of the animals useful  to man, while it has fewer wild beasts, than any other country in the world; as a  proof of what we advance we shall quote the words of Al-hijari in his Al-mashab.  “ Andalus,” says that author, ‘‘ abounds in antelopes, deer, zebras, oxen, and other  “quadrupeds common to other countries; but there are neither elephants nor  “ giraffes, lions, tigers, nor other beasts of warmer countries ; instead of these we  “have an animal peculiar to our country which we call al-hib** (lupus), somewhat  “larger than a jackal,®® but equally cruel and ferocious, and which, when insti-  “gated by hunger, attacks and devours men. The mules are strong and sure-  “footed, and the horses powerful and swift, and equally fit for sport and for battle,  “enduring fatigue and weight most admirably, since in time of war they will not  “ only carry a cavalier armed cap-a-pié with all his provisions, but be themselves  ‘ caparisoned and barbed in steel.”   Birds of all sorts, whether small or of prey, are found in such quantities, that  were we to stop to enumerate them we should protract this our narrative to an undue  length ; the same might be said of the fishes, and other monsters of the sea, especially  of the Ocean, where many are to be found so prodigiously large that we are afraid  even to guess at their dimensions lest we should still remain far from the truth.     92 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN . [Book I.    Tbnu Sa’id tells us that he once saw one of these monsters, while on a sea voyage,  and that it was so large that the crew of the vessel were trembling lest it should by  a sudden jerk overturn the vessel. ‘We looked at it in amazement,” says Ibnu  Sa’id, ‘‘and were filled with horror and consternation, for a long time unable  “to utter a word, and expecting every moment to be drowned, for whenever  “the monster breathed it raised large columns of water to a height really sur-  “* prising.”   We find likewise in those authors who have written on the natural history of  Andalus that frequent allusion is made to an amphibious quadruped, whose skin is  used as a garment, and whose scrotum is reckoned to be a specific in several  diseases. As the name of this animal is differently written, and there are besides  many extraordinary circumstances attached to it, we shall transcribe here the words  of the different writers who have mentioned it.   Tbnu-l-hijari, in the Al-mashab.—‘‘ The Andalusians make jackets of the skin  “of a certain amphibious quadruped called al-wabrah* (seal), whose skin is very  “‘ much prized ; they are found in great abundance on the shores of the Ocean, and  ‘in that part of Andalus which faces the island of Britannia. Thence they are  “ brought to Saragossa, where the skins are dressed, and then made into jackets.”   Tbnu Ghalib, mentioning these jackets, which he observes were also manufactured  at Cordova, says ‘‘ the skins here alluded to and called samir*! are very much used  “ in Cordova for jackets, but am unable to say to what animal they belong, whether  ‘to some quadruped peculiar to that country, or to the wabrah (seal) ; in case of  “ their being those of the latter animal, it is a well-known amphibious quadruped,  ““ very strong and muscular.”   But the best account is that given by Hamid Ibn Samjiin*? the physician, in his  work on the simples employed as remedies in medicine. It reads thus: “‘ the seal is  “‘a quadruped whose scrotum is used as a remedy in several diseases ; they abound  “in the Mediterranean, where they generally live in the water, although they often  “‘ come on shore, and are pursued by huntsmen, who catch them, and after cutting  “« off their scrotum, let them go. I have heard the people who practise this trade say  “ that if one of these quadrupeds happens to fall a second time into their hands,  ‘* he fails not to throw himself on his back, to show his pursuers that he no longer  ‘« has the object of their wishes, upon which the men let him go unhurt.” *   Another author says that the remedy to which we allude is also called jendu-bd-  dastar, from the animal’s name, which is likewise jendu-bddastar ;“ that it is con-  sidered a great specific in all diseases originating from cold temperaments, on  account of its being held by the physicians and naturalists as hot and dry in  the fourth degree. Some say that in size this quadruped is like a hare, 6thers     CHAP. VII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 93    that he is somewhat smaller, and that his flesh has a better taste ; others again make  him much larger,—but God only knows ; one thing is certain, that the skins of the  wabrah (seal), or some other quadruped resembling it, were used as an article  of dress, and much worn by Christians as well as Moslems.   But it is quite time that we should say a few words about the different manufac- Manufactures.  tures that existed in Andalus, which are generally acknowledged to have reached the  utmost degree of perfection, so much so that when an Andalusian begins upon this  subject there is no end to his praises of his native land: we shall here slightly  mention a few; as, for instance, its manufactures of sashes,** which were famous  all over the world for brilliancy of colours and fineness of texture ; its silver and  gold tissues manufactured at Almeria, Malaga, and Murcia, with such perfection  that when taken to Eastern countries the people were amazed and bewildered  at the sight of them. Of the manufactures established at Almeria we have  already spoken elsewhere, when we gave the description of that city; we shall  only add here, by way of supplement, that all the stuffs woven by its industrious  inhabitants were at all times in great demand in the East and West, and that a  very considerable trade was carried on in this, as well as in other products of their  industry, both with Moslems and Christians. At Tentala, a town depending on  Murcia, there were manufactures of carpets called Tental{,“© which, when exported  to the East, brought a very high price. Both Granada and Baza were famous for  the manufacture of certain warm stuffs for winter called Al-mulabbad,”—they were  generally of woollen, stamped,*® and dyed of the most beautiful and delicate colours.  Murcia was likewise famous for the manufacture of coats of mail, breast-plates, and  all sorts of steel armour, inlaid with gold; saddles and horse-harness richly set in  gold; all kinds of instruments of brass and iron, as knives, scissors, and other  trinkets, inlaid with gold, such as are used in weddings to present to the bride; and,  above all, weapons and other warlike instruments, which were so highly finished  and wrought in such perfection as to dazzle with their brightness the eyes of the  beholder.*® All these articles, Tbnu Sa’id informs us, were exported to Africa and  other more distant countries, where they were held in great estimation. Murcia  was likewise renowned for the fabrication of glass and pottery, of both which  materials they made large vases of the most exquisite and elegant shapes; they  manufactured also glazed pottery, and another kind which was washed over with  gold. The manufactures of Malaga have already been described by us under the  head of that city ; it was famous above all things for its glass and pottery, and for  many articles of clothing.   We find also that there were in Andalus several manufactures of al-mafssass,°°  which is known in the East by the name of al-foseyfasd (mosaic), as well as of a sort     94 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK 1.    of tile called az-zulaj*! (azulejo), which they used in paving the floors of their  houses. The azulejos were made of all sorts of gay colours, and very much re-  sembled the al-mafssass; they were exported in great quantities to the East, and  used instead of marble flags to make mosaic floors, to pave fountains, and other  similar ornaments.   As to weapons and military stores of all kinds, such as shields, swords, spears,  helmets, breast-plates, bows, arrows, saddles, bits, bridles, and all kinds of horse-  trappings, the manufactures of Andalus exceeded those of any other country in the  world ; and according to Ibnu Sa’id (from whom the preceding narrative is abridged)  that part of the country which was in the hands of the infidels was likewise famous  for the manufacture of arms, so highly polished as to dazzle the eyes; amongst  which he makes particular mention of certain sharp-edged, well-tempered swords,  called al-bordheliat, from Bordhil (Bourdeaux), a city placed at the north-eastern  extremity of Andalus. The same author speaks in the highest terms of the swords  manufactured at Seville, and which, he says, were not inferior to those of India.  Seville is likewise represented by him as a city of great trade, and where several  manufactures of rich clothing and costly articles existed. . The town of Xativa, near  Valencia, was well known for its paper manufactures, of which a large quantity was  annually exported to Maghreb, and to other parts of Africa. But we shall not  dwell any longer on this topic, inasmuch as we have already given some details,  under the head of those cities and districts where the objects were manufactured,  and we may again occasionally allude to them in the course of this our narrative.",book_1,chapter_7

Havine thus far sketched some of the peculiarities of Andalus, we shall now Government.  proceed to say a few words on its government and institutions, as well as on the  customs and manners of its inhabitants. Our narrative will be mostly borrowed  from Tbnu Sa’id, an author who has treated the question at large in his Kitdbu-l-  mugh’rab, in a chapter entitled ‘‘ Shining stars in the just and impartial descrip-  tion of the eastern and western governments.”! These are that author’s words :  “ Andalus, which was conquered in the year 92 of the Hijra, continued for many  “years to be a dependency of the Eastern Khalifate, until it was snatched away  “from their hands by one of the surviving members of the family of Umeyyah,  “ who, crossing over from Barbary, subdued the country, and formed therein an  ""independent kingdom, which he transmitted to his posterity. During three  “centuries and a half, Andalus, governed by the princes of this dynasty, reached the  “utmost degree of power and prosperity, until civil war breaking out among its  “ inhabitants, the Moslems, weakened by internal discord, became every where the  “ prey of the artful Christians, and the territory of Islim was considerably reduced,  “so much so that at the present moment the worshippers of the crucified hold  “the greatest part of Andalus in their hands, and their country is divided into  “ various powerful kingdoms, whose rulers assist each other whenever the Moslems  “attack their territories. This brings to my recollection the words of an eastern  ‘‘ geographer who visited Andalus in the fourth century of the Hijra,? and during  “the prosperous times of the Cordovan Khalifate, I mean Ibnu Haukal An-  “nassibi,> who, describing Andalus, speaks in very unfavourable terms of its  “inhabitants. As his words require refutation I shall transcribe here the whole  ‘of the passage. ‘ Andalus,’ he says, ‘is an extensive island, a little less than a  “month’s march in length, and twenty and odd days in width. It abounds in     96 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    “    rivers and springs, is covered with trees and plants of every description, and is  “ amply provided with every article which adds to the comforts of life; slaves are  “« very fine, and may be procured for a small price on account of their abundance ;  “ owing, too, to the fertility of the land, which yields all sorts of grain, vegetables,  “and fruit, as well as to the number and goodness of its pastures in which innu-  merable flocks of cattle graze, food is exceedingly abundant and cheap, and the  inhabitants are thereby plunged into indolence and sloth, letting mechanics and  men of the lowest ranks of society overpower them and conduct their affairs.  Owing to this it is really astonishing how the Island of Andalus still remains in  the hands of the Moslems, being, as they are, people of vicious habits and low  inclinations, narrow-minded, and entirely devoid of fortitude, courage, and the  military accomplishments necessary to meet face to face the formidable nations of  Christians who surround them on every side, and by whom they are continually  “ assailed.’ *   “Such are the words of Ibnu Haukal; but, if truth be told, I am at a loss  to guess to whom they are applied. To my countrymen they certainly are  not ; or, if so, it is a horrible calumny, for if any people on the earth are famous  “ for their courage, their noble qualities, and good habits, it is the Moslems of  Andalus ; and indeed their readiness to fight the common enemy, their con-  stancy in upholding the holy tenets of, their religion, and their endurance of  the hardships and privations of war, have become almost proverbial. So, as  far as this goes, Ibnu Haukal is decidedly in error, for as the proverb says,  ‘the tongue of stammering is at times more eloquent than the tongue of  eloquence.’* As to the other imputation, namely, their being devoid of all  sense, wisdom, and talent, either in the field or in administration, would to  God that the author’s judgment were correct, for then the ambition of the  chiefs would not have been raised, and the Moslems would not have turned  against each other’s breasts and dipped in each other’s blood those very  ‘“* weapons which God Almighty put into their hands for the destruction and  “ annihilation of the infidel Christian. But, as it is, we ask—were those Sultans  and Khalifs wanting in prudence and talents who governed this country for  upwards of five hundred years, and who administered its affairs in the midst  of foreign war and civil discord? Were those fearless warriors deficient in  courage and military science who withstood on the frontiers of the Moslem  empire the frightful shock of the innumerable infidel nations who dwell within  and out of Andalus, whose extensive territories cover a surface of three months’  march, and all of whom ran to arms at a moment’s notice to defend the religion  “‘ of the crucified? And if it be true that at the moment I write the Moslems     CHAP. VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. , 97    “have been visited by the wrath of heaven, and that the Almighty has sent down  “defeat and shame to their arms, are we to wonder at it at a time when the  “Christians, proud of their success, have carried their arms as far as Syria  “and Mesopotamia, have invaded the districts contiguous to the country which  “is the meeting-place of the Moslems, and the cupola of Islam, committed all  “sorts of ravages and depredations, conquered the city of Haleb (Aleppo) and  “its environs, and done other deeds which are sufficiently declared in the  “histories of the time? No, it is by no means to be wondered at, especially  “when proper attention is paid to the manner in which the Andalusian Moslems  ‘have come to their present state of weakness and degradation. The process  “is this: the Christians will rush down from their mountains, or across the  “plain, and make an incursion into the Moslem territory ; there they will  “ pounce upon a castle and seize it; they will ravage the neighbouring country,  “take the inhabitants captive, and then retire to their country with all the  “plunder they have collected, leaving, nevertheless, strong garrisons in the  “castles and towers captured by them. In the meanwhile the Moslem king  “in whose dominions the inroad has been made, instead of attending to his  “own interests and stopping the disease by applying cauterization, will be  “waging war against his neighbours of the Moslems; and these, instead of  “defending the common cause, the cause of religion and truth,—instead of  “assisting their brother, will confederate and ally to deprive him of whatever  “dominions still remain in his hands. So, from a trifling evil at first, it will  “grow into an irreparable calamity, and the Christians will advance farther  “and farther until they subdue the whole of that country exposed to their  “inroads, where, once established and fortified, they will direct their attacks  “to another part of the Moslem territories, and carry on the same war of havoc  “and destruction. Nothing of this, however, existed at the time when Ibnu  “Haukal visited Andalus; for although we are told by Ibnu Hayydn and  “other writers that the Christians began as early as the reign of ’Abdu-r-  “rahmén III. to grow powerful, and to annoy the Moslems on the frontiers,’  “vet it is evident that until the breaking out of the civil wars, which raged  “with uncommon violence throughout Andalus, the encroachments of the  “barbarians on the extensive and unprotected frontiers of the Moslem empire  “were but of little consequence.   “ But to return to our subject. During the first years after the conquest the  “government of Andalus was vested in the hands of military commanders  “appointed by the Viceroys of Africa, who were themselves named by the  “ Khalifs of Damascus. These governors united in their hands the command   VOL. 1. 0     98 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    ‘‘of the armies and the civil power, but, being either removed as soon as  “named, or deposed by military insurrections, much confusion and disorder  ‘reigned at all times in the state, and the establishment and consolidation  “of the Moslem power in Andalus were thwarted in their progress at the  “very onset. It was not until the arrival of the Beni Umeyyah in Andalus  “that the fabric of Islim may be said to have rested on a solid foundation.  “When ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Mu’awiyeh had conquered the country, when every  ‘‘ rebel had submitted to him, when all his opponents had sworn allegiance to  “him, and his authority had been universally acknowledged, then his importance  “increased, his ambition spread wider, and both he and his successors displayed  “the greatest magnificence in their court, and about their persons and retinue,  “‘as likewise in the number of officers and great functionaries of the state. At  “first they contented themselves with the title of Beni-I-khaldyif (sons of  “the Khalifs),® but in process of time, when the limits of their empire had  “‘ been considerably extended by their conquests on the opposite land of Africa,  “they took the appellation of Khalifs and Omard-l-mimenin (Princes of the  “ believers). It is generally known that the strength and solidity of their  ‘“‘ empire consisted principally in the policy pursued by these princes, the mag-  “ nificence and splendour with which they surrounded their court, the reverential  “ awe with which they inspired their subjects, the inexorable rigour with which they  “« chastised every aggression on their rights, the impartiality of their judgments,  “ their ‘anxious solicitude in the observance of the civil law, their regard and  “attention to the learned, whose opinions they respected and followed, calling  ‘them to their sittings and admitting them to their councils, and many other  ‘ brilliant qualities; in proof of which frequent anecdotes occur in the works.  ‘of Ibnu Hayydn and other writers; as, for instance, that whenever a judge  “ summoned the Khalif, his son, or any of his most beloved favourites, to appear  “in his presence as a witness in a judicial case, whoever was the individual  “ summoned would attend in person—if the Khalif, out of respect for the law  “—and if a subject, for fear of incurring his master’s displeasure.   “ But when this salutary awe and impartial justice had vanished, the decay  “of their empire began, and it was followed by a complete ruin. I have already  “‘ observed that the princes of that dynasty were formerly styled Omard-bnd-l-  “ kholafé (Amirs, sons of the Khalifs),° but that in latter times they assumed  “the title of Omard-l-mimenin (Princes of the believers). This continued until  “the disastrous times of the civil war, when the surviving members of the  “ royal family hated each other, and when those who had neither the nobility  “nor the qualities required to honour the Khalifate pretended to it and wished     CHAP. VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 99    “for it; when the governors of provinces and the generals of armies declared  “themselves independent and rose every where in their governments, taking  “the title of Moliku-t-tawdyif!° (Kings of small estates), and when confusion  “and disorder were at their highest pitch. These petty sovereigns, of whom  “some read the khotbah™ for the Khalifs of the house of Merwan—in whose  “hands no power whatsoever remained—while others proclaimed the Abbasside  “ Sultans, and acknowledged their Imam, all began to exercise the powers and  “to use the appendages of royalty, assuming even the titles and names of  “former Khalifs, and imitating in every thing the bearing and splendour of  “the most powerful sovereigns,—a thing which they were enabled to accomplish  “from the great resources of the countries over which they ruled,—for although  ‘“ Andalus was divided into sundry petty kingdoms, yet such was the fertility  “of the land, and the amount of taxes collected from it, that the chief of a  “limited state could at times display at his court a greater magnificence than  “the ruler of extensive dominions. However, the greatest among them did  “not hesitate to assume, as I have already observed, the names and titles of  “the most famous Eastern Khalifs ; for instance, Ibnu Rashik Al-kairwani'? says  “that ’Abbéd Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abbdd took the surname of Al-mu’atadhed,  “and imitated in all things the mode of life and bearing of the Abbasside Khalif  “ Al-mu’atadhed-billah ; * his son, Mohammed Ibn ’Abbad, was styled Al-  “mu’atamed; both reigned in Seville, to which kingdom they in process of  “time added Cordova and other extensive territories in the southern and western  “ parts of Andalus, as will hereafter be shown.   “As long as the dynasty. of Umeyyah occupied the throne of Cordova, the  “successors of ’Abdu-r-rahman contrived to inspire their subjects with love of  “their persons, mixed with reverential awe; this they accomplished by sur-  “rounding their courts with splendour, by displaying the greatest magnificence  “ whenever they appeared in public, and by employing other means which I have  “ already hinted at, and deem it not necessary to repeat: they continued thus until  “the times of the civil war, when, having lost the affections of the people, their  “ subjects began to look with an evil eye at their prodigal expense, and the extra-  “vagant pomp with which they surrounded their persons. Then came the Beni  “ Hamid,’ the descendants of Idris, of the progeny of ’Ali Ibn Abi Talib, who,  “ having snatched the Khalifate from the hands of the Beni Merwan, ruled for some  “ time over the greatest part of Andalus. These princes showed also great osten-  “ tation, and, assuming the same titles that the Abbasside Khalifs had borne, they  “ followed their steps in every thing concerning the arrangement of their courts  “and persons ; for instance, whenever a munshid'® wanted to extemporize some     100 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    “verses in praise of his sovereign, or any subject wished to address him on  “ particular business, the poet or the petitioner was introduced to the presence of  “* the Khalif, who sat behind a curtain and spoke without showing himself, the Hdjib  “ or curtain-drawer standing all the time by his side to communicate to the party  “the words or intentions of the Khalif. So when Ibnu Mokéné Al-lishboni  “ (from Lisbon), the poet, appeared in presence of the Hajib of Idris Ibn Yahya  ‘* Al-hamidi, who was proclaimed Khalif at Malaga,’® to recite that kassidah of his  “‘ which is so well known and rhymes in min, when he came to that part which  “runs thus—  ‘ The countenance of Idris, son of Yahya, son of ’Ali, son of Hamid, prince  ‘of the believers, is like a rising sun; it, dazzles the eyes of those who look  ‘at it—  ‘ Let us see it, let us seize the rays of yonder light, for it is the light of the  ‘ master of the worlds ’—'7  “the Sultan himself drew the curtain which concealed him, and said to the  “ poet—‘ Look, then,’ and showed great affability to Ibn Mokénd, and rewarded  “him very handsomely.  ‘* But when, through the civil war, the country was broken up into sundry petty  “* sovereignties, the new monarchs followed quite a different line of politics ; for,  ‘‘ wishing to become popular, they treated their subjects with greater familiarity,  “and had a more frequent intercourse with all classes of society; they often  ‘ reviewed their troops, and visited their provinces ; they invited to their presence  “‘ the doctors and poets, and wished to be held from the beginning of their reign as  ‘the patrons of science and literature: but even this contributed to the depression  “* of the royal authority, which thus became every day less dreaded ; besides, the  “arms of the Moslems being employed during the long civil wars against one  “another, the inhabitants of the different provinces began to look on each other  “‘ with an evil eye ; the ties by which they were united became loose, and a number  “* of independent states were formed, the government of which passed from father to  ‘son, in the same manner as the empire of Cordova had been transmitted to  “‘ the sons and heirs of the Khalifs. Thus separated from each other, the Moslems  “‘ began to consider themselves as members of different nations, and it became  ‘“‘ every day more difficult for them to unite in the common cause; and owing  “ to their divisions, and to their mutual enmity, as well as to the sordid interest and  “ extravagant ambition of some of their kings, the Christians were enabled to attack  “ them in detail, and subdue them one after the other. However, by the arrival of  “the Beni ’Abdu-l-miimen all those little states were again blended into one, and  “ the whole of Andalus acknowledged their sway, and continued for many years to     CHAP. VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 101    ‘‘be ruled by their successors, until, civil war breaking out again, Ibn Hid,  “surnamed Al-mutawdkel,!® revolted, and finding the people of Andalus ill-dis-  “ posed against the Almohades, and anxious to shake off their yoke, he easily made  “himself master of the country. Ibn Hid, however, followed the policy of his  “ predecessors (the kings of the small states); he even surpassed them in folly and  “ ignorance of the rules of good government, for he used to walk about the streets  “and markets, conversing and laughing with the lowest people, asking them  “ questions, and doing acts unsuitable to his high station, and which no subject  “ever saw a Sultan do before, so much so that it was said, not without foun-  “ dation, that he looked more like a performer of legerdemain than a king. Fools,  “and the ignorant vulgar seemed, it is true, to gaze with astonishment and   “pleasure at this familiarity, but as the poet has said—  ‘ These are things to make the fools laugh, but the consequences of which   ‘ prudent people are taught to fear.’ 9   “‘ These symptoms went on increasing until populous cities and extensive dis-  “tricts became the prey of the Christians, and whole kingdoms were snatched  “from the hands of the Moslems. Another very aggravating circumstance added  “its weight to the general calamity, namely, the facility with which the power  “changed hands. Whoever has read attentively what we have just said® about  “the mode of attaining and using the royal power in Andalus, must be convinced  “ that-nothing was so easy, especially in latter times, as to arrive at it. The process  “is this: whenever a knight is known to surpass his countrymen in courage,  “ generosity, or any of those qualities which make a man dear to the vulgar, the  “people cling to him, follow his party, and soon after proclaim him their king,  “without paying the least regard to his ascendancy, or stopping to consider  “whether he is of royal blood or not. The new king then transmits the state as  “an inheritance to his son or nearest relative, and thus a new dynasty is formed. I  “may, in proof of this, quote a case which has just taken place among us: a  “certain captain” made himself famous by his exploits, and the victories he won  “over the enemy, as likewise by his generous and liberal disposition towards  “the citizens and the army; all of a sudden his friends and partisans resolved  “to raise him to the throne, and regardless of their own safety, as well as that  ‘‘of their families, friends, and clients residing at court, and whose lives were  “by their imprudence put in great jeopardy, they rose in a castle, and pro-  “claimed him king ; and they never ceased toiling, calling people to their ranks,  “and fighting their opponents, until their object was accomplished, and their  “ friend solidly established on his throne. Now Eastern people are more cautious  “about altering the succession, and changing the reigning dynasty ; they will on     Wizir.    102 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN F [Book 1.    “ the contrary avoid it by all possible means, and do their best to leave the power  ‘in the hands of the reigning family, rather than let discord and civil dissen-  “sions sap the foundations of the state, and introduce dissolution and corruption  “into the social body.   ‘* Among us the change of dynasty is a thing of frequent occurrence, and the  “‘ present ruler of Andalus, Ibnu-l-ahmar, is another instance of what I have  “advanced. He was a good soldier, and had been very successful in some ex-  “* peditions against the Christians, whose territories he was continually invading,  “ sallying out at the head of his followers from a castle called Hisn-Arjénah  ‘* (Arjona),”” where he generally resided. Being a shrewd man, and versed in all  “the stratagems of war, he seldom went out on an expedition without returning  ‘* victorious, and laden with plunder, owing to which he amassed great riches, and  “ the number of his partisans and followers was considerably increased. At last,  ‘ being prompted by ambition to aspire to the royal power, he at first caused his  “troops to proclaim him king; then sallying out of his stronghold he got  ‘* possession of Cordova, marched against Seville, took it, and killed its king  ‘* Al-baji.% After this he subdued Jaen, the strongest and most important city  ** in all Andalus, owing to its walls and the position it occupies, conquered likewise  ‘“‘ Malaga, Granada, and their districts, and assumed the title of Amfru-l-moslemin  “* (Prince of the Moslems) ; and at the moment I write he is obeyed all over Andalus,   “ and every one looks to him for advice and protection.” *   The preceding has been transcribed from Ibnu Sa’id’s work, where the subject i is  treated at length: we shall now extract from him and from Ibnu Khaldiin some  particulars concerning the charges or public offices which composed the government  of the different dynasties in Andalus.   The charge of Wizir during the times of the Beni Umeyyah was common to  several functionaries, to whose deliberation and inspection the chief of the state  submitted the affairs of the government. The historian, Ibnu Khaldiin, who in his :  book of the subject and attribute has defined the functions of these and other officers  of the court of the Khalifs, says that the title of Wizir, under the Sultans of  Cordova, was given to certain functionaries in whose hands rested the management  of public affairs, and each of whom had under his care one branch of the admi«  nistration ; for instance, the financial department, the foreign relations, the ad-  ministration of justice and redress of injuries, and, lastly, the care of the frontiers  and the provision and equipment of the troops stationed on them, would each  constitute a separate and independent office under the special care of a Wizir.  These functionaries enjoyed besides the right of sitting in the audience-room with  the Khalif, and it was from among them that he chose his Nayib, called in the East     CHAP. VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 103    chief, or grand, Wizir, but who in Andalus was designated by the name of Hajib.  These dignities were moreover conferred on certain noble families, until at last  they became almost like an inheritance ;* so that notwithstanding the governors  and generals, who shared among themselves the dominions of the Khalifs, soon  began to assume the signs of royalty, they still considered the titles of Wizir and  Héjib as a very honourable distinction, and styled themselves Hdjibs of the Beni  Umeyyah, as if they were merely governing their states in their name. Some  even thought that no title could be more honourable, for we see them continually  designated under that appellation either by poets singing their praises, or by  historians relating their actions.   The appellation of Wizir was therefore given to all those who sat in council  with, or were admitted into the privacy of, the sovereign; so that the Wizir,  who to the right of sitting in council united the duties of the administration (in any  particular branch), was distinguished by the title of Dhz-l-wizdrateyn, that is, the  holder of the two offices; and he had therefore to unite to the general accomplish-  ments in literature which were required from the other functionaries a profound  knowledge of the science of government.   The office of Katib or secretary was of two kinds: the most important was called Kitin.  Kitdbatu-r-rasdyil (the office of the correspondence), the chief of which had under  his care the direction of the correspondence of the Sultdn with his allies or enemies,  as likewise the drawing up of orders from the sovereign, and other documents for the  inspection of the subjects : this office was also the most important, and that which  required the greatest abilities in its holder, for he had to write (as it were) in the eyes  and hearts of the people. The second was called Kitdbatu-dh-dhimdm (office of pro-  tection), and corresponded exactly to that of the Kdtibu-l-jihbadheh™ in the East :  the person intrusted with this office had, as its name sufficiently indicates, to attend  to the protection and security of the Christians and Jews ; and it may be said without  exaggeration, that so long as this office subsisted in Andalus and in the Maghreb  no Christian or Jew ever needed the protection and assistance of the great and  powerful. Both these functionaries were called Katibs, a title in which they  gloried, and which they considered as the most honourable which they could  receive; so that whoever wanted to honour or praise them never failed while  addressing them, either verbally or in writing, to call them Katibs ; besides, the  Andalusians showed always the greatest respect for all individuals entitled to that  denomination, and never by any means forgot to do so when they addressed one  of them ; for had any one by mistake or otherwise omitted this, or suppressed any  other of their honorific titles, neither the rank, riches, nor high station of the     Sahibu-l-  ashghal.    Kadi.    Sahibu-sh-    shartah,    104 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN {Book 1.    offender would have prevented him and his friends from being ill-treated in words  or action.   No public office whatever equalled that of the Sdhibu-l-ashghdl, or collector of  taxes, in authority and importance, and the person who was at the head of it was  considered more powerful and influential than a Wizir; he had more followers, and  could count a greater number of friends; the emoluments attached to his place  were also more considerable, all necks bowed before him, all hands were stretched  out to him, and he kept the provinces in awe by means of his overseers and in-  formers. Yet with all this, and though this was a most desirable appointment—  one which gave so much influence and importance to its holder, and in which  considerable riches might be amassed in a very short time—it was a dangerous one,  and full of hazards and cares. But this does not belong to our subject, as it  depends upon the changes of fortune, and the character of the Sultan.   The charge of Kadi was always reputed in Andalus as the most honourable of all,  not only on account of his spiritual jurisdiction, all religious affairs being exclusively  intrusted to his care, but also owing to the great independence and power which  that office gave to its holders ; for, as we have observed elsewhere, if a Kaédi sum-  moned the Khalif to his presence, the latter would immediately obey the summons,  —at least such appear to have been the prerogatives annexed to that office during  the reign of the Beni Umeyyah, and such of the sovereigns of the petty dynasties as  followed their system of government. The title of Kadi ought in strictness to be  applied to those only who exercised the functions of judges in a city or large town ;  if the place was small he was called Hékim. The Kédi-l-kodé (or chief Kédf) was  also called Kddiu-l-jamd@’h.   The office of the Sdhibu-sh-shartah ® was the same as it is in our days, and its  functions nearly similar to those now attached to that post in Africa. The vulgar  called him Sdhibu-l-medinah (city magistrate), and Sdhibu-l-leyl (night magistrate).  The functions of this office were at one time of a most formidable description, for  if he were at all in favour with the Sultén, and had his confidence, he could sentence  to death any one he pleased, and have the sentence executed without any previous  leave from the sovereign. However, this appears to have been but of rare oc-  currence ; neither was the appointment much used, being only to be met with in  great capitals, and at the court of the Sultan. Abi Zeyd Ibn Khaldin treats at  length of the functions of this officer,°' which seem to have consisted in the detection  and punishment of crimes against morality—such as adultery, the drinking of in-  toxicating liquors, and so forth. Other civil offences fell also under his jurisdiction.  In former times, however, this office could not exist without the express consent     CHAP. VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 105    of the Kadi, by whose sufferance only it continued, and whose authority was much  more respected, at the same time that it stood on more legal grounds.   The office of the Mohtesib®? was generally conferred in Andalus on men of Mohtesib.  probity, experience, and learning, and who belonged to the class of the Kadis.  The duties of this officer consisted in riding, early in the morning, through the  market, followed by his guards, one of whom carried a pair of scales in his hand,  to weigh the bread ; for in Andalus the weight and price of bread was at all times  fixed by the authorities ; so, for instance, a loaf of a certain weight would sell for  the fourth of a dirhem, and another of half its size for the eighth of a dirhem.  These measures, moreover, produced so good an effect, that whoever wanted  provisions for his daily consumption might send to market a little boy or a  simple girl, with directions to buy whatever he wanted, and yet be perfectly  satisfied that no imposition was practised upon him, and that every article had  its proper weight. The sale of meat was likewise subjected to the same rule,  it being enjoined to every butcher to have over his stall a label, with an inscription  marking the price fixed by the authorities of the town. So neither bakers nor  butchers dared to sell their articles for a higher price, nor cheat in the weight ; for  were the Mohtesib to entertain the least suspicion about one of them, he would  soon put him to the test by sending a boy or girl to buy some bread or meat from  him, and if, when weighed, it was found to be in the least deficient, he would  punish the infractor, and fine him heavily ; this for the first time, for if he were to  be found in fault again, the magistrate would sentence him to be publicly flogged,  and exposed in the market-place for the salutary warning of all the rest of the  dealers, after which he would banish him the city. The office of the Mohtesib was  further made to extend to all articles of sale, and those who filled it had to learn  certain practices or rules before being fit to obtain it; in the same manner as a  Faquih would among us study the decisions of the law before he would be con-  sidered fit to fill the situation of a Kédi.*   As to the night-watch, whom we call in the West Tawdfu-I-leyl, and who in the Ad-dirabin, or  East are called As‘hab-arbd’,* they were generally designated in Andalus under the neues  name of Ad-ddrabin (gate-keepers), on account of certain interior gates which most  of the cities in that country had, and which it was the duty of those guards to shut  every evening after the prayer of ’atemah, thereby preventing any communication  between the various quarters of the city during the night. Every one of these  gates had its watchman, who, besides being well armed, was provided with a dark  lantern, and had with him a dog to warn him by his bark if any noise was heard.  “ All these precautions,” adds Ibnu Sa’id, ‘are indispensable in the large cities  “of Andalus, owing to the great number of thieves and vagabonds who either   VOL. 1. P     106 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book I.    “* disturb the public tranquillity at night by their brawls and clamours, or commit  ‘the most daring robberies; for it is by no means an uncommon thing in our  “* times to hear of a gang of robbers assembling at night, attacking a strong house,  ‘* penetrating into it, plundering it of whatever property they find, and murdering  “all its inmates for fear they should offer any resistance, or assist the next day.in  ‘“‘ their discovery and apprehension. It is therefore a thing of frequent occurrence  ‘in Andalus to hear people say,—‘ Last night robbers broke into the house of such  “a one, or such a one was found murdered in his bed.’”’ It is true, observes our  author, that crimes of this kind are not equally common all over Andalus, and  are generally confined to large cities, and, even there, they are more or less frequent  according to the severity or indifference shown by the authorities; but in general  it must be owned that although the greatest rigour has been at times employed  against robbers, so much as to inflict capital punishment for stealing a bunch of  grapes out of a vineyard, and that the sword of justice has dropped with their  blood, Andalus has never been quite free from that scourge. A very entertaining  anecdote is told of a famous highwayman, called Al-bdziyu-l-ash’ab (the Grey-hawk),  who lived in the time of Al-mu’atamed, King of Seville. He was renowned for his °  dexterity and courage, and soon became the scourge of the country; for at the  head of a small band of chosen followers he began to scour the fields, surprising  the inhabitants in their farms and villages, and depriving them of their valuables.  Long did he baffle the search of justice, and escape from every troop sent for his  apprehension ; but, at last, he fell one day into the hands of the king’s officers, and  the event being reported to Al-mu’atamed, he was sentenced to be crucified by the  side of a much-frequented path, in the midst of the very district which had been the  principal theatre of his depredations. The sentence having been duly carried into  execution, the poor man was hanging miserably stretched on the cross, when, behold !  his wife and daughters came up, and began to sob and wail around him, exclaiming,  in the midst of their tears, “Our doom is signed, and our deaths are certain ; who  “« shall provide for us when thou art no more?” They were thus lamenting over  their misfortune when a peasant happened to pass by, riding on a mule, and having  before him something like a large bundle of clothes or goods.—‘‘ Friend,” said the  robber on the cross to the passenger, “take pity on me, and, since thou seest me  ‘in this condition, grant me a last favour, which will prove beneficial to thee too.”  “ And what is it, pray?” said the peasant. ‘Go to yonder well,” replied the  robber, ‘‘ and thou shalt find at the bottom one hundred dindrs in a purse, which,  “as I was closely pursued by the constables, I threw therein ; if thou succeed in  “‘ getting them out, half shall be thy reward; the remaining half thou must  “ give to my wife and daughters here, that they may support themselves for a     CHAP.

Go, hasten to the spot, and do not be afraid ; my wife will  “« assist thee in thy descent by holding a rope, and my daughters will take care  “‘ of thy mule.” The peasant consented, upon the offered conditions, and bent his  steps towards the well; there he tied a rope round his waist, ‘and, assisted by the  woman, began to let himself down, but no sooner had he reached the bottom than  the robber’s wife cut the rope, and the poor wretch was left in the water struggling  and screaming, while his deceiver, as may easily be imagined, hastened to the spot  where his mule was, seized on whatever property he carried, and quickly dis-  appeared with her daughters. The poor man, in the meanwhile, finding the depth of  the well, and that he had not the means of getting out, began to cry out as loud as  he could, in hopes of calling the attention of some passenger ; and the hollow of the  well rang with his cries of ‘‘help! help!” It was summer time, and the weather  very hot, so that many travellers approached the well to draw water for themselves  and their beasts; but the moment one of them came near to it, and heard the voice  of the poor peasant inside, he ran away from it in great fright and consternation,  not knowing what caused the pitiful lamentations and wailings that issued from the  water. For many a long hour did the unhappy man remain in this miserable  plight, until some of the passengers having acquainted each other with the circum-  stance, they came to the resolution of returning to the spot, and ascertaining the  cause of the strange noises they had heard. Hastening back to the well, they  soon discovered the peasant lying at the bottom of it, who, by means of a rope  thrown him, was speedily extricated from the dangerous situation in which he lay.  Being asked how he had come by his misfortune, he told them that he had been  deceived, and pointing to the highwayman on the cross, ‘‘ Yonder knave,”’ said he,  “* was the cause of it, in order to give his wife and daughters an opportunity to  “ plunder me.” However, the adventure soon became known in Seville, whither the  peasant directed his course, and being reported to A]-mu’atamed, he was surprised  to hear of the robber’s cunning and impudence; and wishing to see him, and  interrogate him on the subject, he commanded that Grey-hawk should be made  to appear in his presence. Agreeably to his orders, the robber was let down from  the cross, and brought before the King, who addressed him thus: ‘‘ Tell me, O  “ Grey-hawk ! how couldst thou be guilty of such a crime as that now imputed to  “thee, and that too, being, as it were, under the clutch of death?” ‘“O King!”  replied the robber, “ if thou knewest how strongly nature impels me to the  ‘* perpetration of such acts, and how great is the pleasure I enjoy while I commit  “them, Ihave no doubt but that thou wouldst relinquish the royal power, and  “‘ embrace my profession.” Al-mu’atamed could not help smiling when he heard  this; he then said, after some time, ‘‘ O Grey-hawk! were I to set thee at liberty,     108 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    “ and treat thee kindly,—were I to act generously towards thee, and allow thee a  “ pension for thy maintenance and that of thy family,—tell me, wouldst thou repent  “of thy misdeeds, and forsake thy criminal practices?” ‘If repentance,” said  Grey-hawk, “‘ is to be my only way to salvation, I do not hesitate to accept life under  ‘* such conditions.” Upon which, Al-mu’atamed, having previously made him swear  to keep his engagement, liberated him, and gave him the command of a resolute  band for the prosecution and detection of thieves in a particular quarter of the city.  But to return.   These appear to have been the principal offices during the reign of the Beni  Umeyyah and those of the petty sovereigns who usurped the power after them;  there are still some civil as well as military appointments which we have  passed in silence for brevity’s sake, such as the Wali, or governor of a  province, the Kdyidu-l-asdtil (admiral of the fleet*), and others. In general,  the Sulténs of the house of Merwdn were distinguished for their care in  naming to these offices the individuals most fit for their several duties, as  also for having vied with each other in distinguishing and honouring the  learned, raising them in rank or command, and admitting them to their  privacy and favour: they were never known to appoint an undeserving Wizir  nor a Kadi, nor to grant a seat in their council-room but to those who  had given ample proofs of sagacity and learning. They always showed the  greatest respect for the opinions of the learned, as is well known in the case  of Al-hakem, who, persuaded by some strict theologians who were averse to  wine, commanded that all the vines in his dominions should be rooted up,  although, on the suggestion of some of his favourites, who represented to him  that he could not prevent wine being made in other countries, and intro-  duced into Andalus, he relaxed in severity, and the order was never carried  into execution.*® They never appointed any to the charge of Mufti, or to the  examination of witnesses, but men of great learning and experience, and well  read in the Koran, and in the decisions of the law. They were also to be rich,  or at least to be possessed of a decent income, lest their poverty should induce  them to covet the property of others, and sell justice to the pleaders. Ash-  shakandi, from whom the foregoing details are borrowed, relates an anecdote  which we shall transcribe here, as illustrative of what we have advanced. ‘“ Al-  “‘hakem, surnamed Ar-rabadht*’ (he of the suburb), wishing once to appoint  “one of the most distinguished theologians of Cordova to the special charge of  “« receiving the declarations of witnesses, consulted with Yahya Ibn Yahya,** ’Abdu-  ‘* |-mdlik,®® and other doctors, upon the propriety of his nomination, and asked  “‘ them to give him their opinion on the person of his choice. The doctors then     CHAP. VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 109    “ said in reply,—‘ O Prince of the believers! the individual thou hast chosen is  “no doubt an able and very worthy man, but he is exceedingly poor, and  ‘whoever has not an independent fortune to live upon ought by no means to  “be imtrusted with the decisions of the law, and be made the judge between  ‘the Moslems ; especially if thou wishest him to derive utility and profit from  ‘his office, and yet to be just and impartial in his judgments when he has  “to decide between the executors*® of a will and the heirs appointed in it.’  “On hearing this Al-hakem kept silence, and did not seem inclined to accept of  “their remonstrances ; on the contrary, he appeared to be angry and disappointed  “at seeing the doctors oppose his will. The counsellors then left the room, and  “ Al-hakem remained thoughtful, until his son ’Abdu-r-rahmdén, who succeeded  “him in the empire, happening to come in, and seeing sorrow and anger on his  “countenance, inquired the cause of it. ‘ What ails thee, O father! who has  “displeased thee ?? ‘ Hast thou not seen,’ said Al-hakem, ‘ those whom I  “extolled and raised above all others, and whom I have distinguished so far as  “to consult them on matters which neither concerned them, nor affected them  “in the least, wishing us to turn our faces from our intention, and shutting  “upon us the gates of intercession ?’—and then he told his son what had  “occurred. ‘O, father!’ replied ’Abdu-r-rahmdn, ‘thou art the dispenser of  “ justice, and thy uprightness exceeds that of any other Sultan on the earth ;  “in appointing and distinguishing the men of whom thou now complainest,  “thy object was, no doubt, not to raise and extol them, but to honour science  “through their means; so I see no remedy for it unless thou removest them  “from their situations, and take away their dignities and honours to confer  ‘them on ignorant people.’ ‘ Certainly not,’ said Al-hakem, ‘that I will  “never do.’ ‘ Well, then,’ continued his son, ‘ be just with them, and since  “science and virtue have no other language, leave them im their offices, that  “they may enjoy the pleasures of this world, and afterwards participate in the  “blessings of the other.’ ‘Thou art right, son!’ interrupted Al-hakem. ‘ As  “to the objection raised by them,’ continued ’Abdu-r-rahman, ‘ respecting  “the scantiness of his means, and his liability to be corrupted, the remedy rests  ‘in thy hands, and thou mayest stop their mouths by a single act of thy wonted  “ generosity.’ ‘ And what is that?’ replied Al-hakem. ‘ Give to thy protégé,’  “ answered ’Abdu-r-rahmén, ‘ from thy treasury, a sufficient sum to enable him to  “ fill his station with honour ; this will remove all the scruples of thy advisers,  “and will, besides being an action in which none of thy predecessors surpassed  “thee, raise thee highly in the estimation of thy subjects.’ ‘ Well said,’ ex-  “claimed Al-hakem, his countenance suddenly brightening with joy and satis-     Taxes.    110 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK 1.    “* faction ; ‘ come to me, I see that generosity is natural to thee; and that the  “ poet was right who said—  ‘The sons of kings are generous and magnificent lords; the smallest  ‘among them is greater than the greatest of his subjects.’   “ After this, Al-hakem ordered ’Abdu-l-m4lik Ibn Habib into his presence,  ‘“and asked him how much he thought would be sufficient for the support of a  “ functionary in that situation; and when the sum was fixed by ’Abdu-1-mélik,  “the Khalif issued an order on his treasury for the amount; and not only was  “the allowance paid regularly out of the royal coffers as long as the judge  “ lived, but he himself rose high in the estimation and favour of his sovereign,  “‘who gave him a horse out of his own stables, and conferred on him all sorts  “of honours and distinctions. And this was certainly a noble and generous  “ action, the merits of which cannot be concealed, nor its memory be obliterated  “by time. Thus provided with means sufficient to resist the temptations of  “bribery, and having sufficient piety and virtue to avoid the committing of  “acts offensive to God, and the requisite learning to guide him through the  “‘maze of legal decisions, and to inspire him with equitable sentences in all  “ trials and judgments, the new functionary fulfilled his duties in the most steady  “and upright manner, and his legal decisions became so many oracles among  “those of his profession.”   In the first years of the conquest the Moslems of Andalus were subject to  the payment of those legal taxes designated in the Sunnah, and which every  Moslem is bound to contribute. This, joined to certain customs paid by the  Jews and Christians, was more than sufficient to meet the expenses of the court  and carry on the government, but in latter times the splendour assumed by  the Sulténs of the family of Merw4n, their prodigality towards the learned, and  the numerous armies they were obliged to keep constantly on foot, made it  necessary for them to impose new tributes on their Moslem subjects, although  every exaction of the kind is expressly forbidden by the text of the law. The  amount of taxes thus collected in the time of the Sultans of the house of Umeyyah  has been differently estimated by various writers. The geographer Ibnu Haukal  says that under ’Abdu-r-rahmdén I. they amounted only to 300,000 dinars, a  sum which was collected from the principal cities according to their trade and  the wealth of their inhabitants, each contributing a fixed quota towards the making  up of the total sum. The contributions thus levied were divided into three equal  portions : one-third was spent in the maintenance of the army ; another went to  pay the salaries of civil officers and judges, and to defray all the expenses of  the administration ; while the remainder was deposited in the coffers of the Khalif     CHAP. VIII.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. . 111    to meet cases of emergency, sudden invasions of the enemy, and so forth. But,  in our opinion, this statement is not correct; Ibnu Haukal can only speak of  the legal tax called zakah,** and not of all the other contributions, or else they  were enormously increased under the reign of his successors, for we are told that  under ’Abdu-r-rahmdén al-ausatt*® the sums levied amounted to one million of  dinars every year, and that under his father’s administration they were computed  at seven hundred thousand, which makes more than double the sum stated by  that geographer. Moreover, the revenues of Andalus must have increased in a  still greater proportion under his grandson ’Abdu-r-rahman III., since, in the  words of Ibn Khallekén, Ibnu Bashkiwél, and other historians, they are said to  have amounted to five millions four hundred and eighty thousand din4rs,“ without  including in that sum either the duties raised on all articles of sale, or the con-,  tribution called al-mostkhaldss,““ which amounted to seven hundred and sixty-five  thousand dinars. But of this more will be said when we come to the reign of  *Abdu-r-rahman An-nassir.",book_1,chapter_8

Ir now behoves us to say something on the manners and customs of the inhabitants  of Andalus ; their piety, their aptitude for the sciences, their courage, their gene-  rosity, their wit, and a thousand eminent qualities by which they have become  famous among the nations. We shall begin with their attachment to the internal  dogmas as well as the exterior practices of religion. This may be said, in a certain  measure, to have been more or less strong according to time and circumstances,  and to have been determined by the religious habits and the conduct of the head of  the state himself. However, it must be owned that, with a few exceptions, the  precepts of religion were always held in the greatest awe and veneration, and all  innovations or heretical practices abhorred and looked upon with contempt.  Indeed, the disapprobation of the people in matters of this kind was so strong,  that we are told by the historians of the time that it would have been a dangerous  thing for any theologian, whatever might have been his birth or authority, to show  the least deviation from the true spirit of religion; and that had a favourite or a  relation of the Khalif been guilty of any heretical practice, and had the Sultan  countenanced him in it, or not shown in some way his censure, the mob would  have soon penetrated into his strong palace, and, in spite of his body-guard, seized  on their victim, torn him to pieces, or expelled him from the city. This was of  frequent occurrence during the reign of the Beni Umeyyah, as also the pelting  of judges and governors whenever the inhabitants thought that proper justice  was not given to them in their trials, or that they were despotically treated by  their rulers.   In former times the Andalusians, like the inhabitants of Syria, followed the     CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 113    sect of Al-auzd’ei,' but during the reign of Al-hakem, son of Hishdm, son of  *Abdu-r-rahmdn Ad-dakhel, the third Sultan of the family of Merwadn in Andalus,  some learned doctors began to utter legal decisions in conformity with the opinions  of Malik Ibn Ans and the people of Medina, whose doctrines soon became known  and spread all over Andalus and Africa; the change being in a great measure  brought on by Al-hakem’s conviction and firmness. There are various opinions  entertained as to the reasons which induced the Sultan to make that innovation;  the most current being that several Andalusian doctors happening to go to Medina,  and having become acquainted with the Im4m Malik, then residing in that city,  and having heard from his own mouth the exposition of his sublime doctrines,  were deeply impressed with their truth, and on their return to Andalus began to  spread and preach them every where, expatiating in praise of their master, boasting  of his virtues, his influence, his wide-spread fame, and the high estimation in  which he was held by all classes of the people. This having reached the ears of  Al-hakem, he held several conferences with them, and the result was that, being  convinced of the purity and advantages of their doctrines, he issued immediate  orders for the establishment of the sect of Mélik Ibn Ans throughout his do-  minions. : ;   Others assert that the Imam Malik having once interrogated an Andalusian  doctor, whom he happened to meet at Medina, as to the habits and mode of  life of the sovereigns of the house of Merwdn, was very much surprised and  gratified to hear that Al-hakem led a most exemplary and irreproachable life,  offering a contrast to the conduct of the ’Abbasside Khalifs, and especially of Abi  Ja’far Al-mansir, who, as is well known and may be read in the history of the  time, was then persecuting the descendants and partisans of ’Ali, casting them into  prison, and subjecting them to all manner of ill treatment, for which reason  Malik never failed to censure his proceedings: hearing, therefore, of the praise-  worthy conduct of Al-hakem Ibn Hishdém, he is said to have exclaimed in rapture,  ‘God grant that he may be one of ours,” or words to that purport.? This wish  having been communicated to the Sultén by the doctor in whose presence it was  expressed, they say that Al-hakem, who was already informed of the great repu-  tation which his virtues and sanctity had gained him, decided immediately upon  adopting the sect of Mélik and forsaking that of Al-auzé’ei. Among the Anda-  lusian doctors who contributed most efficaciously to bring about this change, either  by their words or by their writings, are counted ’Abdu-l-mdlik Ibn Habib, Yahya  Tbn Yahya Al-leythi, and Zey4d Al-lakhmi; but of this more will be said  hereafter.®   We find that in Andalus, as in the East, faquirs might be found in great   VOL. I. Q    Sect of Malik  Tbn Ans.    When intro-  duced.    Faquirs.     114 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    numbers ; they wore their general dress called darwdzah,* but so tattered and torn  that it almost fell to pieces. There, as in the East, they were well acquainted with all  the arts and tricks of their profession, and knew how to give the face the appearance  of extreme hunger, in order to beg in the streets and market-places ; indeed their  filthiness and impudence seem to have been beyond description. However, we are  inclined to believe that they never were so numerous as in the East, nor did they  obtain in Andalus the same success which they had there, for Ibnu Sa’id tells us  that it was a general rule among his countrymen not to encourage idleness by  bestowing alms on people capable of gaining their livelihood by labour, and that if  an Andalusian happened to meet a strong and healthy man under such a disguise, he  would, instead of giving him alms, abuse him, and, by denouncing him to the  magistrates, have him cast into prison ; this is the reason why beggars were at all  times scarce in Andalus,—those, however, always excepted, who, through some  corporeal defect, could not earn their living. However, the judgment that we  have passed on the faquirs of Andalus must be applied to the generality, not to all,  for there were among them men who, moved by sentiments of piety and devotion,  left the world and its vanities, and either retired to convents to pass the remainder  of their lives among brethren of the same community, or, putting on the darwdzah  and grasping the staff of the faquir, went through the country begging a scanty  pittance, and moving the faithful to compassion by their wretched and revolting  appearance. The following anecdote, which we extract from the celebrated work by  Ar-ré’ii, entitled ‘‘the book of luminous introduction to the knowledge of those  ‘ qualities which a faquir ought to have,’’® will convey some idea of their customs  and habits. ‘‘ It happened once,” says that author, ‘“ that the Sherif Abd-l-ma’Ali,  “son of Abi-l-k4sim Al-hiseyn, Kédi-l-kod4 of Granada,® and commentator of  “ the Al-khazrajlyeh, and the Makssirah’ of Hazem, a man not only illustrious by  “his birth,—for both his father and mother were descendants of Hasan, and  ‘* consequently of the family of the Prophet,—but by his virtues and eminent  “ qualities, renounced at once all his dignities and employments, and gave himself  “up entirely to devotion and abstinence. Being a man of profound learning and  “* great piety, of amiable disposition and courteous manners, he won the esteem of  “« every one of his fellow-citizens, and became the object towards which the fingers of  ‘the people of this world and of the world to come were universally pointing. He  “« had a brother whose name was Abi-l-’abbés Ahmed, K4di of a town in the eastern  “ districts of Andalus, but who was then residing in Granada; with him Abi-l-  “‘ ma’4li dwelt, but he would never eat any thing in his house because he was in  “the employment of the Sultan: he would, whenever he felt hungry, go to his  “« brother, and say to him, ‘ Brother, I am hungry, give me a dirhem that I may buy     CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 115    “ food,’ and he used to go to market, and procure such provisions as he most  “wanted. In this way he lived for several years, persevering in his resolution,  “and depriving himself of every one of the comforts which the world bestows,  “ until one day he bent his steps towards a convent in the outskirts of Granada,  “called Zdwiyatu-l-mahrik (the convent of the burnt),® and addressing himself  “to its inmates, whose superior at the time was Abi Ja’far Ahmed Al-mahdiid, he  “* said to them, ‘ My friends! I had a lamp to light myself with, and I have lost it,  “so that I cannot see at all;’ and the superior replied to him, ‘O Sherif! I cannot  “answer thee, but the first man who happens to come here shall do it to thy  “* gatisfaction.” Few minutes had elapsed before one of the many holy men who  “‘ used to visit the convent made his appearance, and sat himself by the side of  “ Abi Ja’far, who addressed him thus,—' Brother, this Sherif has just now put a  “‘ question to our community, and I have told him that the first man who should  “enter here would answer it for him; so hear what he has got to say, and reply  “to him.’ Abi-l-ma’éli then repeated his words,—‘ I had a lamp to light myself  “with, and I have lost it, so that I cannot see at all:’ the stranger then said,  “* Well, that only shows a breach of discipline, thou must tell me more:’ then  “ Abé-l-ma’4li said, ‘I do not remember any fault I have committed, unless it be  “that when so and so incurred the displeasure of the Sultan, and concealed himself  “ for fear of the approaching chastisement, I passed one day by his house, and he  “ called me through the wicket of his door, and begged me to pray to God in his  “ behalf, and I said to him—repeat such and such a prayer,—meaning one which  “* contains all the illustrious names of the Almighty God, and which is well known  “to be an efficacious remedy against all calamities present and to come; a prayer  “ which is recorded by Al-biini in his Al-muntekhab,® and has repeatedly produced  “the most miraculous effects, and was communicated to me by my brother Ahmed  “ Ash-sherif, who had it from one of his disciples.’ When the faquir heard this,  “ he said, ‘ And when this took place hadst thou permission to admonish him ?’  “© No,’ answered Abii-l-ma’éli. ‘Well then,’ said the faquir, ‘it is of no use  “asking for thy lamp, thou shalt never recover it, and the light shall never be  “ restored to thee, for thou hast committed a breach of the rules which every  “faquir ought to observe.’ And so it happened; for some time after this  “ Abi-l-ma’4li returned to the world, and, putting an end to his austerity and  ‘ abstinence, accepted the office of Kdédi which was offered to him, and served  “ kings, ate at their tables, and accepted their presents. This anecdote is well  “known all over Granada, as well as Abi-l-ma’éli’s apostacy.

They have left off the turban, especially  ‘in the eastern provinces; in the western, however, it is still used by people  “of rank and wealth, or those holding situations under government.{ Thou wilt  “never see in Cordova or in Seville a K4di or a Faquih without his turban; in  ‘* Valencia, Murcia, and other provinces of the east of Spain, on the contrary, it is  ‘* quite common to see men of the highest rank walk about the streets with bare  ‘heads; as to the lower classes, they never use the turban. I recollect once  “seeing in Murcia one of the most distinguished and respected Ulemas of the city  “ appear before the Sultén who then reigned in those districts; he wore nothing  “on his head, and his white hair, shining bright among his black locks, had the  “* most ludicrous appearance. Military officers, soldiers, and men of the inferior  “classes, have likewise left it off, even in the western provinces. Ibn Hid,”  “formerly King of Saragossa, and who in our days reduced to obedience the  “greatest part of Andalus, never used a turban; I accompanied him in most  ‘of his military expeditions, and always saw him without it. I might say the  “same of Ibnu-l-ahmar, who is the present ruler of this country.   “* The cloak called taylasdn™ is used by all classes of the people, men of rank  ‘as well as plebeians, so that thou wilt never see an Andalusian go out into the  ‘ street without having his cloak on, the only difference being that Sheikhs and  “‘ other people of distinction throw their hood over their heads, whilst common  “ people never do so. Woollen caps are generally used as a substitute for turbans ;  ‘« the colours most worn are either red or green; yellow is reserved for the Jews,  “‘ who, on no occasion, are allowed to use any other. The hair is cut short, only  “ Kaédis and Ulemas wear it long; but instead of letting it hang over their  ‘shoulders, as is the fashion in the East, they wear it loose underneath the  “* left ear. ;   “Even the people who use turbans follow a fashion of their own, and seem  ‘entirely to disregard the multifarious shapes used by people of rank and dis-  “ tinction in other Moslem states ; so if an eastern Arab happens to come among  “ them, wearing a turban in the Syrian or Hejazi fashion,—and large high things  “they are, looking like towers,—they will show great astonishment, and appear  “much struck with the novelty; but instead of admiring its shape and structure,  * they will burst out laughing, and jest at the expense of the wearer, for in general  “the Andalusians are very slow in adopting the fashions of other nations, and  “‘ neither admire nor like any thing but their own. They are also the cleanest  “people on earth in what regards their person, dress, beds, and in the interior  “ of their houses ; indeed, they carry cleanliness to such an extreme that it is not     cHaP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 117    “an uncommon thing for a man of the lower classes to spend his last dirhem in  “soap instead of buying food for his daily consumption, and thus go without  “his dinner rather than appear in public with dirty clothes.   Sultans, military officers, and even the common soldiers, followed the fashions Hates  of the infidels; in time of war, especially, they wore a dress very similar to in time of war.  that of the Christians, their neighbours. They used likewise the same weapons,  and, like them, were clad in mail, over which they threw a short scarlet tunic,  in the Christian fashion. They fought on horseback with shield and spear,  but knew not how to use either the mace or the bow of the Arabs; instead of  which they adopted the cross-bow of the Franks, and used it in sieges, or in  marches, to defend the infantry from the attacks of cavalry, for without that  requisite they would certainly be defeated. However, we are informed by Ibnu-  l-khattib that under the Merinite Sulténs, who reigned at Granada, the Anda-  lusian troops were again clad and armed in the real Arabic fashion; instead  of the heavy steel helmet and thick breast-plate of their ancestors, they then  wore a slender head-piece, and a thin but well-tempered cuirass; instead of  the huge spear with a broad end in the Christian fashion, they took the long  and slender reed of the Arabs, and they substituted for the clumsy and ill-shaped  Christian saddle the more military-looking and more convenient horse furniture  of the inhabitants of Arabia.'?   The character of the Andalusian Arabs has been thus described by Ibnu Ghélib To eminent  in his Kitdb > forjati-l-anfus (the book of contentment of the soul), a work to’ anes  which we have more than once referred in the course of our narrative. ‘‘ The  “ Andalusians,” sseye<he; “ are Arabs by descent, in pride, in the haughtiness of  “their temper, the elevation of their minds, the goodness of their heart, and  “the purity of their intentions; they resemble them in their abhorrence of every  “thing that is cruel or oppressive, in their inability to endure subjection or  “contempt, and in the liberal expenditure of whatever they possess. They are  “Indians in their love of learning, as well as in their assiduous cultivation of  “ science, their firm adherence to its principles, and the scrupulous attention  “with which they transmit down to their posterity its invaluable secrets. They  “are like the people of Baghddd in cleanliness of person and beauty of form,  ‘Celegance of manners, in mildness of disposition, subtilty of mind, power of  “thought, extent of memory, and universality of talent. They are Turks in  “ their aptitude for war, their deep acquaintance with every one of its stratagems,   “and their skilful preparation of the weapons and machines used in it, as well  “as their extreme care and foresight in all matters concerning it. They have  “been further compared with the Chinese (by an Andalusian author named     Their simila-  rity to the  Greeks.    Skill of their  workmen.    118 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN {Book 11.    “‘ Tbnu Hazm) for the delicacy of their work and the subtilty of their manufactures,  “and their dexterity in imitating all sorts of figures. And, lastly, it is generally  ** asserted that they are of all nations that which most resembles the Greeks  “* in their knowledge of the physical and natural sciences, their ability in discovering  “‘ waters hidden in the bowels of the earth, and bringing them to the surface ; their  ‘“‘ acquaintance with the various species of trees and plants, and their several  “ fruits, and their industry in the pruning and grafting of trees, the arrangement  “and distribution of gardens, the treatment of plants and flowers, and all and  “every one of the branches of agriculture: indeed, so great is their proficiency  “in this science that it has almost become proverbial, and some eminent  “‘ writers among them have composed works which are generally approved of  “and consulted in the East and in the West. Such is the treatise on agriculture  “by Ibn Bassdl,'S an Andalusian, which is in the hands of every farmer, and  “the merits of which have been sufficiently appreciated by all those who have  “* followed its valuable instructions. The Andalusians, moreover, are the most  “* patient of men, and the fittest to endure fatigue ; they are thereby well qualified  “for labour of every description ; they likewise show great inclination for war,  ‘* and have on all occasions proved to be active, brave, and intelligent soldiers}”’   Various authors have dwelt at large on the great similarity existing between  the Andalusian Moslems and the Greeks, but it is easily accounted for by the  circumstance that the Greeks for a long time inhabited Andalus, and the Moslems  became thereby the inheritors of all their knowledge in the sciences.   Tbnu Ghélib continues, ‘‘ We may enumerate among the eminent qualifications  ‘of the inhabitants of Andalus that of having been the inventors of the species  ** of verse called al-muwashahah, which has not only been approved of by Eastern  “ critics, but adopted and used by their poets, and made the theme of public  “ literary competitions. As to their poems in the common kinds of metre, and  “their works in prose, nobody who has read them will deny that they stand high  “in the scale of merit.   “The skill of their workmen in all kinds of handicraft has been sufficiently  “acknowledged by travellers from the East, and other Mohammedan countries,  ‘‘who have lived among them; many are the articles now manufactured in  “ Andalus which are in high repute, and form the staple of considerable trade  ‘with Moslems and Christians: Africa may be said to have derived its present  “wealth and importance, and its extent of commerce, from Andalusians settling  “in it. For when God Almighty was pleased to send down on their country  “the last disastrous civil war, thousands of its inhabitants of all classes and  “* professions sought a refuge on these’® shores, and spread over Maghrebu-l-aksdé     CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 119    “and Africa proper, settling wherever they found comfort or employment.  “Labourers and country people took to the same occupations which they had  “left in Andalus,—they formed intimacy with the inhabitants, assisted them in  “ their agricultural labours, discovered springs, and made them available for the  “irrigation of their fields, planted trees, introduced water-mills,® and other  “useful inventions ; and, in short, they taught the African farmers many things  “they had never heard of, and showed them the use of excellent practices  ‘“‘ whereof they were completely ignorant. Through their means the countries  “where they fixed their residence became at once prosperous and rich, and  “ the inhabitants saw their wealth increase rapidly, as well as their comforts and  “* enjoyments. ‘   “The inhabitants of cities being for the most part well educated people, and  “ being versed in all the branches of learning and polite literature, soon made  “themselves conspicuous and known at court, or in the chief towns where  “they settled. They filled posts of distinction in the state, and were appointed  “to the charges of Wizirs, Katibs, governors of provinces and districts, tax  “collectors, and other offices under government, so that there was no district  “in Africa wherein some of the principal authorities were not Andalusians.   ‘« But it was in the class of operatives and workmen in all sorts of handicrafts They teach the  “ that Africa derived the most advantage from the tides of emigration setting towards etic  “its shores. It is well known that before the arrival of the Andalusians many  “of the trades which are now in a flourishing state were hardly known in Africa,  “and that in activity and dexterity the emigrants ranked far above the native  “workmen. So, for instance, if they undertook the building of an edifice they  “ completed it in the shortest possible time, and finished every thing so beautifully,  “and with such a perfection of design, that they won the hearts and affections  “of their employers, and their reputation grew immense among the people ;  “these being notorious facts, which none but the ignorant or the ill-intentioned  “could deny.”   Such are Ibnu Ghdlib’s expressions, transcribed literally from Ibnu Sa’id’s work,  where they may be found, with other curious information on the subject. The latter  author himself, making as it were a comment on Ibnu Ghalib’s words, and recording  some of the good qualities which the Andalusians were known to possess, adds as  follows: ‘‘ God Almighty knows it is not my intention to flatter my countrymen,  “but mierely to state the truth, following those impartial writers who are neither  “ carried away by the love of their country, nor diverted from truth through envy  “or malevolence ; my motto shall be, ‘ the path of truth is the surest path to  “ follow.’'7_ Perhaps some of my readers, in perusing the account I have just     120 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    “ given, in the words of Ibnu Ghalib, of the revolution created by the Andalusian  ‘* emigration in the trade and agriculture of Africa, will say to themselves,—this  “‘ author was undoubtedly partial towards his countrymen, and he exaggerated  “their merits; but let them plunge into his book, let them weigh every one of  “his expressions, and compare his narrative with those of other writers, and they  _ will soon feel convinced that he spoke the truth, and they will, if necessary,  ‘“‘ quote his words without fear.  ‘When they directed their looks towards Leylah, and saw the beauty of  ‘her face, they were confirmed in their belief, and  ‘ They exclaimed, We have still fallen short in our praises of thee.’ !®   “‘ T cannot deny,” continues Ibnu Sa’id, ‘‘ for the sake of truth and justice, that  “ Morocco is the Baghdad of the West; it is the largest city on this coast, as  “ likewise that which abounds most in public works, splendid buildings, palaces, and  “gardens. Yet it is a known fact that the capital of Al-maghreb was never so  “ flourishing as under the reign of the Beni ’Abdi-l-mimen, who took thither  ‘* workmen and operatives from all parts of their Andalusian dominions. This is  “‘ notorious, and needs no confirmation: the same might be said of the city of  “ Tunis, in Africa proper, to which in my times the prosperity and splendour of  ““ Morocco may be said to have migrated, owing to the present Sultan, Abi  “« Zakariyya Yahya Ibn Abi Mohammed Ibn Abi Hafs,’® having fixed his court  “in it. This prince has erected buildings, constructed palaces, and planted  “‘ gardens and vineyards in the Andalusian fashion: all his architects are natives  “« of this country, as likewise most of his masons, carpenters, bricklayers, painters,  ‘“‘ and gardeners. The plans were either designed by Andalusians or copied from  “ buildings in their country ; and although the Sultan himself is a very good judge  “in these matters, and has an exquisite taste, yet it is well knot that the  “‘ mosques, palaces, and gardens erected by him, and so much admired by the  *« Africans, are mere copies of similar buildings in our country. So, as far as   “ this goes, it is clearly demonstrated that Ibnu Ghdlib told the truth.”",book_2,chapter_1
"    CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 121    CHAPTER II.    Character of the Andalusians—Their hospitality—Their courage in battle—Their haughtiness of  temper—Devotion to their friends—Their justice—Forgiveness—Generosity.    Tue qualities of the Andalusians are as brilliant and manifest as the beauties of Character of  the country they inhabit are shining and conspicuous. The same author that sians.  we have mentioned elsewhere (Ibnu Ghalib) affirms, on the authority of Ptolemy,  that, owing to the influence exercised by the planet Venus, the people of Andalus  are endowed with a lively imagination, elegance of manners, exquisite taste in  food, clothing, and whatever concerns their persons, cleanliness, and love of  pleasure and music. Mercury imparts to them inclination to economy and’  orderly habits, ardour in the acquisition of learning, love of philosophy and the  natural sciences, justice and impartiality in their judgments.   Tbnu Ghalib goes on detailing the qualities which are assigned to the Andalusians  on account of the influence exercised over them by Vulcan, Saturn, and Jupiter ;  but in this the author was wrong, since it is well known that only the fourth  and fifth climates pass over Andalus, the sixth passing close to its northern shores,  and the seventh by the islands of the Majis. The Sun is the planet of the fourth  climate, Venus of the fifth, Mercury of the sixth, and the Moon of the seventh ;  as to the second and third, they are in no way connected with Andalus.   We shall now enumerate some of their brilliant qualities, which we shall illustrate  by examples, that they may be more deeply impressed on the minds of our readers.  The Andalusians were justly renowned for their hospitality towards strangers, and Hospitality.  their histories abound in acts which rank them far above the other Moslems in  the exercise of that virtue. It is said of the Khalif ’Abdu-r-rahmdn III. that  on the arrival of Zary4b, the musician,’ at Cordova, he not only rode forth himself  to receive and welcome him, but entertained him for several months in his own  palace, and made him considerable presents; an action which is praiseworthy  enough in an equal, but which in a superior, and a Sultan so powerful and   VOL, 1. 2 R     122 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    dreaded as ’Abdu-r-rahmén, who was the first of his family to assume the titles  of Khalif and “ Prince of the faithful,” and whose court shone as bright as the  dazzling rays of the summer sun, surpasses all encomium.   The geographer Al-bekri, in his description of Africa, mentions another instance  of remarkable hospitality on the part of the same Sultén. Having heard that  Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah Ibn Abi ’Isa, Kéddt-l-jemd’h (or supreme judge) at Fez,  intended to cross over from Ceuta, the place of his residence, to Andalus, in  order to engage in some military expeditions against the Christians, he -ordered  that he should be written to in his name, pressing him to come, and apprising  him that he was not to lodge any where during his travels but in houses belonging  to the Sultén. Accordingly, between Algesiras, the place of his landing, and  Baldt Hamid,’ a place in the furthest frontier, where-the army was then encamping,  palaces were built by ’Abdu-r-rahmén’s orders, in which Mohammed was duly  received and lodged. The expenses of the erection of the palaces, thirty in number  (one for each day or station), being one thousand mithcals each.   “The Andalusians,” says Ibnu Sa’id, ‘‘ are both economical and orderly in  “ their habits; they are very careful of whatever property they possess, a circum-  ** stance which has induced some authors to stigmatize them as misers.   “Tn illustration of this I shall here relate an adventure which occurred to me  “‘ whilst in Andalus. I was once travelling with my father in one of the eastern  “ provinces when we were caught in a storm of rain and wind. It was then  “winter, and the cold was intense; the clouds poured down upon us more  “‘ water than the Nile itself has in its bed. Lightning crossed our sight, thunder  “ roared over our heads, we were wet through and perishing with cold, so that  “we determined upon directing our steps to a neighbouring village, and asking  ‘hospitality from the first inhabitant we should meet. It must be observed  “that both my father and I were at that time under the jealous vigilance* of  “the Sultén, and unprovided with sufficient means to take any other determi-  “nation. We therefore went to a house and knocked at the door; the owner,  ‘“‘a respectable old man, whom we had never seen before, soon opened it and  ‘admitted us into his house ; he received us with great kindness, and said soon  “ afterwards, ‘ If you have any money to give me I will buy charcoal and light  “a fire, that you may dry your clothes and warm yourselves; I will also go to  “market and get such provisions as you may want, and my people will dress  “them for you.’ We did what we were desired,—we gave him money to make  ‘‘ his purchases, and he soon came back and lighted a very good fire. While  ““we were warming ourselves at it, in came a young lad, apparently a son of  “our host, who, approaching the fire, began to warm himself, but no sooner     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 123    “did the father perceive it than he came up to his son, gave him a beating,  “and sent him away from it. ‘What dost thou beat this boy for?’ said my  “ father to our host. ‘I beat him,’ replied the old man, ‘that he may accustom  “himself from childhood to cold-and privation, and be thereby enabled: to earn  “his subsistence and provide for himself after I am dead.’ When it was time  “* to go to bed the old man said to the youth, ‘Give that thick cloak* of yours  “to this young man,’ pointing to me, ‘that he may add it to his covering and  ‘sleep more comfortably,’ and he did as desired. When I awoke in the morning  “I observed that the youth was also awake and holding in his hands one of  “the corners of his cloak. I afterwards communicated this observation to my  “father, who said to me, ‘Do not wonder at it, for this is a thing that happens  “every day, and it is in the character of the Andalusians to show the greatest  “ “ hospitality and benevolence towards their guests, at the same time that they   “use excessive precautions concerning their property. So, for instance, this man  “gave thee his cloak, in doing which he preferred thy comfort to his own, but,   “at the same time, seeing thee a stranger, and not knowing whether thou wert  “an honest man or a thief, prudence dictated to him not to go to sleep without  “ holding the cloak in his hand, lest thou shouldst run away with it in the  “ morning while he was asleep,—thus spoiling by his mean conduct all the merits  “of his generous action.’” The preceding anecdote is copied from Ibnu Sa’id  in his Al-mugh’rab.   The Andalusians have always been renowned for their intrepidity and courage, Courage.  and their history is full of acts of bravery and heroism scarcely to be equalled  by any other nation. It is related of the Amir Abt ’Abdillah Ibn Mardanish *  that whenever he’ came to close quarters with the infidels he used, regardless of  his life, to dash into the thickest of the mélee, where he performed such prodigies  of valour that his very enemies remained motionless with astonishment: on one  of these occasions, while he was charging the thick squadrons of the Christians,  and dispersing them like dust right and left, he was heard to exclaim—   “‘ When I plunge into the close ranks of the enemy, it matters not to me  ‘‘ whether I find my death in the midst of them or elsewhere.” ¢   On another occasion, having been attacked by superior forces, he required all  his courage and ability to extricate himself from his dangerous position. The  Christians closed on all sides upon him, but instead of losing courage he animated  his followers, and making a most desperate charge against the enemy, penetrated  into their ranks, unhorsed and killed their most valiant knights, and succeeded in‘  disengaging himself, after performing such feats of arms that he himself was  astonished. Then turning round to one of his favourite captains, an experienced     124 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK 11.    old warrior who had seen many a battle, and was well versed in all the chances of  war,—‘‘ What thinkest thou of all this?” said he. ‘‘ My opinion,” answered the  veteran, ‘‘ is, that had the Sultan witnessed the extraordinary feats of arms that  ‘thou hast just been performing, he would unquestionably have increased the  ‘* pension already allotted to thee from his treasury, and raised thee in honour and  ‘* command ; but on the other hand I doubt whether he would not have been angry  ‘* to see thee expose thy life in the manner thou hast done, for it becomes not the  “ general of an army to hazard his life more than is necessary, lest by so doing he  ‘should cause the destruction of his whole army.” ‘‘ Well, that may be so,”  replied Ibn Mardanish, ‘‘ but man dies not twice; and if I am killed, others may  ‘* save their lives by my death.” 7   Another famous warrior, whose name was the K4id Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Kadis,  is also much spoken of by the Andalusian historians. They say that he made  himself so conspicuous by his courage and his prowess against the enemy, as well as  by the forays he made into their territory, that his name was well known to the  meanest soldiers in the Christian camp, and that the single mention of it was  sufficient to cast terror into the heart of the stoutest knight. In confirmation  whereof an anecdote is told of a Christian warrior, who once approached a brook in  order to give his steed water ; when the animal pranced, reared, and would not  come near it. ‘‘ What ails thee?” said the soldier, addressing his horse, ‘ hast  thou seen Ibn Kadis in the water?”*® And this was no doubt a great distinction,  tending to prove the great estimation and awe in which the warrior was held by  the Christians, owing to the brilliant feats of arms he was seen to perform on  every occasion.   The same author from whom we have borrowed the preceding anecdote mentions  another very curious one, which he says he had from a trustworthy friend and eye-  witness. Ibn Kadts once left the frontiers of the Moslem dominions at the head  of a small but chosen band of resolute followers, in order to make a foray into  the enemy’s territory. However, he soon fell in with a considerable body of the  Christian troops, by which he was surrounded, and placed in imminent danger  of being made prisoner. But Ibn Kadtis being a brave and experienced warrior,  and knowing that he could rely on the courage and devotion of his handful of  men, instead of being frightened at the superior numbers of the enemy, rose in  his stirrups, said a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and, putting himself  at their head, plunged into the close ranks of the enemy, which he scattered and  dispersed right and left; thereby opening himself a passage, and disengaging his  small force without the loss of a single man. He then began to retire in good order  towards his camp, being closely followed by the Christians, but as he was retreating     CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 125    and fighting, one of his men who had remained considerably behind was unhorsed,  and his steed ran away. The soldier then implored the assistance of his captain,  who hastening back to him said—‘‘ Wait a moment, and defend thyself on foot  “till I get thee a horse ; ”—saying which, he rode to the nearest Christian horse-  man, threw him down at the very first onset, took his steed, and gave it to his  dismounted soldier, who was thereby enabled to join the main body. Many similar  feats of arms are recorded of this valiant captain. :   Hariz Ibn ’Okkéshah,® of the posterity of ""Okkéshah Ibn Mahiss, the com-  panion of the Prophet, is also counted among the bravest warriors that Andalus  ever produced. He was a man of colossal size and enormous strength, and few  were the warriors whom his arm reached in the heat of battle who ever escaped  with their lives. It once happened that Adfonsh’® (Alfonso), one of the infidel  kings of Andalus, at the head of considerable forces invaded the territories in which  Hariz commanded, and began, as was the custom in similar expeditions, to burn  the fields, to destroy the farm-houses, cut down the trees, and commit all sorts of  ravages. Wo sooner was Hariz acquainted with the invasion than he dispatched a  messenger to Alfonso, with a letter conceived in the following terms :—‘“‘ Desist  “from thy work of destruction, and spare misery and calamity to the creatures  “of the Almighty, for if it be decreed by Him that this country shall be thine,  “there is no need for thee to waste and destroy the land of thy future dominions ;  “ while, on the contrary, if it be written that thou shalt not conquer it, this country  “shall never be thine, even if thou hadst ten times the number of troops now  “under thy command.” On the receipt of this letter Alfonso ordered his host  to halt and abstain from further ravages ; he, moreover, feeling a great curiosity  to see a warrior of whom he had heard so much, sent him a messenger, requesting  him to come to his camp, and offering to give as hostages for the security of his  person a certain number of noblemen"" of his suite. Hariz consented, and the  necessary arrangements having been made, he set out for the camp of the Christian  monarch. On his arrival at Medinatu-I-baydhd,'* which is the same as Kal’at-Rabdh  (Calatrava), west of Toledo, Hariz rode through the streets of that city, and being  a very handsome man, of gigantic size, mounted on a powerful war-horse, and  completely cased in steel, the eyes of the people were fixed on him, for he was  really a beautiful sight to contemplate. The inhabitants of the places through  which he passed all came out to look at him, and gazed with astonishment at  the immense size of his body, the muscular strength of his limbs, the beauty and  polish of his armour and weapons, and his majestic and warlike demeanour ; they  moreover told each other tales of his martial exploits and invincible courage. On  his reaching the King’s tents, which were not far distant, all the principal noblemen     126 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK 11.    went out to meet him, welcomed and greeted him, and received him with the  greatest courtesy and distinction. When Hariz was about to dismount he planted  his spear in the earth so deeply and with so much force that the King, who was  present, felt fully convinced, by that act alone, of all the extent of his gallantry  and strength, while all the bystanders were seized with irrepressible fear, and  the countenances of his bravest knights appeared darkened with the terror which  they in vain tried to conceal. There happened to be near the camp a large  enclosure,* wherein the King and his knights exercised in manly sports; to this  spot Alfonso led Hariz, and invited him to take a part in the tournament for which  preparations had already been made, and which was on the point of beginning.  “No,” said Hariz, ‘the true knight never measures his sword but with those who  “* equal him in strength, and as I maintain that there is nobody among you capable  “ of drawing out this my spear which I have fixed in the ground, I shall not accept  “thy invitation; but if there be any one among you who believes he can do it,  “let him mount and try, and if he succeed I am ready to encounter him, one  “ or ten.” No sooner had Hariz uttered this challenge, than most of the knights  then present mounted their horses, and began to try their strength, but not one  amongst them succeeded in pulling out the spear fixed by Hariz; in vain did they  redouble their exertions and repeat the trial several times, the spear moved not an  inch from the spot where it had been planted by Hariz. Alfonso was not a little  astonished and grieved to see his knights so unsuccessful, but at last he was  compelled to say to Hariz, ‘‘ Thou art right, O warrior! let us see how thou dost  “‘it;” upon which, Hariz, leaping on his horse, galloped to the spot, and with  the slightest motion of his hand tore up his spear, the whole being done with the  greatest ease and elegance. All the bystanders remained dumb with admiration  when they saw the performance of Hariz, and the King himself bade him approach,  spoke to him graciously, and treated him with great regard and distinction.   This Hariz was likewise an excellent poet,.as may be gathered from the following  verses, which he wrote to the Kétib Abi-l-motref Ibnu-l-muthanna, secretary to  Tbnu Dhi-l-nin, King of Toledo. As Abv-l-motref was once travelling from  Cordova to Toledo, he happened to pass by the castle of Hariz,’* which stands on  the road between those two cities; Abi-l-motref lodged at a house outside the  walls, and soon after his arrival sent a message to Hariz, asking him for some  wine. The message was in verse, and thus conceived :   “O incomparable man! O phcenix of the age! O new moon among the  “ nobles !   “* Alas! wine is wanting, and has become as scarce as the ointment of the  “ balsam tree.” !®     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 127    And Hariz sent him down some, with the following answer, in the same metre  and rhyme :  “*O inestimable pearl ! O thou, the first among the illustrious men of past  ‘* times !  ‘« We have received thy verses resembling a garden refreshed by the gales  “* of eloquence,  “« And we send thee wine as sweet and well-flavoured as thy character and  “* disposition are mild.” *®  When Al-muktadir-billah Ibn Hiid, Sultd4n of Andalus, sallied from Saragossa to  the frontiers to oppose the son of Radmir, the great Christian king, who at the  head of considerable forces had invaded his territory, there happened to be in his  host a Moslem of the name of Sa’d4rah who performed a feat of arms well worthy  of record. Both armies, which were equally numerous and well appointed, met in  an extensive plain in the neighbourhood of Huesca; the battle was engaged with  great fury on both sides, and maintained with equal animosity during the whole  day, until towards evening the cavalry of the Moslems began to give way. When  Al-muktadir saw this, he ordered into his presence a borderer named Sa’ddrah, a  man of tried courage, and equally renowned for his exploits and his experience in  the affairs of war. ‘‘ What thinkest thou,” said Al-muktadir to Sa’ddrah, “ will  “ be the result of this day?” Sa’ddrah cast his experienced eye over the plain, and,  shaking his head, significantly answered, “To tell thee truth, O Prince! yonder  “signs bode no good ;” and pointing towards the dense iron-clad masses of the  Christian cavalry dispersing the light horsemen of Al-muktadir, he added, ‘‘ Unless  “yonder iron wall be broken by some unforeseen accident, the day will be against  “us.” “Thou art right,” replied Al-muktadir, “things look rather cloudy ;  “ but what dost thou propose to do?” Sa’ddérah meditated an instant, and said,  “ Among the white tents that cover the declivity of that hill I can easily perceive  “in the centre that of the son of Radmir towering above the rest ; if thou grant me  “ permission I will go there in disguise and kill the tyrant with my own hand.”  “ Well said,” replied Al-muktadir ; “ if thou succeed, the favours of thy master shall  “be lavished on thee; if thou fail, the rewards of the Almighty will be thy recom-  “pense.” Sa’dérah then goes to his tent, puts on a dress similar to those used  by Christian knights, arms himself with weapons like theirs, and, mounting his  steed, plunges into the thickest of the mélée. Being well acquainted with the  language and customs of the Christians, he had no difficulty, after opening himself  a passage through their thronged ranks, to penetrate into their camp. He then  goes to the King’s tent, and having entered it, he sees the son of Radmir sitting  upon a throne, completely cased in steel, so that the eyes were the only visible     -    128 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK I.    part of his body. He then watches for some time his opportunity, and, pouncing  upon the Christian, with a small dagger wounds him in the eye through one of the  apertures in the vizor, and kills him. He then leaves the tent, and begins to cry  out at the top of his voice, “‘ The King is killed! The King is killed!” '” and the  news spreading like fire through the enemy’s camp, panic and consternation seize  the Christian warriors ; they give way in every direction, and the victory remains in  the hands of the Moslems, who never ceased slaughtering until their arms were  tired, and their swords shivered from dealing blows.   The princes of the family of Hiid who reigned at Saragossa in the fifth century  of the Hijra being continually at war, not only with the Christians who surrounded  them on every side, but with their brethren among the Moslems during the long  and bloody civil wars which ravaged that country, had naturally numerous armies  in the best order and military discipline, and generals to command them, who, from  their indomitable courage and superior tactics, cast terror into the hearts of the  infidels. There were also warriors of tried courage, and unparalleled dexterity in  the handling of weapons, who in single combat with the Christian knights never  failed to gain the victory over their adversaries. We shall relate here an anecdote  which, like the preceding, we borrow from the writings of ’Ali Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahman  Ibn Hudheyl, of Granada. ‘“ Al-musta’in Ibn Hiid, King of Saragossa, made upon  “a certain occasion a successful invasion into the enemy’s territory. As he was  “* returning to his capital laden with plunder, and driving before him his prisoners  “and cattle, he saw from a distance a strong body of Christian cavalry waiting  “in a favourable position, on the road by which he had to pass, to attack  “him. When Al-musta’in came closer to them, he ordered the captives and  “ cattle to his rear-guard, formed his men in line of battle, and patiently waited  “ till the Christians should make their attack. The two armies were thus in  “ deadly silence waiting for the signal to engage in battle, when a Christian knight  “ of gigantic stature, clad in bright steel, and mounted upon a powerful black  ‘horse, made his appearance in front of the ranks, and challenged the Moslem  “‘ warriors to single combat. Presently a Moslem comes out to him, but, after a  “« few blows dealt and parried on both sides, the servant of God is unhorsed and  ‘« killed by his antagonist, the worshipper of the crucified ; seeing which, the infidels  “gave a shout of joy, and the faithful were afflicted and silent. Elated with-  “* success, the Christian knight rode his horse in front of the ranks, and exclaimed,  ““«Come on if ye dare, and if one be not sufficient, come three to one, I will fight  “ you all.’ These words filled the hearts of the Moslems with rage, but none came  ‘* out to fight with the Christian, who, proud of his victory, was cantering his horse  “ in front of the two armies, while the air resounded with the deafening shouts of his     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 129    “companions. In this extremity, Al-musta’in, whose heart was deeply afflicted to  “* see the shame falling upon his men, rode up to a captain of his, a man inured to  “battle from his childhood, and who had the reputation of being as brave as he  “« was dexterous in the wielding of arms. His name was Abi-l-walid Ibn Kayjin:  “ to him Al-musta’in went in his distress, and told him thus,—‘ O Abi-l-walid! hast  “ thou seen the arrogance of that Christian dog, and the insults he is heaping upon  “the Moslems?’ ‘I have,’ replied Al-walid, ‘but if my master grant me per-  “ mission to go out against him, I shall soon bring down his pride.’ ‘Thou hast  ‘it,’ said Al-musta’in, ‘and by Allah! if thou bring me his head, my gratitude for  “ the service will know no bounds.’ Having previously announced to the Chris-  “ tian that a Moslem champion would immediately appear, Abi-l-walid retired for  “a moment into his tent ; he put on a cotton shirt, and mounting on a milk-white  “ steed of his, which in swiftness far outstripped the winds, he rode out without  “ any other weapons than a scimitar by his side, and a long whip with a noose and  “an iron ball at the end in his right hand. When the Christian knight saw his  “ antagonist so whimsically arrayed,—‘ What,’ said he, struck with amazement,  “‘*when a Christian challenges the Moslems is there not in the whole army any  “ warrior to be sent against him but this groom with his whip?’ upon which he  “burst out laughing, and gave other evident signs of the contempt in which he  “held Abd-l-walid. However, they rushed furiously against one another; the  “ Christian, rising on his stirrups, aimed a dreadful blow at the head of Abi-l-  “‘ walid ; he avoided it by suddenly wheeling round his docile steed, and, turning  “as quick as lightning upon his adversary, struck him with his whip, entangled  “his neck in the noose, and, dragging him from his saddle, stretched him upon  “the ground. He then dismounted, and, drawing his scimitar, dispatched the  “ adventurous knight, whose gory head he threw at the feet of Al-musta’in.”   We need not expatiate any longer on the courage, the endurance, the discipline,  and other military virtues, of the Andalusian soldiers: suffice it to say, that so great  were their ardour in the pursuit, and their intrepidity in battle, that they became  almost proverbial in the East, where, according to Ibnu Sa’id, an Andalusian warrior  was synonymous with a brave man. It is true that, exposed as their country was  for so many centuries to the furious attacks of innumerable Christian nations,  dwelling within and out of its limits, the Moslems of Andalus found ample  opportunities to display and nurture in that vast field of battle their warlike  inclinations, to evince their ardent zeal for the propagation of Islam, and to show  at all times their eagerness to share in the rewards promised by God to the warriors  who fall in battle with the infidels. What nation, we ask, among those that  acknowledge the sublime truths contained in the Koran, showed a greater zeal   VOL. 1. 8     Hanghtiness  of temper.    130 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book 11.    for religion, more readiness to uphold its tenets, and a greater alacrity to run  to arms and win the crown of martyrdom? ‘What people on the face of the  earth maintained a longer, fiercer, and deadlier struggle than the Andalusians,  who for a period of several centuries had to defend foot by foot the land inherited  from their fathers, to irrigate with their blood every inch of ground conquered from  the infidels, and to oppose their stout breasts to the overwhelming forces and  innumerable swarms of the Christian nations, quickly succeeding each other, and  pressing onwards like the furious billows of a tempestuous sea? And when at  last they bowed down their necks before the irresistible laws of fate, is there any  one who can blame them for it? No! the impenetrable decrees of the Almighty  must needs be executed on his creatures. God is great! God is great! There is  no God but him, the merciful, the compassionate !   No nation on earth is so ‘proud as the Andalusians, nor more unwilling to bear  tyranny, oppression, or contempt: indeed their disobedience to their rulers, and  their want of respect and submission to their superiors, have become almost pro-  verbial. In illustration of what we advance we shall quote a few anecdotes. It is  related of Shajé’, a freedman of Al-musta’in Ibn Hid, king of Saragossa, that he  once went upon an embassy from his master to Alfonso, the Christian king.  Having arrived at Medinah Sélim (Medina Celi), where the infidel was then  holding his court, he was soon afterwards introduced to the presence of the  Christian monarch, whom he found sitting on a throne of great elevation raised  on the very tomb of Al-mansir, and having his wife by his side leaning on him.  After hearing his message, Alfonso said to him, ‘‘ O Shaj4’! I am the king of the  “Moslems, and the conqueror of their country: dost thou not see me sitting on  “the very tomb of the bravest and most powerful among their kings?’ When  Shaja’ heard these expressions so injurious to his countrymen, he could not restrain  his passion, and he said very spiritedly, ‘If he whose remains lie under that  ‘“‘ marble were alive, and thou sitting so close to him, thou wouldst not say with  ‘impunity things offensive to him, neither wouldst thou occupy long the place  ** thou now art in.” ‘ Alfonso caught the allusion,” says Shaja’, “‘ and flew into a  “‘ most violent passion ; he rose from his seat, intending no doubt to strike me,  ‘but his wife interfered and said to him, ‘ This man is right; why should not  ‘* honour and glory reside in his countrymen as they do in thee ?’”   Another act is recorded of the Hafedh of Andalus, the Imém of the learned, the  chief of authors, the pearl of the poets, and the phcenix of his age, Abi Mohammed  ’Abdullah Ibn Ibrahim As-sanhdji Al-hijéri,!® the author of the Al-mas‘hab (chatterer).  He once called upon business at the castle of ’Abdu-l-mélik Ibn Sa’id,'? the  ancestor of ’Ali Ibn Misa, the author of the Al-mugh’rab, a work which we have     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 131    often quoted in the course of this narrative. Having alighted at the gate, he  knocked and asked for admission, but the sentry, who saw him arrayed in the  Beydawi dress, not knowing who he was, refused to let him in. After some  parley held with the guards at the gate, which was all of no avail, Abii Mohammed  addressed one of them and said, ‘‘ If thou do not let me go in, at least acquaint the  “ governor with my presence, and inquire whether it is his pleasure to see me.”  “ What !”” said the soldier, bursting out laughing, ‘thou see the governor! dost  “thou think that our Lord has nothing else to do but to admit thee to his  “ presence ?””? Abii Mohammed then retired a little apart, and, taking a reed-pen  and an ink-stand which he always wore suspended at his girdle, he wrote on a  piece of paper the following verses :  “ The illustrious governor of this castle never dismisses from his door the  « people of rank and merit.  “« There is now standing on the threshold a man from Silves, with an ode  “ which begins thus—  “««T have been possessed with an idea to sing thy praises, and to record thy  “ beneficent actions.’  “ Tf, after this, my Lord thinks that he ought to deprive himself of the sight of  “ one of his countrymen, and of the pleasure of listening to an ode of this description,  “he may, for he knows best what to do, and it is not for me to upbraid him.” He  then ordered one of his pages to take his letter to the governor, and waited outside  for the result. When the Kéid ’Abdu-l-mélik had perused the contents of the letter,  he wondered at it, and said immediately, ‘‘A man from Silves, with an ode be-  “ginning thus,—who can it be? unless it be the Wizir ’Ammér who has risen  “ from the dead, I know of nobody else answering the description,—let him come  “in.” Abt Mohammed was then introduced into the presence of the governor,  who was sitting with some friends; he entered the room, but instead of bowing  to the K4id, or addressing the company, he stood motionless at the door ; seeing  which, the people who were present took him for a rude and ill-bred man; they  tumed their backs upon him, and affected the greatest coolness and indifference : at  last, seeing that he still remained in the same position, one of the company said to  him, “What ails thee, O stranger? why dost thou not enter this room in the  “manner poets and all well-bred people do, and salute the governor as is the  “custom?” ‘I shall neither bow to the Kdid,” replied Abi Mohammed, “ nor  “ pay any attention to you, till I have made you all as angry and out of humour as  “ you made me by keeping me waiting so long at the gate of this castle, and till  “ you tell me who among you is the most favoured by the governor, in order that I  “ may in future, by courting him and gaining his favours, be sure of not receiving     Devotion to  their friends.    132 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK II.    ‘“more outrages at his door.” ‘ What!” exclaimed the governor, ‘dost thou  ‘* mean to charge us with the faults of the stupid? Dost thou intend to revenge on  ‘us the errors of other people?” ‘No, God forbid!” replied Abi Mohammed,  ‘“‘T am, on the contrary, willing to forgive for thy sake the failings of others.”  When Aytib Ibn Matriéh revolted against ’Abdullah Ibn Balkin Ibn Habis,    -king of Granada,”' in the fifth century of the Hijra, and the seas of civil war    swelled and rose high in those districts, it happened that among those thrown by its  waves against the shore Aytib was one. The case being reported to Yusef Ibn  T4shfin, he was deprived of command and sentenced to death, with many others  among the rebels. When the executioner came to strangle him, his friends and  all those who were present, and who knew the great regard which Ibn Tashfin  entertained for him, begged him to say something in his favour, that it might be  reported to the Prince and obtain his pardon; but Ayib being a man of great  courage and determination, and exceedingly proud, would not consent to it; he  put his head within the noose, and, persisting in keeping it there notwithstanding  the entreaties of the bystanders to induce him to take it out and pronounce a word  of repentance, he soon met with his death,—may God forgive him !   It is related that the Wizir Al-walid Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmén Ibn Ghdnim™ was on  terms of intimate friendship with another brother Wizir, named Hashim Ibn ’Abdi-  1-’aziz ;> both exercised the same functions to the Sultén of Cordova, Mohammed,  son of ’Abdu-r-rahmdn Al-améwi, of the family of Merwan, and had on several  occasions evinced their mutual love and affection, till Al-walid gave that proof  of attachment to his friend which forms the subject of this anecdote. When God  Almighty permitted that the Wizir Hdshim should incur the displeasure of the  Sultdn, and should be sent by him to prison, there happened to be at the palace a  council meeting, at which Al-walid was present in his capacity of Wizir. The  conversation having turned on the disgraced functionary and the misdeeds imputed  to him, the Sultan Mohammed, then addressing the assembly, spoke very slightly of  him, and accused him of frivolity and inconstancy, as well as of obstinacy and too  great a reliance on his own opinions. No one among those present undertook the  defence of the accused Wizir but Al-walid, who, rising from his couch, said,  “ O Prince! may the Almighty favour and prosper thee! Were I allowed to speak  ‘one word in behalf of my friend, I should say that it is not in the power of a  ‘* mortal to contend against fortune, or to escape the immutable decrees of fate.  “ Hashim did all he could, he consulted with the greatest care his friends and  “ advisers, and he fulfilled all the duties of a brave and experienced general; but  ‘if success did not attend his banners, it is no fault of his, for victory does not  ‘* always depend upon the general ; it is well known that he was betrayed by those     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 133    “in whom he trusted, and deserted by those who stood near him, while he  “ himself never moved from the spot intrusted to his care, and never abandoned  “ the field of battle till the defeat and dispersion became general ; instead of shame-  “ fully turning his back to the enemy, he fought to the last like a brave man;  “ and God has certainly rewarded him for his virtues, for if his master the Sultén  “ has deprived him of his honours and dignities, he still possesses the esteem of his  “friends, who see nothing in his last conduct which is deserving of reproach.  ‘« Besides, if he did not die on the spot intrusted to his custody, or in the midst of  “ the enemy’s ranks, it was because he thought that it would be a nobler action to  “ spare himself, and that a life spent in the service of his Lord was better than an  “ unprofitable death. I have no doubt but that he has been slandered and calum-  “ niated by people who were envious of him, and who looked with an evil eye upon  “the favours lavished on him by his sovereign.” Mohammed was not a little  surprised to hear this speech of Al-walid ; he complimented him upon the strength  of his attachment to his friend, and his anger against Hashim being in a great  measure removed, he some time afterwards gave orders for his liberation.   Were we here to record the brilliant acts of justice which are told of the various  Sultans who reigned over Andalus, we should insensibly protract our present  narrative to an interminable length. However, as the distribution of justice with  an even hand is among the brightest qualifications of a sovereign, and one which  many of the Andalusians possessed in a superior degree, we shall here select a few  of the most striking anecdotes. As Al-manstir Ibn Abi ’A’mir was once sitting in  the audience-room of his palace, in came a man of the lower classes, and addressed  him in the following terms: ‘“O defender of truth ! O dispenser of justice ! I have a  ‘complaint to make against a servant of thy household; there he is, standing  “at thy side;” and he pointed to one of Al-manstr’s chief eunuchs, who,  being a favourite servant of the Hajib, exercised besides the functions of shield-  bearer™ near his person. ‘I have,” continued the man, ‘‘ summoned him several  “times to appear before the magistrate, but in vain; he has never come at the  “« appointed hour, I am tired of sueing him, and I thought I should never get any  “redress unless I came to thee.’’ Al-mansir then said to the man, ‘‘ Dost thou  “* really mean to say that thou hast a complaint to make against ’Abdu-r-rahman  “ Tbn Foteys?” Is it he whom thou accusest of thus disobeying the rules of justice?”  “The same,” replied the man. ‘‘ [should have thought,” said Al-mansir, frowning,  “that ’Abdu-r-rahm4n would have been the last person in my household to commit  “such a crime. Let us then hear thy grievance.” The man then stated that  he had entered into a contract with ’Abdu-r-rahman, by which both parties were  bound towards each other to the fulfilment of certain conditions, and that ’Abdu-r-    Justice.     134 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    rahman had of late without any sufficient reason refused to observe it. Al-mansir  then said, ‘‘ There is no servant in my household that I love more than him,  “* (darting on the Sclavonian a look by which he was almost annihilated,) but, by  “ Allah! justice must be done. Pass thy shield to thy neighbour, and come down  “before me, that I may send thee where thou mayest meet thy accuser, and be  “ either extolled or depressed by truth.” Then addressing his Sdhibu-sh-shartah,  intrusted with the execution of his private orders,—‘‘ Take that wretch, that criminal  “man, by the hand, and lead him together with his accuser before the magistrate,  “that he may investigate the case, and impose on him the punishment he  “* deserves ; and mark well, let the sentence, whether it be imprisonment or fine,  “be as rigorous as possible.” The Sahib did as he was ordered ; he took both the  parties before the magistrate, and shortly afterwards the complainant appeared  again before Al-mansir, and said he had got redress, and thanked him for having  obtained justice through his means. ‘ Well,” said Al-mansir, ‘‘ begone ; justice  “ has been done thee, and thou art revenged; it is now for me to get redress for  “‘ my injury, and to chastise the crimes committed by the people of my household.”  Upon which he ordered that the Sclavonian should be exposed to all sorts of  humiliation and ill treatment, and he was at last dismissed from his service.   On another occasion there happened to be a lawsuit between his chief eunuch  Al-biraki and a western merchant; they had disagreed in some money matters,  and the merchant brought the case before a tribunal. However, the eunuch being  at the head of Al-mansir’s household, having the entire management of his house  and harem, and possessing the confidence and favour of his master, was, as may  well be supposed, a very influential person in the state, and the magistrate pro-  nounced a decision in his favour. The merchant then appealed ; but the magistrate,  thinking that a man of high rank, and holding such an important situation as  Al-biraki did, could not be guilty of the breach of faith imputed to him, dismissed  the appeal. The merchant, however, was not disheartened, and he resolved upon  having justice, come what might. As Al-manstir was on a Friday riding to the  mosque, the merchant placed himself before his horse, and implored his justice  against Al-biraki. Al-manstir immediately ordered one of his escort to ride back  to his palace, take the eunuch into custody, and conduct him again before the ma-  gistrate, to whom he sent a message enjoining him to look again into the case.  The suit was tried, the eunuch convicted, and the merchant redressed. Al-mansiir,  moreover, was so much incensed against the culprit, that, after depriving him of all  the favours he had previously lavished on him, he dismissed him from his service,  and exiled him from Cordova.   The following act of justice is also recorded of Al-mu’atassem Ibn Samadeh,     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 135    king of Almeria. When that prince began to build the famous palace which, after  his name, was called As-samddehiyah, the architects, not finding room enough to  execute their plans, seized on some houses and fields adjoining the palace, and  united them to the main building. There happened to be among the pieces of  ground thus appropriated by the builders a small orchard belonging to a good old  man, who more than any other resented and opposed the spoliation, on the plea  that the piece of ground did not belong to him, but was the property of an orphan  of whom he was the guardian. As Al-mua’tassem was one day inspecting his  building, seated in his garden by the side of an artificial rivulet,” which was made  to wind through it, his eyes fell on something floating on the surface of the water,  and which, when taken up by his orders, proved to be a hollow reed, stopped with  wax at both ends. When the wax was removed, Al-mu’atassem found inside a  scroll of paper, in which the following words were written. ‘‘O thou! whoever  “ thou mayest be, into whose hands this scroll may happen to fall, remember those  “ words of the Almighty, ‘ This my brother has ninety-nine ewes, and I have only  “ one, and he said to me,—Do intrust her to my care,—which I did, but his words  “ proved false, and he deceived me ; there is no God but God !’* Thou art a king on  “ whom God has lavished his favours, making thee wealthy and powerful on earth,  “and yet, far from being satisfied, thy ambition prompts thee to covet the property of  “ others; and to add to thy spacious gardens a piece of ground belonging to an  “orphan, thereby committing an unlawful act, depriving a defenceless girl of all  “ means of subsistence, and taking advantage of thy power, and the importance of  “ thy situation, to do what is unjust. We shall to-morrow appear in the presence  “ of Him who never dismisses the wretched without aid or consolation, nor the  “offended without redress, and then beware of the consequences!” No sooner  had Al-mu’atassem perused the paper than his eyes were bathed in tears, and  his heart was possessed with fear at the terrible consequences which this incon-  siderate act of his servants might bring on him in future life; he immediately  commanded that all the workmen employed in the building of his palace should  appear in his presence, and when they were all assembled he interrogated them  as to what the anonymous paper stated, bidding them to expose the case, and  to tell nothing but the truth.: The masons then owned the fact, but alleged as  an excuse, that the piece of land occupied by the old man’s garden being absolutely  necessary for the finishing of the palace, the chief architect had deemed it indis-  pensable to seize on the orphan’s property, although unjustly and contrary to  the law. Upon which Al-mu’atassem, violently incensed, exclaimed, ‘‘ By Allah!  “sins of this description are much graver in the eyes of the Creator than they are  “in those of his creatures. Let the orchard be immediately restored to its owner.”     Forgiveness.    136 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    And so it was done, although it materially injured the front of his palace, which -  thus remained incomplete.   We have read somewhere that some of the principal and most learned citizens of  Almeria happening to pass shortly after this adventure by the palace of Al-  mu’atassem, one of them said to the others, pointing to the spot where the orphan’s  garden stood, spoiling the look of the building, ‘‘ By Allah! that orchard makes the  ‘* palace look as if it were a blind man.”—‘ Thou art right,” answered one of the  company, ‘‘ but in the eyes of the Almighty that spot constitutes its greatest  “ornament.” It is also related of Al-mu’atassem that whenever he cast his eyes  on it, he used to say “‘ I feel as if that empty spot in front of my palace was finet  ‘* than all the rest which is already finished.” However, in the course of time the  old man was prevailed upon to give up his ground; for Ibn Arkim,” who was  Al-mu’atassem’s Wizir, never ceased importuning the old guardian, and tempting  the orphan, till they consented to sell their property for the price which they  themselves fixed on it; the Sultan being thereby enabled to complete the building  of his famous palace, after performing such a signal act of justice as ensured him  the love and esteem of his subjects, and the future rewards of his Lord.   Nor was Al-mu’atassem famous only for such acts of justice as that which we  have just recorded ; he was also renowned for his benevolence and his forgiving  temper. It happened once that An-naheli Al-bathalidsi, a poet, to whom he  had been a very munificent and generous Lord, ‘all of a sudden left his court, and  repaired to that of Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbdd, king of Seville, where, regardless of  past favours, and showing the greatest ingratitude towards his former benefactor,  he began to praise the Sevillian monarch, who was not then on very good terms  with Al-mu’atassem. In one of his poetical compositions he introduced the fol-  lowing verse :   “ Tbnu ’Abbdd has every where routed and exterminated the Berbers; Tbnu  “« Ma’n has extirpated the fowls of the villages.” *°   However, it happened some time afterwards that An-naheli, forgetful of what he  had said, returned to Almeria; and no sooner did Al-mu’atassem hear of his arrival  than he invited him to an evening repast. An-naheli went accordingly to the  palace, where a numerous company was already assembled, and the tables spread, but  they contained no other victuals than a profusion of fowls dressed in various ways.  Astonished at what he saw, the poet could not help asking if there was no other  food to be procured in Almeria but fowls ; when the Sultan, rising from his couch,  said,—‘‘ Yes, but we wished to make thee pass for a liar, when thou didst say  “that Ibnu Ma’n had extirpated the fowls of the villages.” Upon which, An-  nahelf, trying to exculpate himself, said, ‘‘ God has given thee abundance of means,     CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 137    “and any one in thy rank of life would have done the same; but thy wrath ought  “rather to be directed against him who heard my expressions and repeated them  “ to thee.”   Al-mu’atassem answered nothing, and An-naheli left the room; but thinking  that he had incurred the wrath of the Sult4n, he feared for his life, and on his  return home he hastily made a few preparations, and left Almeria that same  night. :   However, some time afterwards An-naheli repented, and wishing to return to  Almeria he addressed to Ibnu Ma’n the following verses :   “ Tbnu Samédeh receives graciously those who deserted him; he pardons  “* crimes which the world after him will not pardon.   “« Almeria is a paradise, where every thing which Adam found may be  “ procured.” 3!   On the receipt of these verses Al-mu’atassem gave him leave to return, and was   kind and benevolent towards him.   sity is a virtue in which the Andalusians will not be found deficient by  those who peruse their history. It is related of the Amir Al-mundhir,® son of the  Sultan ’Abdu-r-rahman, that a slave-merchant once presented him with a beautiful  girl, named Tarab, who among other accomplishments possessed that of a sweet  voice, and great proficiency in music. No sooner had the eyes of Al-mundhir  contemplated her charms, and his ears listened to the ravishing melody of her  songs, than he lost his heart, and became deeply enamoured of his slave. Having  revolved ‘in his mind how he should reward the merchant, he called one of his  confidential servants, and said to him, ‘‘ What dost thou think we ought to give  “this man in return for his invaluable present, for this girl of incomparable  “ beauty ? ’—‘' O master!” answered the servant, ‘‘ methinks the best way would  “be to have her valued, and send him the amount in money.”—‘' Well said,”  replied Al-mundhir. A merchant was accordingly consulted on the subject, and  five hundred gold dindérs was the price set upon her. When the servant returned to  acquaint his master with the valuation, Al-mundhir said, ‘‘ Is that the proper reward  “ of a man who has presented us with a girl whose beauty has already captivated  “ our heart, and whose charms have won our affection? Are we only to send him  “ the sum thou hast mentioned, a sum which he would undoubtedly have received  “had he sold her to a Jewish merchant ?””—‘ Certainly,” replied the servant,  “but these merchants are an avaricious and miserly set, and every thing appears  “ inconsiderable in their eyes.”—‘‘ Never heed that,” said Al-mundhir, ‘“‘ we are  “liberal and bounteous, and ought not to stand upon trifles when we intend to  ‘* show our generosity ; take him one thousand dinérs, and give him our thanks for   VOL. I. T    Generosity.     138 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN {Book 11.    “« having given us the preference in making so valuable a gift, and tell him besides  ‘* that the girl he sent us occupies a place in our heart.”   Ya’kib Ibn ’Abdi-r-rahmdn, a brother of the above-mentioned Al-mundhir,  and belonging also to the royal family of the Beni Umeyyah, was on a certain  occasion praised by a poet, whom he caused to be rewarded with a very large  sum of money. On the return of a similar occasion the same poet came again to  him, with a poetical composition also in his praise—when one of Ya’ktib’s servants  remarked, ‘‘ This importunate fellow fancies no doubt that we owe him some-  ‘* thing, and he comes to be paid.” To which the Amir replied, ‘‘ Let him come ;  ** that only proves that the first visit he paid us was to him an agreeable one, and  “that he thinks well of us; I would not consent, for all the riches in this world,  “that he should alter the favourable opinion he has conceived of us.” Upon  which he gave orders for the admission of the poet, whom he treated kindly, and  after hearing his verses rewarded him with the same sum as before.   We shall not at present say any more on the brilliant qualities of the Anda-  lusians, but shall occasionally return to the subject when we come to the history  of their Sult4ns, Generals, Wizirs, Kadis, Poets, and other eminent men.",book_2,chapter_2

State of science in Andalus—Passion for books—Education—Ethics and Metaphysics—Rhetoric and  Grammar—Language—Hand-writing—Story tellers—Quickness at repartee—Memory—Their love of  science—Their talent for poetry—natural in children—Jewish and Christian Poets.    Respectine the state of science among the Andalusians, we must own in justice state of  that the people of that country were the most ardent lovers of knowledge, as well “""*  as those who best knew how to appreciate and distinguish a learned man and an  ignorant one ; indeed science was so much esteemed by them that whoever had not  been endowed by God with the necessary qualifications to acquire it did every thing  in his power to distinguish himself, and conceal from the people his want of  instruction ; for an ignorant man was at all times looked upon as an object of  the greatest contempt, while the learned man, on the contrary, was not only  respected by all, nobles and plebeians, but was trusted and consulted on every  occasion ; his name was in every mouth, his power and influence had no limits,  and he was preferred and distinguished in all the occasions of life.   Owing to this, rich men in Cordova, however illiterate they might be, encouraged  letters, rewarded with the greatest munificence writers and poets, and spared neither  trouble nor expense in forming large collections of books ; so that, independently  of the famous library founded by the Khalif Al-hakem, and which is said by  writers worthy of credit to have contained no less than four hundred thousand  volumes,’ there were in the capital many other libraries in the hands of wealthy  individuals, where the studious could dive into the fathomless sea of knowledge,  and bring up its inestimable pearls. Cordova was indeed in the opinion of every  author the city in Andalus where most books were to be found, and its in-  habitants were renowned for their passion for forming libraries. ‘‘To such an  “extent did this rage for collection increase,” says Ibnu Sa’id, ‘‘ that any man in  “ power, or holding a situation under government, considered himself obliged to  “have a library of his own, and would spare no trouble or expense in collecting     Education.    140 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    “books, merely in order that people might say,—Such a one has a very fine  “library, or he possesses a unique copy of such a book, or he has a copy of such  “a work in the hand-writing of such a one.” Of this passion for books Al-  hadhrami has recorded the following instance :—‘‘ I resided once in Cordova for  “ some time, when I used to attend the book-market every day, in hopes of meeting  “‘ with a certain work which I was very anxious to procure. This I had done for  ‘* a considerable time, when on a certain day I happened to find the object of my  ‘* search, a beautiful copy, elegantly written, and illustrated with a very fine com-  “‘mentary. I immediately bid for it, and went on increasing my bidding, but, to  “ my great disappointment, I was always outbid by the crier, although the price was  “ far superior to the value of the book. Surprised at this, I went to the crier,? and  “ asked him to show me the individual who had thus outbid me for the book to  ‘‘a sum far beyond its real value, when he pointed out to me a man, who by his  ‘« dress appeared to be a person of high rank, and to whom on approaching I said,  ‘« « May God exalt his worship the Doctor! If thou art desirous of this book I  “will relinquish it, for through our mutual biddings its price has risen far above-  ‘its real value.’ He replied, ‘I am no Doctor, neither do I know what the  “contents of the book are; but I am anxious to complete a library which I am  “* forming, and which will give me repute among the chiefs of the city; and as  “‘ there happens to be still a vacant place capable of holding this book, I thought  “*T might as well bid for it: besides, it seems to be neatly written, handsomely  “ bound, and in very good condition ; it pleases me, and therefore I do not care  “ how high I bid for it, for, God be praised, my means are not scanty !’—When  “T heard this,” says Al-hadhrami, ‘‘I was so much vexed that I could not help  ‘ replying to him, ‘ Well, thou art right, means are never abundant except with  “men like thee; and as the proverb says,—he gets the nut who has no teeth.>  ‘“‘T, who am acquainted with the contents of this book, and who know how to  “‘ appreciate its merits, am deterred from buying it, and profiting by it, through  «the scantiness of my means, whilst thou, to whom the acquisition of it is a  “matter of perfect indifference, art abundantly provided with money to -pur-  “ chase it.’.”   Notwithstanding the proficiency of the Andalusians in all the departments of  science, we are informed that there were no colleges in that country where the  youth might be educated and inspired with the love of science, as is the case in the  East ; there seem to have been instead several professorships attached to every  mosque, and numerous professors who delivered lectures on various subjects for a  fixed salary which they received ; and had it not been so, science could not have  flourished as it did, for learned men among them laboured with all their might in the     CHAP. II1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 141    acquisition of knowledge, disregarding every other consideration or occupation  » from which they might have derived emolument : this is the reason why Andalus  produced so many authors who reached the highest degree of superiority and  eminence in the several walks of science, as we shall have occasion to prove  when we review their literature. At present it will suffice to say that the  Andalusians left luminous tracks in every department of science, which they  cultivated with an ardour and success unparalleled among other nations, with the  exception, however, of natural philosophy and astrology, two sciences which,  although secretly cultivated by the higher classes, were never taught in public,  owing to the prejudices of the multitude against them ; for if a man of the lower  classes were to hear another say, “Such a one gives lectures on natural philo-  sophy, or is working on astrology,” he would immediately call him zindtk,* (that is,  heretic,) and the appellation might, perhaps, remain attached to the learned man’s  name during the whole of his life: even the length of this might in some measure  depend upon his prudence or his management ; since the lower classes being once  ill-disposed and prejudiced against him, they would, on ‘the least provocation, pelt  him in the streets or burn his house down, before the head of the state had even  been made acquainted with the offence. Sometimes the Khalif himself, in order to ~  conciliate the good will and affection of his subjects, would order the poor man  to be put to death, and a scrupulous search to be made throughout his dominions,  when all: works on the obnoxious sciences perished in the flames. This is even  asserted to have been one of the means employed by Al-mansir to gain popularity  with the lower classes during the first years of his usurpation, although, if we are to  believe Al-hijéri, he was himself an adept in those sciences, and worked at them  secretly. But of this more will be said in the course of our work.   The reading of the Kordn according to the seven different schools was, together Theology.  with the science of sacred tradition, held in the greatest esteem by the Andalusians ;  the professions ‘of law and theology were likewise much honoured and distinguished.  As to their sect, they followed at first that of Al-auzd’ei, as we have remarked  elsewhere ; but in the course of time they adopted that of Malik Ibn Ans, and  knew no other, this being considered the orthodox profession in the state. How-  ever, we read in the historians of the times that people of rank or learning occa-  sionally followed one of the others, and went so far as to dispute about their  respective merits in the presence of their sovereigns, whenever these were endowed  with the necessary penetration, tolerance, and love for the sciences. No title was  considered so honourable as that of Faquih,—indeed at one time it became such a  high and distinguished one that the Al-mulaththamin (Almoravides) gave it to  their great Amir, whom they wished to extol and distinguish; and the title of     Ethics and Me-  taphysics.  Grammar and  Rhetoric.    Language.    142 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN {Book 11.    Faquih in the West was, and is even to the present day, considered as honourable  as that of Kédi in the East. So it was that Kétibs, grammarians, and rhetoricians  were generally honoured with that distinctive title, although they might not have  gone through their degrees in the law; for, we repeat, the title of Faquih was the  highest and most honourable that could be given to any man learned in grammar,  rhetoric, metaphysics, theology, or jurisprudence.   Divinity and ethics were always cultivated with tolerable success, but grammar  and rhetoric were carried to the highest perfection amongst them. ‘So great is  “the ardour of the Andalusians in the cultivation of these two sciences,” says  Ibnu Sa’id, “and so vast their attainments, that I do not hesitate to say that  “ there are at present, in this country, authors equal in merit and parts to the most  “famous grammarians and rhetoricians in the times of Khalil® and Sibauyeh,®  ‘‘ who have written works that will pass to future generations, and withstand the  ‘“‘ plows of the destructive scythe of time. The various systems or schools into  ‘“‘ which the science of grammar has been divided are by them preserved with the  “ greatest care, and with as much attention as the different schools of divinity and  “« jurisprudence are kept in the East. So, every literary man, whatever may be the  “ nature of his studies, must needs be a grammarian in order that he may pene-  “ trate the subtilties of the language, and appreciate the merits of good. composi-  ‘tion ; for, if he be not perfectly conversant with all the rules of grammar, it will  “be in vain for him to- seek distinction; he will never rise in the opinion of the  “Jearned, whatever may be his proficiency in other branches of learning, unless he  “ be well acquainted with that one ; and he will be, besides, continually exposed to  “ the venomous shafts of criticism.   “The Moslem inhabitants of Andalus being either Arabs or Mista’rabs,’ their  “ language, as may well be inferred, was no other than Arabic. However, it  “cannot be said but that the common speech, both among the higher and the  “* lower classes, has considerably deviated from the rules of the Arabic grammar ;  “so that were an eastern Arab to hear the prince of our grammarians, Shalibin,  ‘* engaged in conversation with another man, he would never believe him to be the  “author so much consulted and valued in this country, and whose works are  “ circulated and read both in the East and West ; and were he to attend one of his  “lectures he would undoubtedly burst out laughing to hear the blunders he  “ makes in speaking. It is true that people of high rank will occasionally observe  ‘‘ the grammatical rules in their speech, especially if conversing with Arabs newly  “ arrived from the East, but, instead of being natural, their speech then sounds  “heavy and affected. However, what I have stated about the language used in  ‘« Andalus must be applied only to the Arabic as used in conversation, and by no     CHAP. 111.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. . 143    “ means to their writings, for they are the most strict and rigid of men in observing  “the grammatical rules in their theological writings, sermons, epistles, history,  “and all sorts of literary works, whether in prose or in verse.”   The Andalusians had also a hand-writing of their own; in former times they Hand-writing.  used the Eastern hand, they afterwards left it and adopted another, which, although  resembling that which is generally used in Syria and other Moslem countries, was,  nevertheless, distinguished by a few peculiarities. Tbnu Sa’id, treating on the  subject, says, ‘The Andalusian hand,® which originated in the East, is in my  “opinion without a rival in point of elegance and distinctness,? and, if I may  “judge of the ancient writing by such specimens as I saw of it in the Korén  “written by Ibn Ghatttis, which was preserved in a city in the eastern part of  “ Andalus, and in other ancient copies of the Korn referred to by the learned of  “that country as specimens, it is a very handsome and clear hand, and what I saw  “was executed in a style which did much honour to the patience and dexterity of  “ the scribes.” ‘   We find, likewise, that the Khalifs and other principal citizens of Cordova were Story teller.  excessively fond of listening to pleasant tales and entertaining stories, and that the  art of learning these, and reciting them in public, was considered a great accom-  plishment among literary men, who were thus enabled to approach the presence of  the Sultén, and by their wit and their humorous sallies insinuate themselves into  his good graces. This was, indeed, considered to be so important a requisite, that  whoever was not acquainted with a sufficient stock of entertaining tales, to recite at  pleasure, was held in little estimation, and even despised in certain literary circles.  Tbnu-1-khattib tells us in his history of Granada of a certain Abi-l-hasan ’Ali Ibn  Abi-l-halyi-l-ken4ni, who was a very facetious man, and knew by heart a prodigious  number of stories and amusing anecdotes, which he used to repeat to his friends ;  his life had been one of continual adventure, and they say that he had gone through  wonderful chances and changes of fortune. The stories told by this man were put  down in writing by some studious men, and collected in one book, under the  title of Kitdbu-l-mesdleki wa-l-mahdlli ft akhbdri-bni Abt-l-halyi'® (the book of  routes and stations in the adventures of Abi-l-halyi). Abi-l-halyi died in 406 of  the Hijra (a.p. 1015-16).   The Andalusians have been justly celebrated for the quickness of their answers, Quickness at  and that facility of repartee which puts a stop to further reply; in them wit, oun  humour, acuteness of mind, and talents for poetry, seemed to be almost innate, so  that it was not an uncommon thing to see among them uneducated youth, and even  children, display those talents in a greater degree than grown up men trained in the  peths of learning. It is somewhere related by a doctor, a native of Almeria, that     Memory.    144 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    the K4di Abi-l-hasan Mukhtér Ar-ro’ayni,"""" who was renowned for his wit and great  eloquence, happened once to be summoned to the presence of his sovereign, Zohayr  the Sclavonian, king of Almeria, who, being then occupied in administering  justice in the hall of his palace, wanted to hear his opinion in a certain legal case.  When Ar-ro’ayni received the summons, he hastened to obey it, and began to  walk towards the palace, although at a very slow pace, and in the grave and stately  manner generally used by K4dis. Zohayr’s messenger, who went by his side,  and who knew how impatient his master would be, advised him to make haste,  and quicken his pace, but Ar-ro’ayni, disregarding his injunctions, continued to  proceed at the same slow rate, so that a considerable time passed before he reached  the Sultén’s palace. ‘‘ What ails thee, that thou hast tarried so long, O Ar-  ro’ayni ?” said Zohayr to him on his entering the audience-chamber. The Kadi  answered nought, but retracing his steps, and going back towards the door, he  there took a stick from the hands of an attendant, and lifting up with one hand  the lower part of his garment, he assumed the air and put himself in the position of  a man who is going to run. ‘ What is the meaning of all that?” said the Sultan,  astonished. ‘This means,” answered Ar-ro’ayni, “that I am going to take  “ possession of my new office, for as I was coming to thee, seeing that this thy  “usher urged me to quicken my pace, and make haste, it occurred to me that I  “might have been deprived of my place of Kadi, and appointed instead to be a  “ soldier in thy body-guard ;”'* upon which Zohayr burst into a hearty laugh,  and from that moment he never afterwards reprimanded him for coming too late.   As Az-zahri,'* a famous preacher in Seville, who was lame of one foot, was on a  certain evening walking with a son of his, a youth, on the banks of the Guadal-  quivir, he saw a party of young men coming down the river in a boat, frolicking  ‘and singing. It was then near the Passover, the time when our dogmas prescribe  to us to sacrifice victims and distribute their flesh to the poor, and among our  friends and relations. As the boat was passing Az-zahri, one of the party shouted  to him, ‘ How much for that lamb of thine?” meaning his son,—and Az-zahri  answered immediately, ‘‘ He is not for sale.” ‘‘ Well, then,” replied another,  ‘‘ what is the price of the old ram?” meaning the father; upon which Az-zahri,  without being at all disconcerted, raised his lame foot in the air, and said, ‘‘ Dost  “thou not perceive that the animal is lame, and therefore unfit for sacrifice ?”  —hearing which the whole party in the boat burst into a laugh, and were im-  pressed with admiration at the Sheikh’s ready wit and good temper.   Memory is among the gifts which the Almighty poured most profusely upon the  Andalusians, and their history abounds with records of poets and authors whose  retentive powers were really surprising. Among others, a learned man named     CHAP. 111.) DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 145    Abi-l-mutawakel'® Al-haytham Ibn Ahmed Ibn Ghalib seems to have been the  phoenix of his age in memory, a real prodigy in learning by heart both prose  and verse. Ibnu Sa’id and his father Abi ’Omran, who knew him, bear ample  testimony of his extraordinary faculties. We shall let them speak: ‘I was once  “told,” says Abi ""Omran Misa Ibn Sa’id, “‘ by a trustworthy person, who was  ‘* present with him at an entertainment, what I am going to relate. ‘I was once  ‘« invited with other friends to the house of a rich citizen in Seville, where Abi-l-  “ mutawakel was one of the party; the conversation having turned upon his  “ extraordinary powers of memory, Abi-l-mutawakel kindly volunteered to exhibit  “ them before the company, and proposed to do any thing that was suggested to  ‘‘him. Then one of those present said, ‘In the name of Allah, we wish thee to  “* tell us traditions from authenticated sources.’ ‘Very well,’ said he, ‘let any  ‘* one of you choose the rhyme, and I promise not to stop until you are all tired.’  “ Upon which, one of the company having fixed upon the letter kaf, he began  “ to recite traditions ending with a rhyme in the said letter ; and, although it was  “early in the evening when he began, he continued throughout the whole night,  “and did not stop until the morning.’   “Some time after this occurrence, I happened,” continues Abi ’Omraén Ibn  Sa’id, ‘‘ to meet him at the house called Dédru-l-ashrdf (the house of the Sherifs),  “in Seville. When I entered the room, the company were occupied in reading  ‘various works, and among others the collection of poems by Dhi-r-rommah ;'*  “ Al-haytham, who sat by the side of one of the individuals who was reading  “aloud to the others, went up to him and tried to snatch the book out of his  “hands; the reader, however, grasped it with both hands, so that Al-haytham  ‘was unable to accomplish his purpose. Then turning round to me, he said, ‘O  “ Abd ""Omran ! is it just that this man should deprive us of a book of which he  “does not know one single verse by heart, and that he should keep it from me who  “can repeat every line it contains ?? When the company heard this they were much  “ surprised ; for, although they all knew Al-haytham’s extraordinary powers, yet,  “ the book having been but recently published, so as scarcely to have afforded Al-  ‘‘ haytham sufficient time to read it, they all thought that he had said what was  “ untrue, and therefore proceeded to put him to the test, strongly suspecting that  “he could not recite at any length out of it. Al-haytham said immediately, ‘ Let  “one of you take up the book and follow me;’ upon which, he began to recite  “ verse after verse in a masterly style, without forgetting either a vowel or an  “accent, until he reached the middle of the book, when, night being far ad-  “« vanced, and all of us tired, we all at once besought him to stop, which he did,  “and gave him our testimonials that we had never witnessed or heard of such   VOL. 1. u     Their love of  science.    146 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    ‘*a wonderful memory as his, for certainly this was one of his most prodigious  ‘* performances of this kind ; and as the story was afterwards divulged by those who  “had witnessed it, Al-haytham’s reputation increased, and the performance was  “ applauded as it deserved.”   Abi-l-hasan Ibn Sa’id says, ‘‘the two preceding anecdotes I hold from my  “ father ; but I myself recollect having once seen this extraordinary man dictate  ‘* extempore, and at once, to three talbes, in the following manner: to the first a  “« kasstdah, to the second a maushahah,” and to the third a sajalah. Al-haytham  ‘ died, no doubt, during the siege of Seville by the troops of Al-bdji ;!® for he once,  “when the city was closely besieged by the enemy, sallied out with the garrison,  “ and was never heard of afterwards.”   Another anecdote is related by Abi ""Omar At-talamanki.'’® ‘I once entered,”  says he, “ the city of Murcia, when the people flocked round me to hear me read the  “ work entitled ‘ Wonderful stories of authors and books.’® I said to them—Here  ‘‘ is the book, fetch a man that may read in it; and I opened the work ready for  “his arrival. Behold! what was my astonishment when I saw them returning  ‘‘ with a blind man, whose name was Ibn Sidah, who began to recite it from top  “to bottom. Astonished at what I saw, I asked, and was informed that, although  “a blind man, he was gifted with so prodigious a memory that he could repeat  ‘‘ whatever he had once heard, and that having on a former occasion listened to the  “ reading of the said work, he now knew it quite by heart. This extraordinary  “man, whose entire name was Abt-l-hasan ’Ali Ibn Ahmed Ibn Sidah,” was not  “« only blind from his birth, but he was also the son of a blind man; he died at the  “« age of sixty, in the year four hundred and one™ of the Hijra, and is well known  ‘< as the author of the Kitdbu-l-muhkami ft-l-loghati (the book of the foundations of  “ the language).””   The love of the Andalusians for science is sufficiently proved by the numberless  anecdotes with which their biographical dictionaries and literary records are known  to abound. Abd Bekr Ibnu-s-sdéyegh, better known by the surname of Ibn Béjeh,”  once entered the great mosque of Granada,” and found a grammarian surrounded  by several youths, who were listening to his lessons. When they saw him come in,  they all rose, and exclaimed, in high spirits, ‘‘ What does the Faquih carry? what  ‘* does he say? how will he show his love for science?” And Ibn Béjeh answered,  “What I carry with me is twelve thousand dinars, here they are under my arm :”  and he produced twelve beautiful rubies, each of which was valued at one  thousand dindrs. ‘‘ What I say is that, valuable as these jewels are, they are still  “‘ inferior in my eyes to twelve youths working as you are for the acquisition of  “the Arabic language. And my way of showing my love to science is by drawing     CHAP. III.) DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 147    “lots among you, and giving away the best of these rubies :” and he accordingly  proceeded to do it. The preceding anecdote is transcribed from the work of Abi  Hayy4n the grammarian.*   Al-mudhdhafer Ibn Al-afttas, King of Badajoz, was, according to the historian  Ibnu-l-abb4r, of all the monarchs of his time the one who showed the greatest love  for science, and who rewarded the labours of the learned with the most liberal hand.  So great was his knowledge in all the branches of literature, so universal his attain-  ments in the sciences, so ardent his love of all sorts of information, that notwith-  standing his reign was one of continual agitation and danger, owing to the turbulent  times in which he lived, he still found leisure successfully to cultivate all the  sciences, leaving behind him that immense work in fifty volumes which raised  the admiration of both Eastern and Western writers; and in the composition of  which Al-mudhdhafer spared neither trouble nor expense, having previously col-  lected a rich and extensive library for the purpose. His work, indeed, which in  the East is known by the title of Al-mudhdhafert,® from the name of its royal  author, treats on universal science, being a repository of art, science, history,  poetry, literature in general, proverbs, biographical information, and so forth. Al-  mudhdhafer died in the year four hundred and sixty of the Hijra (a. p. 1067-8), and  in the words of Ibnu Hayyédn and Ibnu Bessdm, two authors who have written an  account of his life, he surpassed all the kings of his time in science and in learning,  as well as in virtue and brilliant qualities. Our readers, moreover, must not be  surprised at this, or think that we exaggerate when we say that Al-mudhdhafer’s  work was composed of fifty volumes. No, it is a notorious fact, and were we to  judge by other very voluminous works which are in existence, we should say that  it was the fashion among the Andalusian authors to protract their works to an  enormous length. We can, without going any further, quote Ibnu Hayyan’s large  historical work called Al-matin,?” in sixty huge volumes, and the Kitdbu-l-asmd  (the book of nouns) by Ahmed Ibn Ibdn,® Séhibu-sh-shartah in Cordova, in  one hundred volumes. Ibn Ibén died in three hundred and eighty-two (a.p.  992-3) ; we have seen in Fez some volumes of his work. Another instance of this  extraordinary fecundity is recorded by Ibn Alisa’ regarding an author of the name  of Abi ’Abdillah Mohammed Ibn Mu’ammar, a native of Malaga, who wrote a  Commentary on the Kitdbu-n-nabdt (book of plants) by Abi Honeyfah Ad-di-  nawari,” composed of sixty volumes. Ibn Alisa’, who knew him in five hundred  and twenty-four of the Hijra (a.p. 1129-30), reports him as being then one  hundred years old. We might likewise quote here the words of Ibnu Hayyén,  who positively asserts that at the death of Abi Mohammed Ibn Hazm, which  happened in four hundred and fifty-six (a.p. 1063-4), there were found in his     148 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    room no less than four hundred volumes of works on various subjects, such as  history, poetry, jurisprudence, theology, &c. And Ibnu Hayydn adds, on the  authority of Abi-l-fahl Ibn Hazm, a son of the deceased, that having calculated  the sheets of paper which were taken up by his works, he found them to be eighty  thousand. We could mention numeraus similar instances of the fecundity and  extent of Andalusian genius, but as this is a thing long since ascertained, and which  needs not our confirmation, we shall leave it for the present.    Their aptitude The aptitude of the Andalusians for all sorts of sciences will be likewise ac-    for learning.    knowledged by every reader conversant with their history and literature. We shall  not, therefore, dwell upon it; but as their inventions and improvements in the  arts and sciences, and their discovery of new and untrodden paths in the regions  of literature, are generally allowed materially to have increased the sources of our  knowledge, we deem it in place to mention, in a few words, those illustrious men  to whose labours, talents, or perspicuity, the sciences are indebted for their  advance, and who are placed by their countrymen at the head of their respective  faculties.   Abi-l-’abbds Kasim Ibn Firnds,®° the physician, was the first who made glass out  of clay,*! and who established fabrics of it in Andalus. He passes also as the first  man who introduced into that country the famous treatise on prosody by Khalil,**  and who taught the science of music. He invented an instrument called al-minkdlah,  by means of which time was marked in music without having recourse to notes or  figures.** Among other very curious experiments which he made, one is his trying  to fly. He covered himself with feathers for the purpose, attached a couple of wings  to his body, and, getting on an eminence, flung himself down into the air, when,  according to the testimony of several trustworthy writers who witnessed the per-  formance, he flew to a considerable distance, as if he had been a bird, but in  alighting again on the place whence he had started his back was very much hurt,   “for not knowing that birds when they alight come down upon their tails, he forgot  to provide himself with one. Mémen Ibn Sa’id has said, in a verse alluding to  this extraordinary man,— :   ‘* He surpassed in velocity the flight of the ostrich, but he neglected to arm  “ his body with the strength of the vulture.” *   The same poet has said in allusion to a certain figure of heaven which this Ibn  Firnds, who was likewise a consummate astronomer, made in his house, and where  the spectators fancied they saw the clouds, the stars, and the lightning, and listened  to the terrific noise of thunder,—   ‘“« The heavens of Abt-l-késim ’Abbds, the learned, will deeply impress on  ‘‘ thy mind the extent of their perfection and beauty.     CHAP. LI.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 149    “Thou shalt hear the thunder roar, lightning will cross thy sight: nay,  “ by Allah! the very firmament will shake to its foundations.   “ But do not go underneath (the house), lest thou shouldst feel inclined,  “* as I was, (seeing the deception,) to spit in the face of its creator.”* ,   The following verse is the composition of Ibn Firnds himself, who addressed it  to the Amir Mohammed.* .   “« T saw the Prince of the believers, Mohammed, and the flourishing star of  ‘* benevolence shone bright upon his countenance.”   To which Mimen replied, when he was told of it, ‘‘ Yes, thou art right, but it  “ vanished the very moment thou didst come near it ; thou hast made the face of  “the Khalif a field where the stars flourish ; ay, and a dung-hill too, for plants do  “ not thrive without manure.”   Abi ’Obeydah Moslem Ibn Ahmed,’” known by the surname of Sdhibu-l-kiblah,  because he always used to turn his face towards the East when he was saying his  prayers, was consummately skilled in the science of numbers, arithmetic, astrology,  jurisprudence, and the knowledge of traditions. But his principal skill was in  astronomy ; he was perfectly acquainted with the movement of the stars and other  heavenly bodies, and their influence on the body of man. He travelled to the  East, and performed his pilgrimage to Mekka, where he attended the lessons of  ’Ali Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz ; he also resided for some time in Cairo, where he learnt from  Al-muzani* and others.   Yahya Ibn Yahya, better known by the surname of Ibriu-s-saminah,* a native of  Cordova, was versed in arithinetic, astrology, rhetoric, prosody, jurisprudence,  traditions, history, scholastic controversy, and the meaning of verses; in all  which sciences he laboured with the greatest success. He also travelled through  the East, where he is said to have adopted and professed the religious opinions of  the Mo’tazelites.   Abi-l-k4sim Asbagh Ibnu-s-samh* excelled in the science of grammar, as well as  in geometry and medicine, upon which he wrote several valuable treatises. He also  composed various works on geometry, such as the Kitdbu-l-mad‘hali fi-l-hindasati  (a key to geometry), being a commentary on Euclid, another voluminous work on  the same subject, and two others on the Astrolabe; and astronomical tables  according to the doctrines of the Indian school, known by the name of Sind-  Hind.” ,   Abd-l-k4sim As-saffar*? was also a profound geometrician ; he was deeply versed  in the science of numbers and astronomy, and wrote, among other works, some  astronomical tables, which he composed according to the method of Sind-Hind, and  a treatise on the mode of constructing Astrolabes.     150 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    Abi Ishak Az-zahrawi** gained himself a name both as a physician and as a  geometrician. He travelled to the East, and on his return to his native country  published a very learned treatise on the mechanical arts,“ accompanied by examples  and illustrations.   Abi-l-hakem ’Omar Al-karmdani,“* an inhabitant of Cordova, acquired great  celebrity in arithmetic and geometry. He travelled to the East, and resided for  some time in the city of Harran,** where he frequented the schools of the learned.  To him belongs the honour of having introduced into Andalus the epistles of the  As‘hdbu-s-safé (the sincere friends) .*7   Abi Moslem Ibn Khaldin,** one of the noblest citizens of Seville, obtained  great celebrity through his knowledge of geometry, astronomy, medicine, and  natural philosophy. He left a disciple, named Ibn Borghiith,*’ who inherited  his extensive knowledge in those sciences, and was, besides, very accomplished  in mathematics. Ibn Borghiith left also several disciples who profited by his  lessons ; among whom we may reckon Abi-l-hasan Mukhtar Ar-ro’ayni,” the  famous geometrician and astronomer, and ’Abdullah Ibn Ahmed, of Saragossa,  who gained himself a name in geometry, algebra, and astronomy.   Mohammed Al-leyth*' was commended for his knowledge in arithmetic, geo-  metry, and the motions of the planets.   Ibn Hayyi,5? of Cordova, wrote on geometry and astronomy. He left Andalus  in the year four hundred and forty-two of the Hijra, arrived in Egypt, where he  resided for some time, and proceeded thence to Yemen, where he gained the  intimacy of its sovereign, the Amir As-solayhi,** the same who rose in those  districts and proclaimed Al-mustanser the ’Obeydite. That rebel sent him on  an embassy to Baghdad, the court of the Khalif Al-kéyem-biamr-illahi, which he  duly fulfilled, returning to Yemen, where he died some time afterwards.   Tbnu-l-wakshi,* of Toledo, excelled in geometry and logic, as well as in the  construction of astronomical tables and several other branches of knowledge which  it would take us too long to enumerate.   The Hafedh Abi-l-walid Hishém Al-washki®* was the most learned man of his  time in geometry, in the opinions of the philosophers,** grammar, rhetoric, the  obscure meaning of verses, prosody, the writing of risdleh, the canon and civil law,  the functions of a secretary,°’ and other departments of science, so that, as the poet  has said,—   “‘ He had sufficient science to be thought accomplished in every department  “* of it.’”5* ’   The Wizir Abi-l-motref ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Shahid*? was profound in medicine   and the natural sciences. He wrote a work on the various simples created by God,     CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 151    and which are used as medicaments ; and such were his patience, activity, and  talents, that he knew perfectly well the properties of every one of the simples  mentioned in his book, its strength, the degree of heat or cold which it possessed,  and its application to the cure of various diseases. This eminent man entertained  the opinion that diseases could be more effectually checked by diet than by  medicine, and that when medicine became necessary, simples were far preferable  to compound medicaments, and when these latter were required, as few drugs as  possible ought to enter into their composition. As a physician, Abi-l-motref  surpassed all his contemporaries; he performed wonders in the cure of acute  diseases and chronic affections, administering, as. we have observed, as little  medicine as possible to his patients.   The science of botany was considerably advanced by the talents and exertions of  Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Ahmed, better known by the surname of Ibnu-l-beyttar,® and a  native of Malaga, who not only wrote numerous works in which he most scrupu-  lously and minutely described the plants already known, but examined and analyzed  many which had never been discovered before his time. Ibnu-l-beyttar died  suddenly at Damascus in the year four hundred and thirty-four of the Hijra  (a.p. 1042-3), and according to some his death was occasioned by poison, which  he sucked while analyzing a plant brought to him, which he had never before  seen.   The Andalusians may safely be pronounced to have been gifted by the Al-  mighty with those shining qualities necessary to make a good poet,—-quickness of  thought, great command of language, a fertile imagination, and an extensive know-  ledge of men and things. These qualities indeed were not confined to the Moslem  inhabitants of Andalus, but were also, as we shall have occasion to show hereafter,  shared by women, as well as infidels. We ought not to wonder therefore if poetry  among them has left such visible traces, especially when poets have been on all  occasions much regarded by their kings, who rewarded their merits with bounteous  gifts and large pensions. It was the custom in Andalus for the most eminent poets  at the courts of the various Sultans to appear before them at certain festivities, and  on other great occasions, there to recite poetical compositions in praise of the  sovereign: by these means poets rarely failed in drawing upon themselves the  munificence of the monarch, who would reward them according to their merit and  their rank, unless it happened that times were calamitous, and ignorance prevailed,  although the former was more common. Many are the poems recited on these  memorable occasions which to this day excite the admiration, and provoke the  envy, of eastern poets; and the works of Al-fath Ibn Khakdén, Abt-l-kdsim Ibn  Bashkiiwél, Ibnu Sa’id, and others, who have written the lives of Andalusian    Their talents  for poetry.     152 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK 11.    authors, abound with extracts from their poems, sufficient to impress the reader with  an idea of the reach and extent of their genius, the sweet melody of their verses,  and the creative powers of their imagination.   It is related of Al-merwani, Sultan of Andalus, that in a correspondence which  he had with Nazér, the ’Obeydite Sultan of Egypt, there passed between them some  angry words, when Nazér wrote to Al-merwéni a letter full of insults, to which the  Andalusian replied in these words: ‘‘ Thou hast reviled us because we are known  “* to thee; had we been acquainted with thee in the same manner, we might have  “* given a proper reply: farewell.” They say that Nazdér was extremely hurt by  the answer, and never afterwards sought to quarrel with Al-merwéni, who is said on  a previous occasion to have written to him the following distich :   “ Are we not the sons of Merwdn,—that favoured family upon whom  “‘ nature has poured her richest gifts, and whom fortune has loaded with her  “choicest favours ?   ‘“‘ Whenever a birth occurs in our family, is not the entire earth illumined  ‘with joy at the appearance of the new-born child; do not the pulpits  “ shake to the sound of the proclamation of his name? ” ©   It is said of Ibn Dhi-l-wizérateyn Abi ’A’mir Ibni-l-faraj,* who held the  appointment of Wizir to Ibnu Dhi-l-nin, King of Toledo, that feeling once in-  disposed he sent for a physician, who prescribed to him to drink old wine.  Knowing that one of the Sultan’s pages possessed some, very old and of excellent  quality, he took pen and paper and addressed him the following lines, ex-  tempore :   “ Send me some of that wine as sweet as thy love, and more transparent  “than the tears which fall down thy cheeks.   ‘Send me, O my son! some of that liquor, the soul’s own sister, that  “I may comfort with it my debilitated stomach. I am thy servant.” *   The Sultan of Valencia, Merwdn Ibn ’Abdi-l-’aziz,* was an excellent poet. The  following two verses are recorded as having been repeated extempore by him on  the event of his learning that he had been deposed from his kingdom, to make  room for a man his inferior in every respect.   ‘« No wonder that a man has been found to succeed me in the government  “of this kingdom. “Tis true the day will dawn for them (the subjects); but  “they will have no evening.   “ His light will be like that of the stars in heaven, which never begin to  “ glitter until the sun is quite gone down in the West.” ©   Of this Merwan the historian Ibn Dih’yah has recorded many sallies of wit,  among which the following is one. ‘‘I entered,” says he, ‘“‘ the Sultén’s apartment     CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 153    “ one day, and found him making his ablution ; when he came to cleanse his beard,  “ which had just then begun to whiten, he eaid to me—  ‘ When I first saw these grey hairs I took them for harbingers of my ruin,  ‘ coming to announce to the body the moment of its destruction. _  ‘For in plants when the green turns white it is a sign of their withering  ‘and decay.’” ”   Al-mu’atassem, king of Almeria, having once received intelligence that some  expressions excessively injurious to him had been introduced into a poetical com-  position by a poet who frequented his court, gave immediate orders for his appre-  hension ; and after a long search made throughout his dominions, the culprit, whose  name was Khalf Ibn Faraj As-samir,® was secured and brought into his presence.  “ T hear,” said Al-mu’atassem to him, “‘ that thou hast been indulging thy satirical  “ propensities against me. I command thee to repeat the verses in which thou hast  “made allusion to me.”—‘‘ In the name of Him who has put me under thy  “ power,” replied the poet, ‘‘ excuse me, for never was harm intended against  “thee.” ‘‘ Speak out,” cried Al-mu’atassem impatiently. Then the poet repeated  with a submissive voice the following two verses :   “ T saw Adam in my dream, and I said to him, O father of mankind! men  “ generally agree   “That the Berbers are descended from thee. Yes, it is true, but none  “« dispute that Eve was at that time divorced from me.®   “These are my expressions, O Al-mu’atassem! but thou must hear now my  “reasons for uttering them. It is well known that Ibn Balkin, the Sultén  “of Granada, thirsts after my blood, and has of late spared no trouble to get  “at my person and sacrifice me to his unjust resentment. Since I have taken  “ refuge in thy dominions he has tried every means to circumvent and destroy me,  “and he has caused reports of all kinds to be brought to thy ears, in order that  “thou mightst be angry with me and order my death, and thus be the instrument  “ of his revenge, while all the responsibility of an unjust and tyrannical act would  “weigh upon thee.” ‘‘ Well, but tell me,” said the Sultan, ‘ those verses contain  “no personal invective against Ibn Balkin more than the opprobrium with which  “thou hast charged his race. I would swear thou saidst something else against  “ him.”—* So I did,” answered the poet immediately ; ‘‘ when I saw my oppressor  “ build himself a strong citadel within the precincts of Granada, I said—   ‘The son of Balkin has built himself a castle ; he has, like the silk-worm,  ‘ wrapped himself up in his silk ball.’”’ 7°  Al-mu’atassem then said to the poet, ‘“‘ If what thou tellest me be true I can  VOL. I. x     154 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    ‘* excuse thee, and pardon thy offensive language against the Berbers. However,  “* T leave to thy choice whether I am to treat thee kmdly, or to deliver thee into  “* the hands of thy enemy that he may revenge his outrage.” Khalf then imme-  diately replied with these two extempore verses :  “« Al-mu’atassem has given me to choose; but he knows well my inten-  “ tions.  ** Since he has uttered the word pardon, I have no doubt he intends to  ‘“‘ be generous, and protect me.” 7”   ‘By my soul!” exclaimed the Sult4n, “ thy wit is the wit of Ashittén. I  ‘* pronounce thee both safe and free.”” And from that moment Khalf lived at the  court of Al-mu’atassem, honoured and rewarded by his sovereign, until Al-mu’a-  tassem was deprived of his kingdom.’   As the poet Abi-l-kdésim As-sohayli was once sitting in his house in Malaga,  news was brought to him how his native place, the town of Sohayt in the neigh-  bourhood, had been attacked, plundered, and set on fire, and his friends and  relatives either killed or taken, by a troop of Christian marauders, who had made  a foray into the heart of the Moslem territory. No sooner did the intelligence  reach As-sohayli than he hired a horse and a man to take him to the spot ; and  when he arrived at Sohayl he alighted, and finding the place deserted he uttered  extempore the following verses :   ““O my country! where are thy chiefs amd elders gone? Where thy in-  ‘‘ habitants from whom I experienced so- much generosity ?   “To see thy deserted dwellings the sighing lover might doubt whether he  “is alive, for to his greeting no salutation is returned.   “‘ When I ask, no voice answers mine save the parting echoes; no sound  “ strikes the ears of the pining lover.   “ The dove, it is true, sings on the lofty trees, but his mournful intonations,  ‘* caused by the loss of his consort, melt the heart of the sensitive, and make  “the tears fall in copious streams.   “ O my home! how cruelly fate has acted with thee; since time, that never  “ forgives, has spared thee in the midst of general destruction.”   We have said elsewhere that the town of Sohayl was so called from the fact of  its being the only spot in Andalus from which the constellation called Canopus  could be seen. As-sohayli was a famous. poet, as may be seen in Ibn Khallek4n”  and other historians who have written an account of his. life. He was known also  by the surname of Abi Zeyd.   A poet from Almeria was once coming down the Guadalquivir in a boat; as he  came to that part of the river, near Shantobis,”” where the stream narrows con-     CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 155    aderably, exhibiting on both sides clusters of pretty buildings and pleasure-gardens,  with verandas looking on the river, he said, singing,—  “Tam tired of the river and the boats, as well as those who look on it from  “ Shantobis.  “ Indeed, were it a paradise, I would not change it for my plantation of sweet  “ basil at home.”   No sooner had he pronounced the last words of the second verse than a girl in  one of the houses close to the river put her head out of an arched window, and  said to him, ‘‘ From what country art thou, O singer?” and he answered, “I am  “ from Almeria.”—‘ And pray what is there so much to be admired which would  * lead thee to prefer it to the river of Seville, whose face is salt, and whose nape  “is scabby ?’—and this is no doubt one of the most clever answers that can be  imagined, since, angry at hearing him depreciate the Guadalquivir, she said ironi-  cally the contrary of what that river is famous for; it being notorious to every  reader that the waters of the Guadalquivir are as sweet to the palate as those of  the Nile, and that the mountains of Ar-rahmah, which form, as it were, the back of  its head, are so full of fig and olive trees, and so studded with vines, that the eyes of  those who visit that enchanting spot in the days of relaxation fall on nothing else  but verdure. So the girl was right when she gave that answer, since Seville is far  superior to Almeria in this respect.   Abi ’Amri Ibn Sdlim of Malaga says, ‘‘ I was one day sitting in my room, when  “all of a sudden I was assailed by a violent and irresistible desire of going to  “ Aljebbaneh.”* I therefore left my house and went in the direction of that place ;  “ but scarcely had I proceeded a few steps, it being summer-time, and the weather  “very hot, when I felt oppressed by the heat; and, changing my mind, I returned  “home. Still, when I reached my house, I could not help the temptation of going  “ out again ; but this time I bent my steps towards the mosque called Rdbitatu-l-  “ Ghobdr,”? where I met the preacher Abi Mohammed ’Abdu-l-wahhéb Ibn ’Ali  “ Al-mélaki, who on my approach said to me, ‘I have just this moment been  “ beseeching God that he should bring thee to my presence; and my prayer has  “been granted: God Almighty be praised for it!’ I then told him what had  “happened to me, and how I had been led by an invisible power to go out of my  “house. After this I sat by his side; and on his entreating me to recite him some  “ verses, I repeated the following of an Andalusian poet :   ‘ They stole from morning the colour of her cheeks; they borrowed from  ‘ the arak tree its slender and delicate form.   ‘ Innumerable jewels shone brightly on their bosoms; and they took the  ‘ glittering stars for a necklace.     156 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    ‘ Not content with the slenderness of the spear, and the agility of the an-  ‘telope, they still took from the latter the tender eye and the undulating  ‘ cheek-bone.’ ©   “No sooner,” continues Abi ’Amri, “had I uttered the last syllable of the  ‘* latter verse, than to my great astonishment I heard ’Abdu-l-wahhab give a piercing  “ shriek, and I saw him fall senseless on the ground. Having run to his assistance,  ‘I found him in a swoon, and it was not until an hour had elapsed that he again  “* came to his senses : when he said to me, ‘ Excuse me, my son, for there are two  ‘* things in this world against which I have no strength, viz. the sight of a pretty  “ face, and the hearing of good poetry.’ ”   They say that Abt-l-hoseyn Suleyman Ibnu-t-tar4wah, the famous grammarian  and poet, from Almeria, sitting one day with some of his friends at an entertainment  at his own house, there happened to be close at his side one of his most intimate  friends, who, when his turn came to drink, begged to be excused, and motioned  away the jar in which the liquor was presented to him. IJbnu-t-tardwah then  taking the glass from him drank off its contents; and finding that it struck cold  on his liver he said extempore—   “« Let the Sheikh and his equals, and all those whose conduct is worthy of  “« praise, blame me for what I have done.  “This I know, that when the young camel finds her load too heavy she  “ throws *' it on the full grown one.”  Poetry an ins We have said elsewhere that children in Andalus not unfrequently exhibited  culden. natural talents, and a facility of rhyming, which could not often be met with in  people of mature age, or who had had the benefits of education. In proof of this  we shall quote the following anecdotes, related by their writers. Ibn Abi-]-khissdl  Ash-shektri (from Segura) having, when still a boy, repaired to the city of Ubeda,  in order to study in the schools of that place, lodged at the house of the K4di Ibn  Malik. Happening one day to go out with him to an orchard, Ibn Malik picked  a bunch of black grapes, and holding it in his hand he said to Ibn Abj-l-khissal,  “Look at these grapes hanging from the stalk.” ‘‘Yes,’’ answered Ibn Abi-l-  khissal, in rhyme, “ like the head of an Abyssinian slave.” ‘‘ Well said!” replied  his master, who from that moment prognosticated that Ibn Abi-l-khissal would be  an eloquent orator and a good poet.   It is related by Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Zarktin that Abi Bekr Ibnu-l-monkhol® and  Abt Bekr Al-mallah, both born at Silves, and dwelling in Salobrefia, a town  on the southern coast, not far from Almeria, were so much attached to each other  that they looked as if they were brothers. Each had a son, still young, but who had  shown from infancy the greatest aptitude for science, and the most vehement desire     CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 157    of learning, so much so that, although too young yet to have their abilities improved  by education, they had already given repeated proofs of their proficiency and talents  by gathering the spears of preference in the hippodromes of literature. These two  children were continually attacking each other with satirical remarks and witty  sayings, by which means their talents for versification were exercised and improved.  However, Ibnu-l-monkhol happening one day to ride out together with his son  Abi ’Abdillah, he began to reprimand him for his conduct towards his young  friend, and said, ‘‘ Thy continual jests and satirical traits against Ibnu-l-mallah  “« will, I have no doubt, damp the intimacy existing between me and his father, so  “‘ pray do not attack him any longer, lest I should lose through it my friend  “ Abi Bekr’s love.” ‘‘I cannot help it,” replied his son, “if it is so, for it is  “* always he who begins the fray, and I only use in my own defence the weapons  “ of satire. The offender is always wrong, and it is but just that he should bear all  “ the weight of evil who begins with it.”* When Al-monkhol heard this excuse  of his son, he could not help saying, ‘‘ Well, if the case between you stands as  “* stated by thee, I exculpate and justify thee.” While this conversation was thus  going on between father and son, behold! they came up to a large water-pool in  the middle of the road, where frogs innumerable were filling the air with their  croakings. ‘‘ Go on,” said Ibnu-l-monkhol to his son, “the frogs are croaking in  “that pool.” ‘ Yes,” replied his son, ‘and with no sweet melody, troth.”  “ Their language was boisterous,” said the father. ‘‘ When they called the Beni  “ Al-mallah,” answered the son. However, when they heard the footsteps of the  travellers the frogs became silent, and a pause ensued also in the dialogue  between father and son while crossing the pool. At last, Ibnu-l-monkhol said to  his son, ‘‘ Thou hast become mute like these frogs.” ‘‘ When they collected for  “scandal,” answered his son. ‘‘ There is no help for the oppressed,” said the  old man; “and no rain for those who want it,” was the son’s reply.®   Certainly nobody will doubt but that this finishing of hemistichs is highly  deserving of praise; had it been executed by a learned man advanced in life it  would have commanded the greatest attention, but being, as it was, the work of  a mere boy, it was a most wonderful performance, and well worthy of remark.   Nor were readiness of wit and poetical talents confined to the Moslems, for we Christan ond  find them existing among the Christias and Jews who inhabited Andalus, (may  the Almighty God restore it entirely to the hands of the true believers!) For  instance, a Christian named Al-maza’ri, a native of Seville, where he resided, is  said to have extemporized the following verses in the act of presenting the Sultan  Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbdd with a hunting bitch : 5     158 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    “ T never saw a better cause of pleasure for those that are fond of sport, nor   a surer source of profit for those who desire gain,   “ Than this animal full of excellent qualities ; her colour might throw into   the shade the brilliant hue of a yellow tunic:   “ Like a bow in her shape, and yet she darts on-her prey more straight than   an arrow.   “If thou try her scent, she will guide thee to secret haunts abounding with   game. ,   “« Nay, were she to challenge the lightning to a hunting match, she would  “ leave it far behind in the race.” ®   These verses, and others by the same author, are recorded in the Al-mas‘hab of  Al-hijéri, who has therein introduced the Christian’s biography.   The following verses are the composition of a Jew, of the name of Ibréhim Ibn  Sahl Al-israyili,®” who is reported to have pronounced them extempore on a slave  who was ill with the jaundice : .   “« Thou wast an honour to thy master until thou wast thus deprived of thy  “ beauty.   “For thou didst appear in the morning like a wax taper, which, when  “ extinguished, shows a black wick.’”®   There are various opinions entertained concerning this Jew ; some saying that he  was in heart a Moslem, others that he publicly embraced Isl4m, and professed it  till the day of his death, others again that he lived and died in the Jewish persuasion.  Abi Hayydn, the grammarian, relates, on the authority of the Kadi-l-kod4é Abi  Bekr Mohammed Ibn Abi Nasr Al-fat’h Al-kaysi, who had it from ’Alf the Christian,  a native and inhabitant of Seville, whom he chanced to meet in Granada in one of  his travels, that Ibrahim Ibn Sahl the poet was at first a Jew, but that towards the  end of. his life he was converted to Islam, and wrote in praise of Mohammed,  the messenger of the Lord, a long and elegant kassidah. ‘I read it once,” says  Abi Hayydn, “‘and I declare that in point of melody it is one of the most admirable  ‘* poems I ever read in my life.”   The same opinion is entertained by the Hafedh Abi ‘Abdillah Mohammed  Ibn ’Omar Ibn Rashid Al-fehri,® who in his great itinerary entitled “the filling  of the knapsack with information collected during a journey to the two holy  places, Mekka and Medina,” asserts positively that Ibn Sahl embraced Isl4m,  quoting as a proof an epistle written by ’Ali HAmish to the preacher and ulema  Sidi Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Marzik,” and which reads thus: ‘‘I have been in-  “formed by a contemporary, who was well acquainted with him, that Ibn    Ti    “    “     CHAP. I11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. : 159    “ Sahl died a Moslem.” The same author (Ibn Rashid) quotes the following  anecdote, which he says he read in a certain literary work in the West, and which  would tend to prove that Ibn Sahi was really a Moslem: Ibn Sahl once re-  ceived in his house a company of literary men, and, the conversation happening  to turn on his religion, one of the party ventured to ask him whether he was  really a Moslem in. heart, as he professed: to be, or only affected it, upon which  he is said to have answered—  “« For men are the things apparent, for God only what is concealed.” *  As a further proof of Ibn Sahl’s conversion, the following two verses. of his are  adduced :  “Fam content with Moses for the sake of Mohammed; I am now in the  “ right path, but had it not been for Allah I should never have been directed.  “* What has made me change my mind is this, that I saw the law of Moses  “‘ was wanting in a Mohammed.” *   However, as we have already stated’, there are not wanting authors who assert  that Ibn Sahl’s conversion was a feigned one, and that he never abandoned the  Jewish creed. Ar-ré’ii® (may God show him mercy!) says, ‘‘ I was told by the  “ Sheikh Abi-l-hasan ’Ali Ibn Sama’t Al-andalusi,—‘ there are two things in this  “world to which I give no faith,—one is the conversion of Ibn Sahl, the other  “ Az-zamakhshari’s repentance for having joined the Mo’tazelites.’ But,” observes  Ar-ré’ii, ‘‘ I have better authority not to coincide in this author’s opinions: as to  “Tbn Sahl’s conversion, because, according to all received opinions on the subject,  “ Tam inclined to believe it was a sincere one ; and as to Az-zamakhshari’s repentance  “from the heresy. of the Mo’tazelites, because I myself saw in the East a legal  “ document stating that Az-zamakhshari™ had abjured the religious errors of that  “ sect.”   Al-’azz,® who wrote Ibn Sahl’s life, inclines to the contrary opinion, and thinks  that there are sufficient proofs to believe he was a Moslem ; but God only knows  the truth of the case. One thing however is certain, namely, that Ibn Sahl was  ene of the best poets of his time, as the collection of his poems sufficiently testifies.  He lived at Seville, where he was one of the elders of his tribe, and attended the  lessons of Abi ’Ali Ash-shalibin, Ibnu-d-dabbaégh,” and others. They say that a  western Arab, having been once asked the cause why Ibn Sahl could write in so    tender a strain, gave the following answer—‘ Because he unites two humilities, the ©    humility of the lover and that of the Jew.”   According to Abi Hayy4n, Ibn Sahl perished in a sea voyage; the vessel in  which he was embarked meeting with a tempest he was drowned with all the rest  of the crew. This happened in the year six hundred and forty-nine, and Ibn     160 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK 11.    Sahl was then forty years old or thereabouts. When the event became known in  Seville, another Jewish poet is said to have remarked very happily, alluding to  Tbn Sahl’s drowning, that ‘‘ the pearl had only returned to its shell.”   Tbréhim Tbnu-l-fakhkhér Al-yahtdi is another famous poet. He lived among  the Christians, and in the service of Alfonso, king of Toledo, with whom he rose  high in favour, so as to be appointed by him his ambassador to the court of  a Moslem Sultén in the West. In the opinion of all his contemporaries he was  an elegant prose writer, and a very good poet. Ibnu Sa’id, who mentions him, has  handed down to us some of his verses, among which are the following, which he  wrote in praise of his master Alfonso (may God annihilate him !)—   “ The court of Alfonso has always the appearance of a house prepared for  “ nuptials.   “ And the leaving of sandals at the door would persuade thee that thou  “ wast in Jerusalem.” ” .   The following anecdote is told of this Jew, who related it to the author from  whose writings we now borrow it. ‘I once went on a message from my master  “to the Khalif Al-mustanser,® and when I went to present my credentials to the  “ Wizir I found him sitting in one of the gardens of the palace, a charming spot,  “‘of the greatest beauty and luxuriance, resembling in every respect a paradise,  “ only that the gate-keeper was the ugliest and most disgusting creature I had ever  “seen in my life. When the Wizir asked me afterwards what I thought of the  “« garden, I said to him, ‘I would undoubtedly compare it to paradise, were it not  ‘‘ for one circumstance, which is that its gate, I am told, is guarded by Redwén,  “ and here I see Malik.’ The Wizir laughed heartily, and proceeded to acquaint the  “ Khalif with my answer. He then brought me the following reply,—‘ Tell the  “ Jew that such was my intention in choosing my gate-keeper; for had he been  “ Redwan, he would undoubtedly have sent him back, saying—Go away, this is  “ pot a place for those of thy religion to enter ;—while Malik, not knowing what is  “behind him, and thinking he keeps the gate of hell, allowed him to pass without  ‘resistance.’ When the Wizir communicated to me the Sultdn’s answer,” con-  tinues the Jew, “I could not refrain from saying, ‘ Well, God only knows who  “‘ those are who will enter paradise.’” ,   “Another famous Jew, whose name was Elias Ibn Al-mudawwar, a native of Ronda,  is mentioned by various historians ; he was an eminent physician, and a good poet.  The following two verses, which he addressed to another Jew, are much commended.  The occasion of his writing them was as follows. There was in the same city of  Ronda where Elias practised medicine another eminent Jewish physician, and, as  is often the case among people of the same profession, they were jealous of each     CHAP. 111.) DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 161    other, and were continually disputing and quarrelling. Their common friends often  interposed, and, by becoming the mediators in their quarrels, succeeded in making  them friends ; but at the first opportunity they broke out again, and the whole city  of Ronda was made the scene of their squabbles. At last, Elias having become, by  some means or other, the master of a certain secret concerning his antagonist,  which might, if made public, seriously affect his reputation as a physician, and  prevent the people from employing him, he wrote to his rival the following distich :  “Do not blame me (if I accuse thee), and let my excuse be the rivalry  “ which ought to exist between people of the same profession.  “ Look at the sun and moon when they illumine our globe; from their  “constant labours and rival courses light is produced :””  meaning, as they were both labouring to diffuse the rays of science, it was  necessary that there should exist between them mutual jealousy and division, in  order that through their mutual efforts to surpass one another, and by their pur-  suing different courses, the cause of science might be benefited ;—in the same  manner as the sun and moon, by following opposite roads, illumine the world:  the moon shining at night, and the sun by day-time; but the eclipse being  produced the moment they tried to approach each other.   A Jewish poetess, named Kasmunah, daughter of Isma’il the Jew, is also counted  among the bright geniuses of that nation. Her father, who was himself a man of  considerable learning and a good poet, had bestowed the greatest care on her  education, and imparted to her all the science which he himself possessed. He  used to compose part of an ode and then give it to her to finish. He once said to  her,—‘‘ Tell me who is   ‘“« The master of beauty, who fights and vanquishes those who oppose him,  “ and yet whose trespasses are excused ?”  And she replied, almost immediately,  “The sun, which imparts its light to the minor constellations, and whose  “ face after this appears quite dark.” '   But having proceeded so far in our endeavours to prove the aptitude and talents  of the Andalusians for poetry, we should be guilty of negligence if, before termi-  nating this chapter, we did not say a few words about the wives and daughters of  the Moslems who made themselves conspicuous by their talents, and who showed  their wit and eloquence in elaborate and ingenious poems.   Ummu-l-sa’d, daughter of ’A’ssem Al-himyari, a native of Cordova, was learned aaa  in sacred traditions, which she held from her father, her grandfather, and others. poetry.  According to Ibnu-l-abbar, who has devoted an article to her in his biographical  dictionary entitled At-tekmilah'™ (supplement), she was better known by the sur-   VOL. I. Y     162 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book ""11.    name of As-sa’diinah. Among the numerous poetical compositions which we find  ascribed to her the following distich deserves particular mention :  “ Men generally court the friendship of strangers, and avoid any intercourse  “ with their own relations ;  “ For relatives are like scorpions, or worse than they.”   The Khattib Ibn Marztk, by whom this distich has been preserved, attributes  it to the above-mentioned poetess ; we have seen it quoted elsewhere as the com-  position of Ibn ?Omayd. But God only is all-knowing.   Hasanah Al-yatimah, daughter of Abi-l-hoseyn the poet, and Ummv-l-’olA,  daughter of Yiisuf, were also two famous poetesses. The latter is mentioned by  the author of the Al-mugh’rab, who speaks of her as a native of Guadalaxara, and  as having flourished in the sixth century of the Hijra. Some of her verses may  be seen in the said work.   Ummatu-l-’aziz Ash-sherifiyyah was, as her name sufficiently indicates, of the  posterity of Hasan, son of ’Ali Ibn Abi Talib. The Héfedh Abi-l-khattéb Ibn  Dih’yah, who was a descendant of hers, has preserved to us in his Kitdbu-l-muttreb  min ash’dri-l-maghreb*® (the book exhibiting songs extracted from the works of  western poets), some of her verses, which are sufficient to rank her among the  eminent poets of her time.   Al-ghosdniyyah,'’™ a native of Bejénah, a considerable and famous district in the  province of Almeria, is likewise counted among the poets who flourished in the fifth  century of the Hijra.   Al-’aridhiyyah,'’® a freed slave-girl belonging to Abi-l-mutref ’Abdu-r-rahman  Ibn Ghalbiin the Katib, was another distinguished female. She lived at Valencia,  where she was taught by her master grammar and rhetoric, in both which branches  of knowledge she soon made such progress as to surpass her teacher. She also  shone in prosody, and learnt by heart and wrote commentaries on the Al-kdmil of  Al-mubarrad, and on the An-nawddir of Al-kéli. Abdi Détd Suleymén Ibn  Najah says, “I read under her direction the two above-mentioned commentaries,  “ and learnt from her the science of prosody. She died at Denia, some time after  “her master’s death, in the year four hundred and fifty of the Hijra, or there-  “ abouts.” (May God show her mercy !)   Hafsah ’Ar-rakiniyyah, daughter of Al-hdji Ar-rakini, was equally renowned for  her beauty, her talents, her nobility, and her wealth. A notice of this famous poetess,  as well as a selection from her verses, occurs in the work of Al-maléhi. The  following, which she is said to have uttered extempore in the presence of the  Prince of the believers ’Abdu-l-mimen Ibn ’Ali when about asking him for a  favour, are justly commended :     CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 163    ‘** O master of men! O thou whose gracious favours the people anxiously  “ and confidently expect !  “« Grant me a diploma, which may be a promise to thy subjects ;  “* One upon which thy right hand has traced—‘ Praise be to God, the only  “ one.’ 7? 106  The poetess here alludes to certain signs of royalty introduced by the Sultans of  the dynasty called Al-muwdhedtin (Almohades), and which consisted in writing at  the top of their dispatches, with a thick pen and in very large characters, ‘“‘ Praise  “* be to God, the only one.”   With this Hafsah the Wizir Abi Ja’far Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-l-mélik Ibn Sa’id  Al-’ansi'”” lived on terms of the greatest friendship and intimacy. They were  continually addressing to each other epistles and verses, and their mutual answers  can only be compared to the language of doves. We learn from Abi-l-hasan  ’Ali Ibn Misa Ibn Sa’id, the author of the Al-mugh’rab,—a work to which we own  ourselves very much indebted for our information,—and who was the descendant  of this Abi Ja’far, that he heard his father say, ‘‘ I know not among the Beni  “« Sa’id of any poet like him ; or rather, I know not among my countrymen of any  “who ever surpassed Abi Ja’far in poetical composition.” Some account of this  noble Wizir, extracted from the work of his descendant Ibnu Sa’id, will not, we  hope, be deemed superfluous.   Abi Ja’far was the son of ’Abdu-l-m4lik Ibn Sa’id, Lord of Kal’at-Yahseb, a  place not far from Granada, and the scene of the adventure which we have related  in a former part of this book as having happened to the famous poet and historian  Tbnu-l-hijari. At the arrival of the Beni ’Abdi-l-mimen in Andalus, ’Abdu-l-milik,  who had embraced the opposite party (that of the Almoravides), took an active  part in the contest, and managed to maintain himself independent in his little  dominions. His son, Abi Ja’far, he appointed to be his Nayib or lieutenant, that  he might aid him in the perilous duties of the administration, and in the defence  of his state. However, Abi Ja’far, who knew how to handle the pen better than  the sword, soon perceived his own inability to meet the exigencies of the charge,  and begged his father to exonerate him from it and appoint another in his stead.  This request ’Abdu-l-mélik refused to grant, but his son, not being able to bear  any longer the important duties attached to his situation, deserted him, and left  public affairs in order to enter into private life, after having written to his father a  beautiful epistle in verse, in which he expatiated at full length upon the comforts  and advantages of private life. They say that when ’Abdu-l-mélik read his son’s  epistle, he exclaimed, ‘“‘ Well, I shall not go against his will, for God Almighty  “ does not permit that men should succeed in things for which they feel no inclina-     164 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    “tion.” After this he wrote on the back of the letter, ‘‘ We send thee our  “ benediction, and grant thee permission and full liberty to occupy thyself in such  ‘* pursuits as answer best thy inclination.”   *Abdu-l-malik could not long maintain his independence ; all the Andalusian  chiefs having submitted to the Beni ’Abdi-l-mimen, he was himself constrained to  acknowledge them as masters, and tender the oath of allegiance, owing to which  he not only retained the government of Kal’at-Yahseb, but rose high in favour  with the Sultans of that dynasty. In the meanwhile Abi Sa’id Ibn ’Abdi-l-  miimen was appointed to be governor of Granada, and being in want of a secretary  he began to inquire among the inhabitants for a person fit for the place. He was  told that Abi Ja’far was the man most suitable, from his learning, his talents, and  ability, to discharge the duties of Katib; he accordingly sent for him and declared  to him his intention to invest him with that charge. Abt Ja’far refused, as he  had done on a previous occasion, and begged to be left in private life, but on Abi  Sa’id insisting strongly he was compelled to accept it. However, he did not  exercise his functions long. As he was one day entertaining a party of friends at  his house, the conversation, amidst wine and mirth, turned upon hunting, a pastime  of which Abi Ja’far was passionately fond ; a party was accordingly arranged for  the next day, and, having provided themselves with all necessaries, Abi Ja’far and  his friends started on their expedition. It happened to be a very cold and cloudy  day, and, the cold increasing, the hunters thought fit to shelter themselves in the  hut of a watchman who was guarding vines.’ They lighted a good fire, dressed  some of their game, and began to eat with good appetite, and drink abundantly  after it. Abi Ja’far especially helped himself to so much liquor that he was quite  intoxicated, and putting aside all reserve he began to divulge the secrets of his  heart, and to describe the pleasures he had enjoyed that day in the following  eloquent strain :   “This has been a day spent in pleasure and sport; a day in which the  ‘* atmosphere shone brightly, charged with the amber of the clouds ;—   “* A day which (after contributing to our amusement) left us enough evening  “and sufficient wine to induce us to spend it in the midst of revelling and  “ mirth.   ** After riding and sporting all the morning we perceived that the day was  “ not entirely gone, and yet we were all fatigued and broken down by the  “ jolting trot of our steeds.   “‘ Our sport too had been abundant, for with grey-coloured hawks we chased  “and brought down numerous birds, whose death our pleasures required,  “ although their throats might lament under the knife.     CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 165    “« So when the last rays of the sun ‘began to spread a deep red tint over the  “ horizon, and the fight between obscurity and light commenced, victory  “ hanging for some time uncertain,—when every man and beast belonging to  ‘‘ our party had been assembled,—   “‘ Wishing to give our empty stomachs a share in the spoil, and to begin   afterwards a new chase of mirth and pleasure,—the cold, too, increasing and   “ becoming more and more piercing,—   “We bent our steps to the hut of a watchman, placed in the centre of a   vineyard and surrounded by its sweetness, and provided with a blazing fire,   which proved our salvation from the rigour of the weather.   “‘ 1 gave him a gold piece, and told him,—Go to the neighbouring village   “ and buy us provisions, heed not the price,   ‘* And say to the seller that thou hast seen me tied down in the service of   my master, more cruelly than the bird in the cage of the fowler.   “ And yet I only follow my inclination. Do I look like one who is subject  “to a Lord? do I look like one who is deprived of liberty ?” !   There happened to be among the company a man who, although he professed to  be Abii Ja’far’s friend, was, nevertheless, his secret enemy, and who, learning by  heart the last two verses, went the next day to the governor and repeated them to  him. Abd Sa’id immediately removed Abi Ja’far from his place, and conferred it  on another learned man. Things, however, did not stop there: Abd Ja’far having  once said to Hafsah the poetess, ‘‘ Do not love that black man, and I engage to buy  “thee ten better than he in the black slave-market,” meaning the governor, who  was of so dark a complexion as almost to resemble a negro, the words were again  reported to Abii Sa’id, who, however much he might have resented the outrage,  did not at first give vent to his passion, but concealed it in his heart, waiting  for a favourable opportunity. This, however, soon presented itself, for Abi  Ja’far’s brother, ’Abdu-r-rahman, son of ’Abdu-l-mdlik Ibn Sa’id, having taken  part with the rebels, and quitted Granada in order to join the troops under the  command of Ibn Mardanish, who had been proclaimed in the east of Andalus,  Abi Ja’far was arrested by the governor’s orders, thrown into a dungeon, and soon  afterwards beheaded at Malaga, then the place of his residence. But to return to  our account of the Andalusian poetesses.   Another poetess named Hafsah, daughter of Hamdtin, and a native of Guada-  laxara, is mentioned by Ibnu Sa’id among his illustrious characters of the fourth  century of the Hijra. She is also much praised by Ibnu-l-abbar, who sets her  down as a very clever poetess, and by Ibn Faraj, the author of the Al-haddyik'”  (orchards), who quotes some of her verses.    7     166 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK 11.    Zeynab Al-murabiyyah,"" and Hamdah, whom others call Hamdtinah, were the  daughters of Zeydd, a native of Guadix. They are mentioned by several authors,  as Al-malahi, Abi-l-k4sim, Al-bardk, and others. Ibnu Sa’id says that they were  born at Granada, but agrees with the former writers in fixing the city of Guadix as  their residence. Both were famous for their wit, their literary accomplishments,  and their talents for poetry. The former, especially, was deeply versed in various  branches of literature ; she wrote and copied many works, which, in the opinion of  Tbnu Sa’id, who says he saw some of them, were written in a masterly style.  Zeynab died in the year four hundred of the Hijra; she never would consent to be  married, although she had numerous proposals. She lived for some time at  Cordova, where she used to frequent the house of Al-mudhfer, son of Al-mansir Ibn  Abi ’A’mir, in whose praise she composed several verses.   Mariam,""? daughter of Abii Ya’kib Al-ansari, inhabited Seville, of which place she  was a native, although other writers say that the city of Silves was the place of her  birth. Ibn Dih’yah, who mentions her in his Al-muttreb, says that she was a learned  and very accomplished woman, and that she taught rhetoric, poetry, and literature,  which, united to her piety, her good morals, her virtues, and amiable disposition,  gained her the affection of her sex, and gave her many pupils; she lived to an old  age, and died after the year four hundred of the Hijra. Al-homaydi has likewise  given an account of this poetess, and quoted some of her verses.   Asma Al-’4meriyyah was also a native of Seville, where she resided and made  herself conspicuous among the learned by her talents. She addressed to ’Abdu-l-  mimen Ibn ’Ali a risdleh, in which, after stating minutely her genealogy, and her  claims to a descent from Ibn Abi ’A’mir, she proceeded to beg the favour of being  exempt from the payment of taxes, and having soldiers quartered upon her. There  was at the end of the risdleh an ode which began thus :   “O Prince of the believers! O our magnificent Lord! we wish thee  “« prosperity. May the Almighty give victory to thy arms!   ‘“‘ When we rise to the superior regions of tradition, thy name and thy acts  “are the surest path to them.” 15   Ummu-I-hiné, daughter of the Kadi Abi Mohammed ’Abdu-I-hakk Ibn ’Attiyyah,""""  learnt divinity from her father, and was, besides, an excellent poetess. She lived at  Almeria, and wrote several works on the mode of worshipping the Almighty.   Hind, a slave girl of Abi Mohammed ’Abdullah Ibn Moslemah Ash-shatebi (a  native of Xdtiva), is said to have excelled in poetry, music, and the lighter branches  of literature. It is related of Abi ’A’mir Ibn Yank,""® that wishing once to hear  Hind perform on the lute he addressed her in the following two verses, begging her  to come to his house :     CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 167    “ O Hind, dost thou feel any impediment in coming to me? palm wine is  “ forbidden, ’tis true, but not the drinking of limpid waters.   “ The nightingale, after hearing thy performance, envies thee, and wishes to  ‘* hear again the deep intonations of thy lute.” '   To which Hind replied, on the back of the letter,   ““O my Lord! may the Almighty prosper thee, and increase thy power  ‘ and importance !   “It is my intention to hasten to thy presence, and to be in my own person  “* the bearer of my answer.” ""7   Ash-shelbiyyah is mentioned by Ibnu-l-abbér, who says, “‘ I do not recollect now  ‘‘ what her name was, Ash-shelbiyyah ""* being only her patronymic. All I know is  “that she was a very good poetess, as may be gathered from her writings, and  “especially from an epistle in verse which she addressed to the Sultén Ya’kib  “ Al-mansir, complaining of a certain governor and collector of taxes in the city  “ where she resided.”   Nazhiin ""° the Granadian is described by Ibnu Sa’id, who places her among the  illustrious characters of the fifth century. She is likewise mentioned by Al-hijari,  who portrays her in his Al-mas‘hab as a female endowed with great tenderness of  soul, and a very mild disposition; extraordinary talents for poetry, and a most  wonderful memory. She wrote several poems, and made herself famous by the  beauty and happiness of her similes.   Bahjah, a native of Cordova, and a friend of the famous Walddah, was equally  renowned for her beauty and for her verses. She lived in great intimacy with  Waladah,'* the daughter of Al-mustakfi, King of Cordova, and profited by her  lessons. But of this Wal4dah, who was herself the most eminent poetess of her  time, as well as of Ramikiyyah, Imad, Al-’abb4diyyah, and Buthinah, the three  former wives, and the latter a daughter, of Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbdd, King of  Seville, more will be said in the course of our. narrative.   Having clearly shown the aptitude and talents of the inhabitants of Andalus, we  shall now proceed in the next chapter to give, in the words of the historian Ibnu  Sa’id, as faithful a sketch as we can of the productions of Andalusian genius in  every department of science.",book_2,chapter_3

Wuar follows is transcribed word for word from Ibnu Sa’id. ‘‘ I deem it oppor-  “ tune,” says that accurate historian, ‘to give here an epistle written by Abi  ‘* Mohammed Ibn Hazm the Héfedh, in which he records some of the excellences  “* of the learned of Andalus. The occasion of his writing the said epistle was as  “ follows. Abi ’Ali Al-hasan Ibn Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibn Ar-rabib At-temimi  “ Al-cairwéni once wrote to Abi-l-mugheyrah ’Abdu-l-wahhéb Ibn Ahmed Ibn  “‘*Abdi-r-rahmén Ibn Hazm an epistle in which he stated that the Andalusians  were negligent in perpetuating the history of their country, the memory of their  doctors, the virtues of their theologians, and the praiseworthy actions of their  kings. The epistle ran thus :   “*O our Lord! O thou most beloved among our intimate friends! may the  Almighty God write down for thee prosperity and happiness! may He continue  thee in power and command! may He help and assist thee, put thee in the right  path whenever thou askest for direction, and enlighten thee whenever thou wishest  “ to be instructed !   «The object of this our letter is that we some time ago began to think about  thy country, and to consider how it was the abode of every excellence, the store  of every good thing, the‘ resort of every novelty, and the meeting-place of every  advantage ; the end of the hopes of the desirous, and the scope of the wishes of  the inquiring; the great emporium of trade, where every merchandize found a  purchaser, and every buyer the object of his wishes. All this we knew to be the  case with thy country; we knew also that the above-mentioned were not the     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 169    “ only advantages which thy native land could boast of, for it possessed many others,  “ such as the vast number of its learned men, the multitude of its authors, the shining  “ virtues of its Kings, and their laudable practices in the encouragement of science ;  “their esteem for those who cultivated it, their honouring those whom science  “ honoured, and their extolling those whom learning extolled: nor was this confined  “only to science, for the same conduct was observed by them towards military  “men, distinguishing and raising in command those whom their valour and military  “knowledge placed above others, and honouring those whom their intrepidity in  “ battle made honourable. By these means the coward became brave, the timid was  “‘ made bold,—the obscure, conspicuous,—the ignorant, learned,—the stammerer,  “ eloquent,—the inarticulate crier, a poet. The Bogdth' strove to imitate the eagle  “ in his flight, bats were enabled to see? by daylight, men gave their entire attention  “to the cultivation of science, and the arts flourished through the general efforts  “employed in them. All this we know to be true, but at the same time it must be  “ owned that your literary men are guilty of unpardonable negligence, and unac-  “ countable indolence, in perpetuating the records of their country ; since, instead of  “collecting the excellences and advantages of their respective towns,—instead of  “ perpetuating in their books the memory of their cities, and transmitting to posterity  “the actions of their Kings and Princes, Kétibs and Wizirs, Kddis and Ulemas,—  “ instead of leaving behind them accounts which might preserve for ever afterwards  “ the fame of their deeds, and eternize and renew their names through the lapse of  “ ages, and the course of nights and days,—instead of composing books which, like  “ the tongue of truth, might herald their virtues to future generations through the  “succession of time,—they leave every merit and virtue in the most complete state  “of oblivion. Yes, truth must be told ; although we admit that your learned men  “ shine like so many bright stars in the sciences, thou must own that every thing  “ belonging to them remains in the shade, does not come before the public, stands  “firm on its pivot, and never goes astray. If they write a book, they are afraid of  “ being criticised or impugned ; and if they compile a work, they dare not show it,  “lest people should be of a contrary opinion to their own ; so that they never do  “* write, or, if they do, it is as if they were carried off by the birds, or blown away  “by the winds to an enormous distance.? Not one among them pays the least  “* attention, or employs himself for one moment, in collecting the merits of his coun-  “ trymen, or suffers his attention to rest on the brilliant qualities of former Sulténs.  “ None will dip his pen to commemorate the actions of their Katibs and Wizirs, or  “ blot a sheet of paper with the virtuous deeds of their KAdis and Ulemas ; and yet,  “‘ were they to let loose the padlocks of their mouths, and untie the bonds that  VOL.

Such is  ‘* not the case with learned people of other countries, for by perpetuating their records  “ they give to each author that share of celebrity to which he is justly entitled, and  “ they write books by which they raise everlasting monuments to their fame. And  “ if thou pretend to say that the same negligence of which we accuse the authors of  ‘‘ thy country is to be found among those of ours, and that they also produce works  ‘‘ which never reach the notice of the public, we will answer thee that the assertion  ‘is not a true one ; for this country being only separated from thine by an evening’s  “« gail, or as it were by a short march, if the wind were to blow to our shores the  “fame of your authors, or to carry hither the name of their writings, there is no  ‘doubt but that the voice would be listened to by the dead in their tombs, not to  “* speak of those who are living in houses and palaces; and they would graciously  “‘ admit their performance, in the same manner as they received the collection of  “* poems by Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-r-rabbihi which he entitled Al-’ikd, although, if truth  “be told, he is somewhat to be blamed for not having made the excellences of his  “ country the chief topic of his book, and the noble actions of Kings the principal  “« jewel in his necklace,® for not having redoubled his efforts, and given all his  ** diligence to the inquiry, but having, on the contrary, strained every nerve, and  “* put in motion every joint, to produce—what ?—a sword without edge; and to do  «‘ what ?—what his friends and companions had done before him: that is, to pass  “ over in silence that which might concern them, and neglect to mention that which  ‘* was most important, and might make them appear greater in the eyes of the world.  “ This is all we have to say ; now, if thou shouldst have any thing to reply, if thou  “ shouldst have any good reasons to state in return, or have in thy hands the means  “ of solving this difficulty, pray acquaint us with it.

The letter even goes so far as to describe us as  “not having among us authors in the different sciences whose writings exist, and  “ whose fame is transmitted to posterity; for we are told that the moment these  “authors die their writings are forgotten, and their learning buried along with  “them ; and certainly, if what the writer of the letter tells us himself be true, it  “ cannot be otherwise, for he informs us that the very moment any work of merit  “ appears among us it is taken to Africa, and we become the object of continual  “ visitation, and the aim of the repeated attacks of the learned on the opposite shore.   “ « However, it was at a meeting crowded with all sorts of polite learning, and  “ta sitting abounding in all kinds of science, at a palace inhabited by every ex-  “cellence, and a dwelling full of every description of elegance,—overflowing  “with the subtilties of thought and the brilliant bursts of the imagination ;—a  “house which is the abode of honour and glory, the repository of dignity and  “ command, the halting-place and refuge of travellers struck with fear, and the  “ meeting-place of the staffs of peregrination ; the habitation, in fine, of the illus-  “ trious, honourable, and highly respected Kaid, Abi ’Abdillah Kasim, Lord    Tbn Hazm’s  reply.

For although I am aware that many doctors  “have disputed the interpretation given to the said prophecy, and will continue to  “do so, and are of opinion that the Prophet meant perhaps by it either the island  “ of Sicily or that of Akritis (Crete), although I know the objection will be raised  “that there is no sufficient proof of what I advance, namely, that the Prophet  “ meant by his words Andalus and no other country, and that early traditions like  “this ought not to be admitted and adopted by prudent people unless they be  “accompanied by manifest and convincing evidence, quite disengaged from the  “ ambiguities of language, and resting upon the testimony of good and honourable  “witnesses ; I, nevertheless, persist in giving to the prophecy the aforesaid in-  “ terpretation, as the proofs, in my opinion, are conclusive. I state them, trusting  “in God, whose help and assistance I implore.   “* Tt is well known to every Moslem how our Lord Mohammed was endowed with  “the comprehensiveness of speech and the cream of delivery, and how God  “ Almighty permitted that whatever was revealed to him should be communicated  “with the tongue of eloquence. It is likewise a matter of fact that a tradition  “authenticated and handed down from witness to witness is in existence, purporting  “that the Prophet said once, ‘ that two bands from among his people would furrow  “ the spray of the seas, and make conquest after conquest,’ and that Ummu-l-haram  “having asked him to beseech his Lord, the Almighty God, to make her one of  “the number, he then announced to her that she would be one of the first con-  “ querors ; and so she was, for she joined the naval expedition against Cyprus,  “landed, fought on her mule, and died some time afterwards in the island, (may  “God forgive her!) And certainly no other proof can be required of our Lord  “ Mohammed’s prophetic mission than this acquaintance with and prediction of  “events before they happened. Now this conquest of Cyprus being the first naval     174 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    ‘ expedition in which the Moslems were engaged, it becomes evident that the  ‘‘ warriors who subdued that island, and planted in it the banners of Isl4m, were  ‘the same whom the Lord’s messenger designated in his prophecy by that word  “ al-awalin (the first conquerors), and that Ummu-l-hardm being in their number,  “‘ as the Prophet had predicted, she was entitled to be counted among the first con-  ‘* querors. From the above-mentioned fact I draw an inference which admits of no  ** contradiction ; for, owing to the eloquence and perspicuity of speech with which the  “‘ Prophet was gifted by the Almighty, it must be concluded that when he men-  “ tioned two different bands of his people, one of which he specified by calling it  “ the first, there must necessarily follow another called the second. This is, indeed,  ‘a question which appertains to the rules of grammar, the construction of nouns,  “‘ with their relatives, and the syntax of numbers, for it is an imperious rule of  “logic that a second should follow the first ; since the first is not the first but with  “ relation to a second, nor the second such but with relation to a first, although the  “ third need not be mentioned unless it be particularly required by the second. So  “‘ when our Prophet (the Lord’s benediction and salutation be upon him!) an-  “nounced two bands of his people, and foretold two naval expeditions, one of  “which was called by him al-awalin (that of the first conquerors), that word  “must necessarily indicate the existence of another band called akharin (the  “ others), and who with relation to the first would have been the second. And  “‘ these are the people whom the Prophet announced would be the best of men,  “ after the men of his own age, and the first of mankind in virtue and excellence,  “as well as in upholding the tenets of the religion revealed by him who is, and  “* will for ever be, the best of men.   “ «This point once established, I may easily prove that the conquerors of Andalus  ‘were mentioned in the prophecy, since this country was the next which the  “Moslems attacked by sea, the naval expedition directed against Constantinople,  “‘ and which was commanded by Hobeyrah Al-fazéri, not having taken place until  “ the reign of Suleyman Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek.””   “« © As to the island of Sicily, it was not conquered until the year 212 of the Hijra  “ (a.p. 827-8), in the first days of the reign of the Beni Aghlab, the expedition  “ sailing from Africa at the command of Asad Ibnu-l-forét Al-kédi, the friend ’® of  “* Abd Yusuf, who lived and died in the island.   ‘« «Crete was never subdued by the Moslems until the year 203 of the Hijra  “* (a.p. 818-9), when Abi Hafs Omar Ibn Sho’ayb, better known by the surname  “ of Ibnu-l-ghalith, a native of Betréh (Petroche), in the district of Fahsu-l-bolitt,  “ near Cordova, attacked and conquered it at the head of an army of Cordovans,  “whom the Sult4n Al-hakem had, after a rebellion, fought in several battles, and     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 175    “‘ ultimately expelled from his capital.'° The throne of the island remained for  “‘ many years in the hands of the posterity of Ibnu-l-ghalith, until, under the reign  “of the last prince of his dynasty, named ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibnu Sho’ayb, it was  “* attacked and reduced by Romanus,” son of Constantine, emperor of the Greeks,  “in the year 350 of the Hijra (a.p. 961-2).   “« «In what respects the division of climates, Cordova, the place of my birth and  “« the scene of my youth, is placed in the same climate with the city of Sarra men  “« rai ;™ we are therefore endowed with intelligence and acuteness of mind, which fall  “ to the lot of the inhabitants of the fifth climate; and although the planets come  “ to us only at their setting, after their rising in other countries, a circumstance  “which, in the opinion of those who are versed in the science of the influence of  “* the stars over the human body, is rather a proof against the intellectual faculties  “‘ of the inhabitants, yet this country has produced men who have left in the  ‘* sciences as brilliant traces as those of most other countries. On the other hand,  “ the elevation of one of her planets ninety degrees is a proof of the aptitude of her  “inhabitants for the sciences, and their high qualifications for them. This is  “ indeed become manifest, and may be proved by several instances, for the Anda-  “ lusians have always shown the greatest aptitude for the theological sciences, such  “as the reading and expounding of the Koran, tradition and canonical juris-  “ prudence; they have exhibited the greatest subtilty and talent in grammar,  “poetry, rhetoric, philology, history, medicine, arithmetic, astrology,—leaving in  “every one of the said branches important works.   “© As to the imputation which the writer of the letter casts upon the learned of  “this country, namely, that they are guilty of neglecting to preserve the names,  “ birth-places, and genealogies, of the individuals who have distinguished themselves  “by their acquirements in certain branches of learning, my answer is, that if the  “ charge preferred against us be as stated, then the same reproach is to be addressed  “to most countries, and to most principal cities and large provinces. So, for  ‘instance, to begin with Cairwan, the birth-place of the writer who accuses us,  “IT do not recollect having read any history of that city, save the account contained  ‘in the book entitled Kitabu-l-mwarrab ft akhbdri-l-maghrebi® (the book of the  “ speaker according to the rules of Arabic grammar on the history of the West),  “and with the exception of what may be found in the works of Mohammed Ibn  “ Yusuf Al-warrak,2> who, as is well known, wrote for Al-mustanser-billah (whom  “may God forgive !) several books on the routes and kingdoms of Africa, on the  “history of its Kings, and their wars with those who rose against them. The same  “author wrote also the history of several African cities, as Tahart,* Wahran  “ (Oran), Tiinis, Sigilmdsah,* Nakir,% Basrah,”” describing the manners and     176 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK 11.    ** customs of their inhabitants; all works of the greatest learning and merit. It  ‘“‘ must be stated that this Mohammed was an Andalusian by origin and by birth ;  “‘ his parents were born at Guadalaxara, and he came to settle in Cordova, where  “he lived and died, and is buried. Had he been born in Cairwdn no doubt he  ‘* would have been adduced as a testimony against what I am endeavouring to  ‘* prove, but, I repeat, he was a native of Guadalaxara, and domiciliated in Cordova.  “* But it being my intention to enter at full length into the subject, and to investi-  “ gate thoroughly the question raised by thee, I shall, with God’s favour, proceed  “‘ to state my arguments.   “It is well known that our most illustrious historians among our ancestors, as  ‘* well as among our contemporaries, without one single exception, all, on the  “ contrary, agreeing with me on the subject, have constantly designated authors  “and other learned men by the patronymic of the country of their residence,  “ provided they did not quit it to travel to other lands, but settled and lived in it  ‘“ until the time of their death ; so, for instance, when our historians or traditionists  “ mention those among the companions of the Prophet who are distinguished by  “ the patronymic surname of Kifiyyin, they will put at the head ’Ali Ibn Abi Télib,  “ Tbn Mas’tid,”® and Khodheyfah.” ’Ali only lived at Kiifah for five years and  ‘* some months, and although he had passed fifty-eight years and months of his  “ life both at Mekka and at Medina, (may God preserve them both!) and had  “« distinguished himself in both those cities, he is placed among the people of  “Kiifah. The same might be said of the two other less illustrious companions  “above mentioned. When they mention the people of Basrah they will begin with  “?*Ammar Ibn Hassin,2® and Ans Ibn Maélik; Hish4m Ibn ’A’mir,?' and Abi  “ Bekrah ;*? although every one of these distinguished individuals was born, had  “* resided, and spent most of his life in the Hejjaz, or in Tehémeh, or in the Tayef,®  “ his residence in the city whence his name is derived having been but insignificant  ‘« compared with the time he had spent in other countries. The same might be said  * of the Shamiyyiin (natives of Damascus) ; they will put the first in the list Ibadah  “ Tbnu-s-sdmah,* Abi-l-dirh4,® Abi ’Obeydah Ibnu-l-jarrah,* Mo’adh,3”7 Mu’a-  ‘* wiyah,>* and others, who are in the same circumstances as the above-mentioned,  “* not having been born nor having resided any length of time in the city of Damascus,  “‘ whence their patronymics are derived. They will count among the Misriyyin  “ (natives of Cairo) ’Amru Ibnu-l-’4ss, and Kharijah Ibn Khod4fah® Al-’abduwi,  “ and among the Mekiyyin (natives of Mekka) ’Abdullah Ibn ’Abb4s,“ and ’Ab-  ‘“‘ dullah Ibn Zobeyr,*! who are precisely in the same case as the above-described.  “ Now those among the learned who at different times have come to settle among  ‘* us we have always treated with justice, since they are held by us in the estimation     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 177    “ which their merits deserve, and named after the countries where they were born.  “ They have, it is true, against them all those who do not approve of their doctrines,  “but at the same time they have in their favour all their disciples, who take care to  “ preserve and hand down to posterity every particular respecting their ancestors,  “ birth-places, number of works they wrote, and so forth. But does the same thing  “happen with such among our countrymen as happen to quit this land and settle  “in foreign countries? No,—on the contrary, whenever any of our learned  “leave this their native country to settle in distant lands, no trace whatever is  “ left of them, (may they be happy in the places of their residence!) I shall not,  “therefore, lay claim to Isma’il Ibnu-l-k4sim,*? neither shall we dispute about  “Mohammed Ibn Hani,* unless we put justice above all things, for justice is the  “thing I mostly aim at and desire; and my judgments,—independent of the  “ respective merits of each author (which are not for the present moment) ,—shall  “ be delivered with the greatest impartiality.   “ «But to return to my arguments in favour of my proposition, namely, that the  “earned of other great cities have not been so anxious as they are described in  “collecting and preserving the traditions of their native countries. Baghdéd is  “ certainly the capital of the world, and the mine of every excellence ; it is the city  “whose inhabitants have always been the first to unfurl the banners of knowledge,  “and to raise the standard of science; indeed their subtilty in all branches of  “learning, their gentle manners and amiable disposition, noble bearing, acuteness,  “wit, penetration, and talent, are deservedly praised. Basrah is the spring whence  “all the qualities above mentioned flow to the rest of the world, and yet I know of  “no other work on the history of this former city than that of Ahmed Ibn Abi  “Téhir ;* for although there are other works written by literary men born in that  “city, none that I know has made the history of Baghd4d the chief topic of his  “book. Neither do I know of any works descriptive of Basrah than that of Omar  “Ton Shabah, and that of a man of the tribe of Ar-rabi’, son of Zeyéd,** and  “dedicated to Abi Sufién, which treats upon the topography and divisions of  “that city, and two more works by two of its inhabitants,—one of whom was  “named ’Abdu-l-kéhir, and bore the patronymic surname of Al-kizi,—giving a  “ description of the markets, streets, inns, and so forth, of Basrah. On the history  “ of Kiifah I know of no other work than that of ""Omar Ibn Abi Sheybah ;* and as  “to the countries of Al-jebél, Khorass4n, Tabaristan, Jorjan, Karman, Sejestan,  “and Sind, Rey, Armenia, Adhrabjjin, and many other populous and extensive  “ provinces, I must own that I never saw, in the whole course of my life, one  “single work in which the history of those countries, the good actions of their  “kings, and the talents of their ulemas, poets, and physicians, were satisfactorily   VOL. I. . 2a     178 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    “treated of. In the mean-while, the people of this country were wishing most  “ vehemently for a work that should contain a biographical account of the theo-  “logians of Baghddd, for all we know about them is that they were eminent for  “ their learning, highly praised for their virtues, and much honoured and respected  ‘‘ for their works: had a work on the subject been published, certainly it would  “have reached us, as that of Hamzah Ibnu-l-hasan Al-isfah4ni‘’ on the history  ‘‘ of Isfahén, and that of Al-maussili*® on the history of Maussil (Mosul), and  “‘ many others on the history of Cairo that have been received and read in this  “ country; in the same manner as we have become acquainted with various works  “ written by foreign ‘literati on the different departments of science,—such as the  “ book of Abi-l-’abb4s Mohammed Ibn ’Abdiin Al-cairwéni, being a commentary  ‘ on civil law, and an exposition of the doctrines of the Im4m Shéfa’f,—such as the  ‘* critique which the Kadi Ahmed Ibn Talib At-temimi® wrote against Abi  “ Hanfifeh, and those who followed his sect,—such as the works of Ibn ’Abdits,""!  “and Mohammed Ibn Sahniin,®? and other useful books, which, nevertheless, have  ** not acquired great celebrity for their authors.   “ «In what respects this country I must own that nowhere is that universal  “ proverb, ‘Man always shuns the knowledge of his own people,’ ** so applicable  ‘“‘as it is among us; and, as I recollect having read in the book of the gospels,  ** Jesus (on whom be peace!) said, ‘the Prophet shall not be destitute of honour,  “or protection, but in his own country :’™ nothing is more true, and the saying  “* can be tested by what happened to our own glorious Prophet with the Koray-  “ shites, who, notwithstanding their mild disposition and gentle manners, their  “extreme forbearance, their quick intelligence, their veracity and honour, and  ‘‘many other qualities in which they surpassed every other people on earth,—  “ notwithstanding they had received from the Almighty the most fertile valleys,  “and the best-watered meadows for their habitation,—notwithstanding God had  “« distinguished Aus and Al-khazraj** by gifts which made them the most eminent  “‘ of mankind,—treated the Prophet as is well known. God, indeed, gives to each  “race of men and to every country as he pleases ; and it has fallen to the lot of  “the inhabitants of this country to be the most envious of men towards people  ‘‘ who show learning, or who exhibit talents, or gain fame in any art or profession  ‘‘ whatever. So, for instance, the Andalusians will always depreciate the works  “ brought before them, they will find fault with the best passages, while they will  ‘* praise and extol those that abound with errors, or are written in a mean and  “* defective style ; their envy and ill-will towards the author will last as long as he  ‘* lives, and be double of what it is in other countries: if an author acquire fame  “by his writings, they will say that he is a literary thief, a plagiarist, a man who     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 179    “ attributes to himself the writings of another, or who pretends to what he has no  “right to; if the author only reach mediocrity, they will say that his writings are  “ devoid of sense, his plan bad, his narrative cold and ill-arranged, his style mean  “and defective ; if the author, on the contrary, show by his writings that he will  “ collect in time the spears of preference, they will say, with an air of patronage,—  “When was that? Where did he learn? Whose lessons did he receive? Is he  “an orphan ?—If fate then allow him to enter one of the two ordinary ‘paths of  “ literature, namely, the most frequented and open, or the solitary and deserted,  “if he follow the former they will praise him and extol him above his equals, but  “if he happen to take the latter, to leave the trodden paths and to introduce the  “ least innovation, then begins the fray against the poor author ;** he becomes a  “mark for the sayings of envious people, and an object for the attacks of the  “designing, a stumbling-block for those who are inclined to satire, a prey to the  “ slanderers, and an obstacle in the way of those who wish to travel towards him.  “He will at times be attacked for words which he never uttered, or assailed for  “sentences which he never wrote ; he will be arraigned for opinions which he never  “ entertained,’ and charged with things he never dreamt of. The animosity  “ against him will increase if he happen to be forward in the line he pursues, or if  “he is not sufficiently regarded by his sovereign, or placed in such a position near  “the Sultan as may ensure him from the attacks of his opponents, and the shafts  “of his envious adversaries; for if he venture upon composing a book he will be  “ defamed, opposed, and bitterly criticised ; whatever errors he may have committed  “ will be magnified and exaggerated, his good points will be passed over in silence, his  “ merits will be concealed as with a veil, while he will be continually twitted with  “such things as escaped him, or what he did without proper care and attention :  “the consequence of all this being that the poor author is worried to death, that  “his talents and imagination are sadly impaired by it, that his spirits are broken  “down, and his ardour damped. And do not imagine that I am overcharging the  “ picture, for what I have just related is the true sketch of what is passing every  “ day among us; and whoever undertakes to write a poem, or to compose a risdleh,  “is sure to fall into the circumventing nets that I have just described to thee,  “and to be entangled in their inextricable knots,—nets which will be escaped by him  “ only who has sense enough to foresee the danger, or sufficient courage to face it,  “or who makes himself superior to what may be said or thought of him. This is  “the way in which works of the greatest merit have been produced among us,  “and in such numbers that the readers will think they exceed those of any other  “country. I proceed to mention a few.  “In this branch we possess many first-rate works, such as the Kitdbu-l-heddyeh © presence.     Works on the  sect of Malik.    Commentaries  on the Koran.    180 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    “* (the book of direction), written by “Isa Ibn Dindr, which is composed of four  “* parts, the whole collected according to the opinions of Malik and Ibn Kasim.”   ** « Another is the Kitdbu-s-saldt © (the book of prayer) ; the Kitdbu-I-buyu’i (the  “book of buying and selling); the Kitdbu-ljiddr ft-l-ak’dhiyd (the book of  “‘ foundations of the law); and the Kitdbu-n-nakdhi wa-t-taldki (the book of  ‘* matrimony and divorce).   “ « As to works on the sect of Malik, they abound among us. I may quote among  “* others that of the K4di Malik Ibn ’Ali, who was a noble Arab of the tribe of  “ Koraysh, of the branch of the Beni Fehr, and who travelled to the East, where he  ‘* met with the disciples of Malik, and the disciples of his disciples: his work is an  ‘ excellent composition, full of wonderful anecdotes, and abounding with other  “ useful and instructive matter, such as letters, dates respecting the birth and death  “ of illustrious men, and so forth. Of the same kind is the work of Abi Ishak  “« Tbréhim Ibn Mazin, being a commentary on the Mowatté of Malik,“ and other  ‘* works by the same author, in which he not only paid the utmost attention to the  ‘* interpretation of all obscure words in the said book, but likewise collected and  ‘* put together all the information scattered through it. We have by the same  ‘* author a biographical dictionary of all the doctors mentioned in the Mowattd, with  ‘an account of the traditional sayings which Malik held from each of them.   ‘« «Commentaries on the Kordn are likewise numerous. I shall only mention here  “that of Abi ’Abdi-r-rahm4n Baki-bn-Mokhlid,® which is written with so much  “« perfection that I do not hesitate to say that the like of it was never composed in  “ any of the countries subject to the rule of Islam ; and that neither the celebrated  “ commentary by Ibn Jarir At-tabari, nor those of other famous writers, can be  “* compared to it. Abd ’Abdi-r-rahman is likewise the author of a voluminous work  “* on sacred traditions, made in the form of a dictionary, in the following manner :—  “ he first of all arranged alphabetically the names of the companions of the Prophet,  ‘ (may the Lord’s favour be with them !) he then disposed the traditions delivered  “‘ by each companion according to the initial letters of the different heads of juris-  “* prudence and the chapters of judicial decisions, quoting traditions from upwards of  “ one thousand three hundred authors. As a collection of traditional jurisprudence I  “ know of no other better than this, nor do I know of any writer who followed this  “« plan before, or who executed his task in a manner so highly deserving of praise, and  “« entitled to so much confidence, or who commanded so much attention and respect  ** by his grave and sound reasoning, by the variety and judicious selection of his tra-  “« ditional anecdotes, and the purity of the springs at which he drank ; for he quotes  “ from the mouth of upwards of two hundred and eighty-four doctors, among whom  “ not one-tenth were of an inferior class, while all the rest were men well known for     CHAP. IVv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 181    “their learning and their works. Nor were these the only performances of this  “ distinguished writer ; he composed besides several works on the excellences of the  “ gs‘hdb (companions) and tdbi’s (followers) of the Prophet, and other eminent men not  “ belonging to either of the above-mentioned classes, which very much increase our  “ stock of information derived from the work of Abi Bekr Ibn Abi Sheybah, and  “that of ’Abdu-r-razz4k Ibn Hamdm,® and that of Sa’id Ibn Mansir™ and  “others. The said writer, as well in this as in his other works, displayed the most  “profound learning, and an erudition which no author before him ever showed :  “ the works of this illustrious Im4m became the foundations of Islam, and I may  “ confidently assert that nothing equal to them was ever written. In private life he  “was a most excellent and virtuous man ; he never would accept any public office,  “and was the intimate friend of Ahmed Ibn Hanbal, (may God show him mercy !)   “Qn the legal decisions contained in the Koran we possess the Ahkdmu-l-kordn Legal decisions  “ (decisions of the Korén), a work by Abii Umeyyah Al-hijéri,* who followed the Korén.  “sect of Shafa’i, and wrote in a pure and elegant style: that of the Kadi Abi-l-   . “hakem Mundhir Ibn Sa’id,* who followed the sect of Déid,” and was one of  “his warmest supporters, and wrote a most eloquent and ingenious defence of it.  “ Both the works of these authors on the legal decisions founded on the Koran are  “ really invaluable. Besides the above-mentioned, Mundhir composed other works,  “as the Kitdbu-l-abdnati min hakdyiki osili-d-diydnati (the book of demonstration  “ of the true principles of religious observances).   “* Inthe department of traditions I can quote the work of Abi Mohammed Kasim oer  “Tbn Asbagh Ibn Yusuf Ibn Nassij, as also that of Mohammed Ibn ’Abdi-l-mélik ,  “Tbn Aymen, both of which are compositions of the greatest merit, and contain a  “ greater number of traditional stories, and wonderful anecdotes, than any other  “work which has yet come to my hands. The former of those doctors is likewise  “known as the author of several works which are held in great estimation ; as  “for instance the Kitdb ahkdmi-l-kordn (the book on the decisions of the Koran),  “ following the chapters and divisions of the book of Isma’il,®° and the very sense  “of his words ; Kitdbu-l-mujtant” (the book of the gathering), being a work on  “the same subject, disposed in the same form as that of Ibnu-l-jérdd entitled  “ Kitdbu-l-muntakt™ (the book of selections), to which it is considered far superior,  “not only as containing a greater number of well authenticated traditions and  “ precious allegations, but because it abounds with useful and important learning in  “other matters. Another of the same kind is the Kitdb ft fadhdyili Korayshi wa  “ Kandnati (the book on the excellency of the tribes of Koraysh and Kananah),’?  “and the Kitdb ft-n-ndsikh wa-l-mansikh (the book on the copy and the original) ;”3     182 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    “ and the ‘ book of the wonders of traditions preserved by Malik, and which are not  “in his Mowattd’ (Kitdb ghardyibi-l-hadithi Maliki mimmd leysa ft-l-mowattd).   “« « Another work on the subject is that written under the title of At-tamhid (the  “ book of levelling) by our excellent friend Abi Omar Yisuf Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr, who  “ is now living, and still very far from old age, (may God delay the end of his life !)  “« Such a book as his was never composed in Arabic ; the style in which it is written,  “ and the respectability of the authorities consulted for it, make it highly commend-  “‘ able; indeed I cannot imagine how a better one could be written. An epitome of  “ the aforesaid work (At-tamhfd), entitled the ‘ book of the recollections’ (Kitdbu-l-  “« istidhkdri),”* is also counted among the works written by my friend, as likewise  “‘ many others equally valuable, and the like of which never were written. I shall  “ only mention his ‘ manual of legal decisions according to the school of Malik and  “ his disciples’ (Kitdbu-l-kdfiyu fi-L-fik’ hi wa-l-madW’hebi Mdlik wa as‘hdbihi),”> which  “« he has divided into fifteen books, and wherein he has introduced every thing that  “* was necessary and important for a Mufti to know, explaining every circumstance  “ with the greatest care and attention, thus making it a work that rendered unne-  ‘* cessary other great compilations on the subject. He also composed a work on  “the biography of the companions of the Prophet, which stands unrivalled by any  “« preceding author who has treated the subject, notwithstanding that many have  “ undertaken it.   “On the same topic we have a book, also the composition of Ibn ’Abdi-l-barr,”  “ entitled ‘sufficient rules on the method of reading the Koran, according to the  “* schools of Naf’ and Abi ’Amri, with proofs in favour of each system,’ and the  “ book called ‘ glory of the assemblies and delight of the assembled on the charming  “ verses and wonderful anecdotes which occur in the reading of the Koran and its  “* commentaries’ (Kitdb bahjati-l-mejdlisi wa anisi-l-mujdlist),”” and the book en-  ‘titled ‘repertory of science,’® and exposition of its advantages,’ being a manual  “ of what is necessary to be known in order to become a good traditionist.   “«Tcan also mention another work by our Sheikh the K4di Abi-l-walid ’Abdillah  ‘Tbn Mohammed Ibn Yiisuf, better known by the surname of Ibnu-l-faradhi,”? on  ‘the various modes of spelling proper names (Al-mokhtalef wa-l-mutalef ft asmdi-  ‘* r-rejdli), which is composed of thirty parts, or books, while the famous one  “by the Héfedh ’Abdu-l-ghani-l-basri,*"" on the same subject, has only two. In  “fact, I know no better work on this science.   Rineraphy af £6 As to the history of the companions of the Prophet, and other famous tradi-  wi the Hrophet, “ tionists, written by Ahmed Ibn Sa’fd,® I can only say that it is a work of the  “* greatest merit. The author followed an entirely new plan ; he disposed his names     cHAP.

Ahmed Ibn Sa’id is, moreover, deservedly put at the head of the authors  “ who have treated the subject.   “*The Kadi Mohammed Ibn Yahya Ibn Mufarraj™ is the author of several  “works in the same department of science. The principal are: a treatise divided  “ into seven books, in which he collected all that Al-hasan Al-basri® had written on  “ jurisprudence,*—a similar compilation of the writings of Az-zahri,®’—and other  “less elaborate works on the same subject. Of the same kind is a commentary on  “traditions by ’A’mir Ibn Khalf As-sarakosti (of Saragossa), which, in the opinion of  “ Abi ’Obeyd, was the most brilliant production of the age. As to the works which  “ the aforesaid writer composed on jurisprudence and the disciples of Malik, there is  “ but one opinion in this country ; they are held in great repute, and considered most  “accomplished performances : one of them, entitled Al-mustakhrdjatu mina-l-isma’ ti  “ (extracts from the hearing of lessons), better known by the title of Al-’otbiyyah,*  “is justly celebrated, and held in great estimation among the people of Africa.   “« Another work by Abi Omar Ahmed Ibn ’Abdi-]-mélik Ibn Hishdm Al-ishbili,  “better known by the surnames of Ibnu-l-makiwi® Al-korayshi, is also much  “read. Abt Merwdn Al-mu’aytti® wrote a collection of all the sayings of Malik  “Tbn Ans, which is equally commended. The author took as his model the collec-  “tion which, under the title of Al-bdhir (the illustrious),®! was published by Abt  “ Bekr Mohammed Ibnu-l-haddéd on the sayings of the Imam Shéafa’i.   “The Kitdbu-l-muntekhab (the book of selections) by the Kadi Mohammed Ibn  “ Yahya Ibn Omar Ibn Lubdbah ® is well known as the most accurate and learned  “ performance that ever issued from the pen of any doctor professing the sect of  “ Malik on the traditions respecting that sect, as well as the best commentary on  “ the obscure points in the same traditions.   “The works of Kdsim Ibn Mohammed, known by the surname of Sdhibu-l-  “ wathdyik,® are famous for the perspicuity of the arguments employed and the good  “ style in which they are written. He professed the sect of Shdfa’i, and followed in  “ every respect the practices and religious opinions of the people of Baghdad.   “So much for the works on theology and jurisprudence. Those on grammar, ae  “ rhetoric, and lexicography, are almost innumerable. Among the first in merit .  “stands one composed by Isma’il Ibnu-l-k4sim,* which treats on all topics con-  “nected with the Arabic language. Another production of the same writer on the  “words which have a short alif, or a long one marked with meddah, or a hamzah,*  “is reckoned to be the most complete that ever was written on the subject.     |F    184 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book II.    “©The Kitdbu-l-af’dl (the book of verbs) by Mohammed Ibn ’A’mir Al-maghrebi,  ‘* better known by the surname of Ibnu-l-hnittiyyah®, (the son of the Goth), with  “ the additions by Ibn Tarif, a mault®” of the ’Obeydites, is generally considered to  ‘ be the best work on the subject.   “¢ A compilation of Abi Ghdlib Teméim Ibn Ghflib, known by the surname of  ‘* Tbnu-t-tabbén, on the various topics connected with the language, passes for the  “ best book of its kind, not only on account of the valuable information which he  collected in an abridged state, but also owing to what he introduced of his own,  ‘* and the fidelity of his quotations. The author, I presume, is still living, (may he  live long!) But I cannot proceed any further with my epistle without relating an  “anecdote concerning this distinguished writer. I was told by Abi-l-walid ’Ab-  “ dullah Ibn Mohammed Ibn ’Abdillah, known by the surname of Ibnu-l-faradhi,  “ that when Abi-l-jeysh Mujahid, King of Al-jez4yir® (Algiers) and Denia, conquered  “* the city of Murcia, he sent to Abi Ghalib, who was then residing in that city, the  “ sum of one thousand dinars of Andalus, on condition that he would make an addi-  “tion to the title-page of the said work, and say that it had been written for him.  “‘ This, however, Abi Ghalib refused to do, and returned the money, nor did he  “ ever afterwards comply with the wishes of the Sultan; on the contrary, he said to  the messenger, ‘Tell your master that were he to lavish on me all the treasures  “ of this world, I would persist in my resolution ; I cannot tell a lie; this book of  “‘ mine was not written for him, but for the generality of studious people.’ When  Abi Ghalib’s answer was communicated to Mujéhid, he was very much surprised  “at the boldness and severity of his words, but he could not help admiring the  steel temper of the writer’s soul, and his contempt for worldly considerations.”  ‘“* * Ahmed Ibn Iban Ibn Seyid!® wrote a work on the language, entitled Kitdbu-l-  ‘« *dlimi (the book of the learned), composed of about one hundred parts,’” and  “‘ treating on genders. The subject is therein treated with the fullest details, and  ‘all the nouns in the Arabic language, beginning with globe (al-folk), and ending  with dorrah (a grain of millet), are properly explained.  “©The Kitdbu-n-nawddir (the book of the rarities of speech) by Abt ’Ali Isma’il  “ Tbnu-l-késim,'™ being a sort of glossary to ‘ the book of complement’ (Kitdbu-I-  “ kdémil) by Ibnu-l-’abbés Al-mubarrad,'® is justly celebrated. And, by my life, I  “ do think that the work of Ibnu-l-’abbds exhibits neither the profound knowledge  of grammar nor the exquisite erudition of the former, whose work is likewise more  “‘ abundant in rhetorical and poetical extracts.   “* « An author named Sa’id Ibnu-I-hasan Ar-raba’i,""* who followed in the steps of  ‘the two last-mentioned writers, composed a work entitled ‘the book of gems”  “ (Kitdbu-l-fossiss).     cHaP. 1v.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 185    “© On the science of grammar the following are the most in repute :—Ist.

I might say the same of a work entitled ‘the book of geometrical  “« dimensions’ (Kitdbu-l-masdhati-l-majhilati), the composition of Ahmed fbn Nasr,  “‘ who occupies a distinguished place among the mathematicians of Andalus.   “« © But were I to mention here all the works which are really deserving of notice  “« in any of the seven liberal arts, of which no prudent man will undertake more  “than one at a time, nor excel in more than one, I might protract this my  ‘« narrative to an undue length; I have therefore contented myself with noticing  “‘ such works as are generally considered the standards of their respective sciences,  “ works of which it cannot be said that they remain obscure after being commented  “upon, or that they are compositions exhibiting errors to be corrected, or epitomes  “‘ of larger works in which some of the sense in the original has been lost, or  “ compilations which are confused. As to the works of middling merit, I have  “ taken no pains whatever in enumerating them ; indeed the task would have been  “ above my power, they being as numerous as the drops of water in the ocean, or  “‘as the sands of the desert: the names only of Andalusian authors who have  ‘* written on various subjects are more than can be put upon paper.   “* Tt remains for me to say something on the science of metaphysics and its  “ cultivation in this country. Although Andalus has never been made a field for  “ the dispute or trial of religious controversy, or a repository of various sects and  “opinions, as is the case in the East, (a reason why our proficiency in that  “science should be smaller,) yet, all things considered, I cannot say that we are  “entirely devoid of valuable compositions on the subject, since there have been  ‘“‘among us doctors who not only have professed the religious opinions of the  ‘* Mo’tazelites and observed their dogmas, but have written several works in defence  “ of, and for the propagation of, that sect.

As to me, I follow the sect  ‘of Malik Ibn Ans, that, among the four authorized ones, which is general  “throughout this country; and I have written on the subject a work, which,  ‘although small in size, and containing but few leaves,—a little more than two  “ hundred,—is nevertheless a very useful and instructive one, since I have purged it  ‘“‘ of many errors which abounded in works of the same kind, and have cut a  “ piece out of its length and made it shorter by inserting merely arguments drawn  “ from precedents authenticated, and emanating either from the testimony of the  “good or the sayings of the inspired, and which we firmly believe to be true. I  “ have besides written several other works on the same subject, some which are  “‘ already finished, others nearly so, some only begun, and which I trust in God I  “« shall have leisure to complete ; for certainly it is not literary fame nor honours of  “any sort that I seek by their publication,—it is not praise and its sweet gales  “that I desire to attract by mentioning them here: my sole object and intention  “ being that of contributing to the honour and glory of our Lord, the Almighty,  “the magnificent, whose favour and assistance I implore, and whose mercy I  “beseech for such transgressions as I may have been guilty of in the composition  “of them. But to return.   “« T have said that this country was situated far from the fountains of science  “and the abode of the learned; and yet, among the works which I have just  “ enumerated, there are many which thou wilt look for in vain either in Al-ahwa4z,  “or in Persia, Diydr-Modhar, Diydr-Rabi’,""*!

Another commentary on the holy book, entitled Kitdbu-  “ Ltafstrt ’drdbi-l-kordnt (interpretation of obscure words contained in the Koran),  “is also the production of this author, who wrote no less than seventy-seven  “ different works on various topics.

This  “ last-mentioned work has of late been increased by Abii-l-hej4j Al-bayési (of  “ Baéza), who is now residing at Tunis, the capital of Africa proper, where he  “enjoys the favours and protection of the Sultén.   “The Kitdbu-l-mudhdhafert,® so called from the name of its author, Al-  “ mudhdhafer Ibn Al-afttas, King of Badajoz, a work almost equal to the Matin  “of Ibnu Hayyd4n in number of volumes, and which embraces the political and  “literary history of the times, is justly considered to be one of the most brilliant  “ productions of the age.   “A history of the Sulténs of the Lamtumni dynasty, by Ibn Sdhibi-s-salat,'®  “and another on the same subject by Ibnu-s-seyrafi,""” of Granada, which I have  “not read, but which is much praised by Ibnu Ghalib, are among our best works  “ofthe kind. The same author (Ibnu Ghélib) says that Abi-l-hasan As-sdlimi '  “wrote a history of the second civil war in Africa and Andalus, disposed chrono-  “ logically, beginning at five hundred and thirty-nine (a. p. 1144-5), and ending  “in five hundred and forty-seven (a. p. 1152-3).   “ Abi-l-k4sim Ibn Bashktiw4l is counted among our most eminent historians.  “We have by him a biographical dictionary of illustrious Andalusians since the  “times of the conquest down to his own days,’® to which he added such infor-  “mation on the history and topography of Cordova, and other principal cities of  “ Andalus, as came within the scope of his work. He wrote also a biographical  “dictionary of distinguished authors, under the title of Kitdbu-s-silat (the book  “of the gift).

But this is not the moment for judging of the  “ respective merits of these two authors. The book very much resembles the  “ supplement to the Kitdbu-l-haddyik (the book of enclosed gardens) by Ibn Faraj.   “ At the same time, and almost in our days,** Al-fath published his Kaldyidu-l-  “*ikiydn (golden necklaces), a work full of eloquence, and held in great estimation  “by the learned.

Its contents are the lives of illustrious men contained in his  “ Kaldyid, and others who lived before them. Since the publication of these two  “ works by Al-fath, a work entitled Simétu-l-jumdni wa sakittu-l-marjdni (pearl  “necklaces and showers of seed pearls) has appeared, by Abé ’Amru Ibnu-l-im4m.*  “ Tt is a sort of supplement to the Kaldyid and to the Matmah, wherein the author  “ has introduced the lives of all those eminent men who either escaped Al-fat’h’s  “research or lived after him ; as likewise of many distinguished authors who  “ flourished since Al-fat’h’s death up to the end of the sixth century of the Hijra.  “Lastly, a supplement to the two preceding works, containing a biography of  “eminent men who flourished likewise in the seventh century of the Hijra, has  “been published of late years by Abii Bahr Sefwan Ibn Idris, from Murcia, under  “ the title of Zdédu-l-musdfiri® (provisions for the traveller). It is a small volume,  “but precious for its information.   “ Abt Mohammed ’Abdullah Ibn Ibrahim Al-hijéri (from Guadalaxara) wrote the  “ Kitdbu-l-mas‘habi ft fadhdyili-l-maghrebi® (the book of the chatterer on the excel-  “ences of the West), which appeared after the Kaldyid and the Dhakhirah. It  “embraces the history of Andalus from the earliest times down to his days. The  “ author, too, followed a new plan in the arrangement of his materials, since, along  “with his exquisite historical information, he described at full length some of the  “principal cities in that country, enumerated the peculiarities of the soil, and  “ treated on matters which belong to the science of geography, giving also numerous  “extracts from the works of distinguished authors and poets, as the reader must  “have remarked by our frequent quotations from the said work. A better history  “of Andalus never was written,—a reason why it was so much extolled and  “ praised by our ancestor ’Abdu-l-mdlik Ibn Sa’id,*? who worked upon it, and  “wrote a supplement, which was continued by his two sons Ahmed and Mo-  “hammed, afterwards by Misa, son of Mohammed, and lastly by ’Alf, son of  “ Misa, the writer of this book, and the author of the work entitled Falaku-l-adabi-  “ Lmuheytti biholt lisdni-l-’arabi (the book of the sphere, embracing the beauties of     Polite  literature.    196 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    “ the Arabic language), which consists of two parts,—one relating to the history of  “the East, with this title, Al-mush’rak ft holt-l-mash’reki (the light of the rising  “ sun on the beauties of the East),—and the other on the history of the West, called  “ Al-mugh’rab ft holt-l-maghrebi (the eloquent speaker on the beauties of the West).  ‘ All the works that I have enumerated, from Al-hijéri’s primitive work down to  “the supplements written by various members of my family, and completed by the  ‘“* humble and undeserving writer of these pages, are more than sufficient to instruct  “* the readers on the history of this country, since they are the work of six different  ‘ authors, and embrace a period of one hundred and twenty-five years,*°—including  “‘my continuation down to the year six hundred and forty-five of the Hijra  “ (a.p. 1247-8) ;—a work in which the studious will find a full account of the events  “‘ witnessed by the writers, together with numerous selections in prose and verse  “ from the writings of eminent authors, or the sayings of clever men, collected with  “ great care and assiduity through the East and West, and of which pertinent  “ examples are given in the course of this book. The readers will also find a full  “ notice of people who escaped publicity in their time, and authors who had been  ‘mentioned by previous writers, but who have been placed in a more perspicuous  “and orderly manner under the cities or towns whence their patronymics are  “derived. So, for instance, Ibn Besém will be found under the head of Shan-  “tareyn (Santarem), his birth-place, Al-fat’h under Seville, Ibnu-l-im4ém under  “ Ezija, Al-hijari under Guadalaxara, and so forth.   ‘* Respecting works on literature, whether in prose or verse, I can mention first of  “all the Serdju-l-adab® (torch of polite literature), by Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Abi-l-  ‘ khissél, from Segura, who is justly held as the prince of Andalusian authors.  “ He is said to have written it in rivalry of the Kitdbu-n-nawddir (the book of  ‘‘memorable sayings), by Abi ’Ali Al-k4li, and of the Kitdb szohori-l-adabi  “« (flowers of polite literature), by Al-hossri.“© Of the same kind is the Kitdbu-l-  “ wdjibi-l-adabi (manual of literature), by my father Misa Ibn Mohammed Ibn  “‘ Sa’id, whose name alone is a voucher for its contents.

Indeed were I merely to  “ mention here the titles of all the good works that exist on the subject I should  “ run the risk of protracting this my narrative to an indefinite length ; I shall there-  “ fore confine myself to noticing a few only of the most prominent, such as those of  “ Tbn Kharif,“ Ar-rondi,*? and the Sheikh Abi-l-hasan Ibn ’Osfir,** from Seville,  “‘ who surpassed all his contemporaries in the science of grammar, in which he  “ arrived at the extreme end of knowledge, his works being at the present moment  “« the books of reference and authority in the East as well as in the West. I lately  “received from Africa proper a book by this author, on syntax, entitled <Al-  “ mukarreb ft-l-nahu (the book of approximation on the science of syntax), which  “is to be found in almost every large town in Yemen, and has flown on the wings  “ of fame.   “The Sheikh Abi ’Ali Ash-shalibini has also acquired immense reputation by  “* his commentary on the syntax, entitled Kitdbu-t-tautiyati-l-jaziliyyati (the treading  “ on the footsteps of Al-jazili).”   “ Tbnu-s-sid Al-bathalidsi, Ibnu-t-tard4wah, and As-sohayli have published several  “ treatises on grammar, which do their authors great honour, and are in the hands  “‘of every student. And lastly there is a famous commentary on the works of  “ Sibauyeh by Abi-l-hasan Ibn Kharif.   “In the science of geography it will be sufficient to mention the Kitdbu-l-mesdlek Geography.  “ wa-l-memdlek (the book of routes and kingdoms), by Abi ’Obeyd Al-bekri Al-  “ondbi (from Onoba), and the Kitdbu-l-mu’ajem,” being a geographical dictionary  “wherein all names of cities and kingdoms are properly explained. The Mas‘hab,  “by Al-hijéri, contains also, as I have remarked elsewhere, much valuable  “information on the geography of Andalus and the topography of its principal  “cities. I may add to this the present work, which includes every one of the  “gupplements and additions written by my ancestors, and where the readers will  “ find the cream of whatever has been said by ancient or modern writers on the  “ subject.   ‘* Music was cultivated in Andalus with the greatest success, and works treating Music.  “fully on the science of tune, as well as on various instruments and the art of  “‘ making them, are common among us. The principal is that of Abti Bekr Ibn Bajeh,     Medicine.

Another  “ Andalusian musician who lived in the sixth century of the Hijra, and whose name  “was Yahya Ibnu-l-haddéj Al-a’lem,** wrote a collection of songs in imitation of  “ that of Abi-1-faraj.   ‘“‘ Medicine has always flourished in this country, and among the numerous  “« treatises on this science written by Andalusian physicians several may be pointed  ‘‘ out which have attained the greatest celebrity not only in the West but in the  ‘« East, where they are much used and consulted. Of this number is the Kitdbu-t-  “ teystr (introduction to medicine), by ’Abdu-l-m4lik Ibn Abi-l-’ol4 Ibn Zohr, who  ‘« is likewise the author of the Kitdbu-l-agh’diyati (the book of diet), which has  “‘ become famous throughout the East and West.   “ Abd-l’abbds Ibnu-r-raémiyyah® Al-ishbili (from Seville), our friend and contem-  ‘porary, has written several standard works on this science, among which I must  ‘‘make particular mention of a treatise on simples used as medicaments (Kitdbu-  “ |-adwiyati-l-mufridah).   “ Abi Mohammed,” from Malaga, who is now residing in Cairo, is the author  “« of d voluminous work, a sort of dictionary, wherein he has disposed alphabetically  “all the names of simples and medicaments that he could collect and analyze  ‘himself, or which were described in the works of Al-ghéfeki,®* Az-zahréwi, and  “« Sherif Al-idrisi, the Sicilian,®® with many others. And certainly a better work  ‘on the science cannot easily be imagined.   ‘« Natural philosophy also flourishes with us. The prince of this science among  “‘ us is at present Abi-l-walid Ibn Roshd, from Cordova, who has written several  “ treatises on the various branches of that science, notwithstanding the aversion and  “dislike which ’Abdu-l-mimen, son of Al-manstr, always showed towards the  “« students who practised it, and notwithstanding his having been put in prison by  ‘ order of that Sultén for persisting in his favourite studies. The same might be  “ said of Ibn Habib,*’ whom the same Sultan caused to be put to death because it  ‘ was proved against him that he worked secretly at that science, which is now  “a proscribed one in this country ; this being the reason why men inclined to it  “« cultivate and practise it only in secret, and why books on the topic are so very  “* scarce.   ‘* We have, nevertheless, several astronomical treatises by Ibn Zeyd Al-askaf  “‘ (the Bishop) of Cordova,*® who was a great favourite with the Sultén Al-  ‘* mustanser, son of An-ndssir Al-merwaéni.

Tue present Book will contain, as we announced in our Preface, an account of the  famous city of Cordova,—the seat of a mighty empire which subdued all its enemies,  —and a description of its blessed mosque, built by the Beni Umeyyah, filled with all  sorts of rarities, and ornamented with dazzling magnificence ; together with some  details on the sumptuous seats of Medinatu-s-sahré and Medinatu-s-sdhirah, the  former the court of the Beni An-nassir, the latter the residence of the Beni Abi  ’A’mir. It will likewise describe the pleasure-gardens and luxuriant fields in the  neighbourhood, and give a minute account of their natural as well as artificial  beauties ; and, lastly, embrace the narrative of events which happened within its  precincts: all being subjects of the greatest interest, which will fill with delight the  hearts of the lovers of information, and remain deeply impressed on the minds of  the acute and the intelligent.   Cordova is perhaps of all Mohammedan cities that which has been most fully  described by natives as well as by foreign writers. The East and the West abound  with accounts, some in prose, others in verse, in which the glories and magnificence  of that splendid capital have been so minutely recorded as to expel from the  imagination of the antiquarian all fear of their obliteration. An Eastern author,  among others, gives us the following picture -—‘t Cordova,” such are his words,  ‘* is the capital of Andalus, and the mother of its cities; the court of the Khalifs,  ‘Sand the seat of their empire. It was in ancient times the court of the infidel  * kings of Andalus, and afterwards became the residence of the Mohammedan  ** sovereigns who succeeded them. It was the abode of science, the place of refuge     cHAP, I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 201    “ of Sunnah and tradition, and the dwelling of several among the tdbi’s (followers) and  “ disciples of the ¢dbi’s, some authors even going so far as to state that it was inha-  “ bited by more than one of the as‘hdb (companions) of the Prophet, (may the Lord’s  “favour be with them !) a point which has been seriously contested. Cordova is a  “ populous city, full of primitive buildings, enjoying a good temperature, abounding  “ with springs of the sweetest water, and surrounded on all sides by gardens, olive  “ plantations, villages, and castles. Numerous springs and winding brooks irrigate  “ and fertilize the neighbouring fields and farms, which in point of extent, careful  “ cultivation, and abundant produce, have nowhere their equal in the world.”   Ar-rdzi calls Cordova the mother of cities, the navel of Andalus, the court of the  kingdom in ancient and modern times, during the ages of ignorance as well as  during the period of Islam. Its river, he says, is the largest in all Andalus, and over  it was thrown a bridge, which not only was the finest in that country, but which for  its structure, beautiful design, and colossal dimensions, was reputed one of the  wonders of the earth.   Another writer describes it as the largest city in all Andalus, and one which  had no rival either in the East or the West in point of size, population, mag-  nificence of buildings, width and cleanliness of the streets, spaciousness of markets,  number and beauty of mosques, and quantity of baths and inns. Some of the  tative authors go so far as to state that in point of magnitude it approached  Baghdéd. But the report is no doubt exaggerated.   It is, says another, a fortified town, surrounded by massive and lofty stone walls,  and has very fine streets. It was in times of old the court and residence of many  infidel kings, whose palaces are still visible within the precincts of the walls. The  inhabitants are famous for their courteous and polished manners, their superior  intelligence, their exquisite taste and magnificence in their meals, drink, dress, and  horses. There thou wouldst see doctors shining with all sorts of learning, lords  distinguished by their virtues and generosity, warriors renowned for their ex-  peditions into the country of the infidels, and officers experienced in all kinds of  warfare. The Cordovans were further celebrated for the elegance and richness of  their dress, their attention to religious duties, their strict observance of the hours  of prayer, the high respect and veneration in which they held their great mosque,  their aversion to wine and their destruction of wine-vases whenever they found  any, their abhorrence of every illicit practice, their glory in nobility of descent and  nilitary enterprise, and their success in every department of the sciences.   The last-mentioned author says, ‘‘ Cordova, under the Sultans of the family of  “ Umeyyah, became the tent of Islam, the place of refuge for the learned, the foun-  “ dation of the throne of the Beni Merwdn, the place of resort of the noblest families   VOL.

To it came from all parts of the world  “‘ students anxious to cultivate poetry, to study the sciences, or to be instructed  “« in divinity or the law; so that it became the meeting-place of the eminent in all  ‘matters, the abode of the learned, and the place of resort for the studious : its  “interior was always filled with the eminent and the noble of all countries, its  ‘‘ literary men and soldiers were continually vying with each other to gain dis-  “ tinction,’ and its precincts never ceased to be the arena of the distinguished, the  “ hippodrome of the foremost, the halting-place of the noble, and the repository of  “ the true and virtuous. Cordova was to Andalus what the head is to the body, or  ‘* what the breast is to the lion.”   A poet has written on Cordova the following distich, which is not altogether  devoid of merit :   “Do not talk of the court of Baghdad and its dlittering magnificence, do  “‘ not praise Persia and China and their manifold advantages,   “ For there is no spot on the earth like Cordova, nor in the whole world  “ men like the Beni Hamdin.” ?   Tbnu Sa’id calls Cordova the bride of the kingdom of that name; meaning that  she was provided with every requisite to make a city famous, and that she had  within herself all the beauties and ornaments of a beautiful maid who is being taken  to the house of her lord and spouse. Indeed no comparison can be made more  adequate than this ; since the fact of her having been the residence of so many  Sultans constitutes the diadem on her head; her necklace is strung with the’  inestimable pearls collected in the Ocean of language by her orators and poets ; her  robes are made of the banners of science, those learned authors for whom neither  prose nor verse had any limits, and whose praises it is not prudent to let loose;  and, lastly, the masters in all arts and trades form the skirt of her gown. After  this Ibnu Sa’id gives a sort of argument of his work, from which we shall proceed    . to quote, taking care to introduce accounts from other writers in order that in-    formation may spring from comparison.   There are various opinions among historians as to who was the founder of  Cordova. Some, as Ibnu Hayydn, Ar-rdzi, Al-hijdri, say that it was built by  Octavius, the second Czsar of Rome, who conquered the whole earth, and lined  with copper the bed of the Tiber; the same emperor from whom the Roman Era,  which began thirty-eight years before the birth of the Messiah, is computed. To  this monarch, who, in the opinion of the above-mentioned authors, was the builder  of the great bridge in Cordova, is the foundation of that city ascribed, together with  that of other places equally important ; such as Merida, Seville, and Saragossa.®  Al-hijéri, however, is of opinion that these three cities, as well as Cordova, owed     CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 203    ‘their foundation to the lieutenants of that king, and not to himself; for having sent  to Andalus four of his principal officers, he gave them instructions to divide the  country into four provinces, to take the command of the armies stationed in them,  and to build each a city which should be the capital of the province placed under  his charge ; and that the lieutenants, having done what they were ordered to do,  each built a city to which he gave his name. Such is the account given by Al- |  hijdri, who is no doubt mistaken, since the four above-mentioned cities do not  derive their names, as he says, from their founders, but from the localities in which  they stand, or the quality of the ground on which they were built, and other cir-  cumstances quite independent of the names of their governors or founders.   However, towards the end of the Roman empire, Cordova became the capital of  the sons of ’Ayssu,‘ son of Ishak, son of Ibrahim, (on whom be peace!) another  nation of Romans, who conquered Andalus and settled in it, keeping possession of  the country until they themselves were subdued by the Goths, the sons of Yéfeth,  in whose hands was the empire when the Moslems invaded Andalus. During the  reign of the monarchs of Gothic descent, Cordova cannot be said to have been the  capital of Andalus ; for although it served as a place of temporary residence to some  of their kings, it was not, properly speaking, the court of the empire. By the  establishment of Islim in it, its importance increased ; it became the capital of the  Mohammedan empire, and the citadel of the family of Merwdn, so that Seville and  Toledo were soon obliged to acknowledge its pre-eminence. God Almighty does  what he pleases, for he is the master of all things, and in his hands are power and  command. There is no God but Him, the great! the high!   Respecting the name of Cordova, Abii ’Obeyd Al-bekri tells us, that according to Etymology of  Gothic pronunciation it ought to be written with a dha with a point over it, thus,  Kordhobah. Al-hijari writes it with a tta and a dhamma, Korttubah ; but Eastern  writers in general have corrupted the pronunciation of this word, as they have done  with many others, by substituting a kesrah for the dhamma, and writing it thus,  Korttebah. As to the etymology of the word Korttubah, we find in the Forjatu-l-  anfus, by Ibnu Ghalib, that it is a Greek word, meaning in that language Al-kolibu-  Lmashkilah, that is, doubtful hearts.© Ibnu Sa’id agrees with these authors as to  the manner in which the word Kordhubah is to be spelt, but he entertains quite a  different opinion as to the origin of the city, which he says was founded by the  *Amalekites (Carthaginians), and not by the Romans; he also gives a different  etymology to that word, which he pretends means in Arabic ajaru sdkiniha (reward  of its inhabitants).   Tonu Sa’id (the mercy of God be upon him!) describes the kingdom of Cordova  before all the rest in Andalus ; for, says he, it was for many centuries the seat of  government. The ancient kings of Andalus fixed in it the seat of their empire, and     204 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    never moved from it; then came the Beni Umeyyah, who also held their court in  Cordova, although they did not stay in it all the year round, but divided their time  between their pleasure-houses Medinatu-z-zahré and Medinatu-z-zéhirah. They  chose to reside in Cordova in preference to any other city of Andalus, for its  convenient situation and delightful temperature. It became in the course of time  the meeting-place of the learned from all countries, and, owing to the power and  splendour of the mighty dynasty that ruled over it, it contained more excellences  than any other kingdom on the face of the earth.   But before proceeding in our account of Cordova we deem it necessary to acquaint  the readers with the titles, divisions, and. contents of the various chapters de-  voted by Ibnu Sa’id to the description of that city, and forming part of that great  historical work which we have so often quoted in the course of our narrative, and  to which we shall have still numerous opportunities of referring.   Tbnu Sa’id (may God show him mercy !) followed a plan of his own, and divided  his history into three volumes or sections.”   The first bears the title of ‘‘ the book of variegated leaves on the ornamental  beauties of Andalus.”   The second, which treats on the history of Sicily, he called ‘ the book of bar-  barous cacophony on the beauties of the island of Sicily.”   The third, which embraces the history of all the infidel nations inhabiting the  great continent (of Europe), is entitled ‘“‘ the book of the extreme limit on the  beauties of the great land (or continent of Europe).”   Each of these volumes he divided into several books, and these into numerous  chapters.® For instance, the first, which contained the description of Andalus, was  composed of four books; the first entitled ‘‘ ornaments of the bride on the de-  scription of the west of Andalus ;” the second, ‘the lips of the beautiful dusky  maid on the description of the central provinces of Andalus ;” the third, ‘‘ the book  of familiarity and friendship on the description of eastern Andalus ;” and the fourth,  ‘‘the book of dubious lines on the geography and the history of those provinces  which are in the hands of the worshippers of the crucified.”   The second volume, which treated on the history of Sicily, he likewise divided  into several books ; and the same may be said of that which treats on the history  of the great land (continent).   The first book of the first volume being that which contains the history of  Cordova, and the provinces once subject to it, and likewise that which forms the  present object of our narrative, we shall describe it more minutely. Its title is,  as we have above stated, ‘‘ the book of ornaments of the bride on the description of  western Andalus.” It is divided into seven chapters (each chapter being also  divided into several paragraphs), the titles of which are as follow.®     CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 205    Ist. The book of the golden robes on the beauties of the kingdom of Cordova.   2nd. The book of the pure golden particles on the description of the kingdom of  Seville. .   3rd. The book of varnished deceits on the description of the kingdom of Malaga.   4th. The book of the horses on the beauties of the kingdom of Bathalids  (Badajoz). :   5th. The book of the fresh new milk on the description of the kingdom of Shilb  (Silves).   6th. The book of the illuminated preface on the description of the kingdom of  Béjah (Beja).   7th. The book of enclosed gardens on the description of the kingdom of  Ulishibonah (Lisbon).   In every one of these chapters the author relates all the particulars, whether  historical or geographical, which he could collect respecting each province, (may  God remunerate him amply for his trouble in illustrating the history of the  Moslems!) In that concerning Cordova, for instance, he accumulated the most  precious information on the size, extent, and population of that capital, on the  magnificence and splendour of its mosques, palaces, and other public buildings,  on the fertility and careful cultivation of the fields and lands in the neighbourhood,  on the peculiarities and productions of the soil, and the like. He also divided the  chapter exclusively consecrated to Cordova into eleven smaller divisions, each  treating on one of the districts which acknowledged at one time the jurisdiction  of Cordova. The Ist describes Cordova and the country about it ;'° 2nd, Bolkinah  (Porcuna) ; 3rd, Al-kosseyr (Alcozer) ; 4th, Al-mudowdr (Almodovar del rio) ; 5th,  Moréd (Morente?) ; 6th, Astijah (Ezija) ; 7th, Ghdfek ; 8th, Koznah (Cuzna) ; 9th,  Kabrah (Cabra) ; 10th, Astaba (Estepa) ; 11th, Al-yasénah (Lucena). :   Lastly, Ibnu Sa’id subdivided the chapter treating exclusively on the city of  Cordova into four parts. Part 1, the description of Cordova; part 2, that of the  city of Az-zahré; part 3, that of the city of Az-zdhirah ; part 4, the description  of the suburb called Shakandah, and the district of Waza’h."" '   The dimensions of Cordova have been differently stated, owing, no doubt, to the Bie ana oxen  rapid increase of its population and buildings under the various Sultans of the “  dynasty of Merwén, and to the heart-rending calamities and disasters by which it  was afflicted under the reign of the last sovereigns of that house. Ibnu Sa’id,  quoting Ash-shakandi’s epistle, says that the city of Cordova, with the adjoining  cities of Az-zahr&é and Az-zéhirah, covered at one time an extent of ground  measuring ten miles in length, all which distance, adds that author, might be   / traversed at night by the light of lamps. The circumference of the walls of the     Number of  suburbs it  contained.    206 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    city is stated at thirty thousand cubits,'? and the extent, exclusive of the suburbs,  is said to have been sixteen thousand cubits in length from south to north ; it is,  moreover, said that the buildings of Cordova in the time of the Beni Umeyyah  were continued to a distance of eight farsangs in length and of two in breadth,  which makes twenty-four miles by six; all this space being covered with palaces,  mosques, gardens, and houses built along the banks of the Guadalquivir, the only  river in Andalus to which the Arabs gave a name.'* Cordova is further described  as a city which never ceased augmenting in size and increasing in splendour and  importance from the occupation of it by the Moslems until the year four hundred  of the Hijra (a. p. 1009-10), when, civil war breaking out in it, that mighty capital  fell from its ancient splendour, went on gradually decaying and losing its former  magnificence, until the moment of its final destruction in the month of Shawwal of  the year six hundred and thirty-three of the Hijra (Sept. a. p. 1236), when it fell  into the hands of the Christians.""*   Another historian states the circumference of Cordova, namely, of that part only  comprised within the walls, exclusive of the suburbs, at thirty-three thousand  cubits, of which one thousand one hundred were covered by the royal palaces.  Another says that Cordova was divided into five large districts or cities, separated  one from another by a high and well fortified wall, and that all these put together  measured three miles in length and one in width.   The suburbs are said to have been twenty-one in number, each of them provided  with mosques, markets, and baths for the use of its inhabitants ; so that the people  of one had no occasion to repair to the other, either for religious purposes or to buy  the necessaries of life. Ibnu Bashkiwél, who has given us a description of Cordova  during its greatest prosperity, and when the influx of population was at its height,    - has preserved the names of the suburbs which once were joined to Cordova.    Two lay to the south, on the opposite bank of the river, and their names were  Shakandah and Munyat-’A’jab (the garden of the wonders). Nine to the west,  namely, Hawdnttu-r-rihdn (the shops of the sellers of sweet basil),""* Rabadh-ar-  rakkdkin (the suburb of the bakers), Mesjidu-l-kahfi (the mosque of the cave),  Baldtt Mugheythi (the palace of Mugheyth), Mesjidu-sh-shakdi (the mosque of  misfortune), Hamdmu-l-anbirt (the baths of Al-anbiri),!° Mesjidu-s-sorrir (the  mosque of rejoicings), Mesjidu-r-raudhah'” (the mosque of the garden), and  As-sojunu-l-kadim (the old prison). Three to the north, Bdbu-l-yahid (the gate  of the Jews), Mesjid Umm-moslemah (the mosque of Umm Moslemah), and the  Rissdfah. The seven remaining lay to the east ; their names were Saldr,’* Fardn  Barbal, Al-borj, Munyat-’ Abdillah (the garden of ’Abdallah), Munyatu-l-mugheyrah  (the garden of Mugheyrah), Asz-zdhirah, and Medinatu-l-’attkah (the old city).     cHaP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 207    In the midst of the city, and surrounded by these suburbs, stood the Kassdbah  (citadel) of Cordova, which was fortified and defended by high walls, although  the suburbs were not so; but during the civil wars a ditch was dug round the ~  suburbs, and the whole enclosed within high and strong walls raised at the same  time. The circumference of this wall, according to Ibnu Sa’id, was twenty-  four miles, including Shakandah, which, being an ancient walled town, was also  comprised within the limits of the fortifications of Cordova.   The gates of Cordova were seven in number, according to Ibnu Bashkiiwal. Gates.  Ist. The gate of the bridge (Bdbu-l-kantarah), also called Bdbu-l-wddt, or gate  of the river. 2nd. Bédbu-l-jeztrati-l-khadhrd (the gate of Algesiras), also leading  to the river. Both these gates looked to the south. 3rdly. Bdbu-l-hadfd (the  iron gate), named also Bdb Sarakosta (gate of Saragossa), Bdb Ibn ’Abdi-l-jabbdr  (the gate of the son of ’Abdi-l-jabbdr) ; also called gate of Toledo, and gate of  the Christian (Bdbu-r-rimiyyah). At the latter-mentioned gate was the junction  of the causeways built by the Romans, to which we have alluded in another part  of this work, and which we have said made the circuit of the earth, coming from  Cadiz, Carmona, passing by Cordova, and then going to Rome through Saragossa,  Tarragona, Narbonne, and the great continent.!® 4th. The gate of Talavera, which  was also called gate of Leon. 5th. The gate of ’A’mir the Korayshite, opposite  to the cemetery of that name. 6th. Bdbu-l-jiz (or the gate of the walnuts), also  known by the name of gate of Badajoz. 7th, and last, Bdbu-l-’dttarin (the gate of  the druggists), commonly called the gate of Seville. There was still another gate,  formerly called Bdbu-l-yahid (the gate of the Jews), but good Moslems having  objected to the name, it was named Bdbu-l-hodi (the gate of direction). The poet  Abd ’A’mir Ibn Shohayd wrote on this gate the following distich :   “‘ They saw near to the gate of the Jews the star of Abi-l-hasan darken  “* and vanish.   “When the Jews saw him commanding over their gate, they took him for  ** Joseph.” ®   The same historian, describing the royal palace of Cordova, says that it was an The Royal  ancient building inhabited in former days by the infidel Sult4ns who had ruled over Palace  the country since the time of Moses.” The interior of it, as well as the adjoining  buildings, was full of primeval constructions, and wonderful remains of the Greeks,  Romans, and Goths,” and other nations now extinct, and the interior apartments  were so magnificently decorated as to dazzle with the beauty of their ornaments the  eyes of the beholders. This palace the Khalifs of the house of Merwan chose for  their residence, and tried to ornament and embellish by all possible means, adding  new rooms, and filling them with elegant rarities. But this was not the only     208 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    improvement which the sovereigns of that family made in their capital, for, as we  shall observe hereafter, they left every where in Cordova traces of their wise admi-  nistration,—planting delicious gardens, supplying the city with water brought from  the distant mountains, called the mountains of Cordova,” and furnishing their capital  with abundance of provisions of all sorts. The water thus brought from the moun-  tains was conveyed to this palace, and thence distributed into every corner and  quarter of the city by means of leaden pipes, from which it flowed into basins of  different shapes, made of the purest gold, the finest silver, or plated brass, as well  as into vast lakes, curious tanks, and amazing reservoirs,* and fountains of Grecian  marble beautifully carved. In this palace, too, was an astonishing jet d’eau which  raised the water to a considerable height, and the like of which was nowhere to be  seen in the East or West.   The palace here described by Ibnu Bashkiwél must be the same which some  early writers designate under the name of Baldtt Rudherik, (the palace of Roderic ;)  not that this king built it, but when the Arabs defeated him, and conquered his  kingdom, knowing that whenever he came to Cordova he took up his abode in it,  they called it by his name. By whom it was built is not ascertained ; the most  current opinion among the natives was that one of their ancient kings* who  resided in the fortress of Almodovar, below Cordova, was the builder of it, and this  they relate in the following manner. They say that as this king was one day  hunting, he came to the spot where Cordova was afterwards built, which was  then a dreary desert, the site now occupied by the palace being covered by an  impervious thicket of brambles. Near this spot the king let fly a favourite hawk  of his at a partridge, which, rising in the field afterwards called Kudyat Abt  ’Obeydah (the hillock of Abt ’Obeydah), passed him, and alighted on the thicket.  Thither the hawk flew in chase of the partridge, and the king followed in quest of  his hawk, until, not seeing him appear, and fearing lest he should be entangled  among the branches and unable to move, the king ordered the thicket to be cleared  away that his hawk might be released. While his people were employed in cutting  the underwood, behold! the top of a large and magnificent building was discovered  by the workmen, a most amazing structure, all built with large blocks of stone  joined together with molten lead. The king, who was an intelligent and enter-  prising man, immediately ordered an excavation to be made, and the building was  speedily laid open in all its length and breadth; proceeding in their work they  came to the foundations, which they found lying in the water, and resting upon a  stratum of small pebbles, there introduced by art of old. When the king saw this,  he exclaimed, ‘‘ This is no doubt the work of some famous monarch, and I must  “have it rebuilt.” Upon which he issued orders that the building should be     CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN."" 209    restored to its primitive state, which being done, and the place made habitable, he  visited it as often as any of his royal castles ; for whenever he made the tour of his  province, or passed near it on his way to some military expedition, he always resided  in it for some length of time. This induced many of his subjects to settle in the  neighbourhood, and little by little the city of Cordova was built, and the palace  which stood in the middle of it became the abode of the kings, his successors.   But to return to Ibnu Bashktwal’s description. ‘ Among the gates of the  “ palace,—those gates,” says that historian, ‘‘ which God Almighty opened for the  “ redress of injuries, the help of the oppressed, and the dispensing of impartial judg-  “ments in all cases of law,—the principal is one which has a projecting balcony,”  “ without its equal in the world. This gate, which gave entrance to the palace,  “was furnished with folding-doors covered with iron plates, to which was affixed a  “ brass ring of exquisite workmanship, and representing a man with his mouth wide  “open. This extraordinary work of art, which took its rise at the lower part of the  “gate, and served at the same time as a bar to the gate and as a knocker, had in  “former times belonged to one of the gates of the city of Narbonne, in the country  “of the Franks ; but when the Amir Mohammed” took that city from the Chris-  “tians he had it removed and brought to Cordova, and placed on the principal  “gate of his palace. On a line with this, and looking to the south, there was  “another gate, called Bdbu-l-jenndn (the gate of the gardens) ; and opposite to it,  “on a platform overlooking the Guadalquivir, two mosques famous for their  “sanctity and the numerous miracles wrought in them, in either of which the  “Sultan Mohammed Ar-r4dhi* used to sit to administer justice to his subjects,  “anxious to gain thereby the abundant rewards of the Almighty. A third, called  “ Bdbu-l-wddt (the gate of the river), and a fourth, called Béb Koriah (the gate of  “Coria), opened to the north. There was a fifth and last gate, known by the name  “of Babu-l-jdmi’ (the gate of the great mosque), because the Khalifs used in  “ancient times to go out of it whenever they visited the great mosque on Fridays,  “carpets being spread under their feet the whole of the way.” However, most of  these gates, Ibnu Bashkiiwal tells us, were either destroyed or blocked up during the  civil war under the reign of ’Abdu-l-jabbar.   Besides the royal palace here alluded to there were in and out of Cordova ean  Various houses and gardens, also built by the Sulténs and Khalifs of the house of gardens be-  Merwin for their habitation or their pleasure. We shall describe some of the the Khalifs  sais celebrated. Ibnu Sa’id says, ‘‘ I shall now proceed to the description of the   “Ppleasure-gardens and public promenades where the people of Cordova passed  “their leisure hours, or which they visited for the sake of recreation and amuse-    “ment. Of these some belonged to the Sultan, others to wealthy citizens. Among  VoL, I. 25     210 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book 111.    “the former are counted to the north the palace of the Rissdéfah, which ’Abdu-r-  ‘* rahm4n Ibn Mu’awiyeh built for himself in the beginning of his reign, and in  “ which he used to reside most of his time. He also planted a most beautiful  ‘“‘ garden, to which he brought all kinds of rare and exotic plants and fine trees  “from every country, taking care to supply it with sufficient water for irrigation.  ‘* His passion for flowers and plants went even so far as to induce him to send  ‘* agents to Syria and other countries, with a commission to procure him all sorts  “* of seeds and plants ; and, when brought to Andalus, these productions of distant  ‘“‘ regions and various climatés failed not to take root, blossom, and bear fruit  ‘in the royal gardens, whence they afterwards spread all over the country.  “ From this garden originates the pomegranate, called Safart,*° which in point of  “ flavour, smallness of seed, and abundance of juice, has not its equal in the  ‘“‘ world, and is superior to any other fruit growing in Andalus. The manner in  ‘‘ which this fruit was introduced into the country, and the origin of its name, are  “ thus related. They say that one of the agents sent by ’Abdu-r-rahman to Syria,  “* for the purpose of providing him with every exotic plant he could procure, sent  ‘him from Damascus, among other rarities, a sort of pomegranate, which being  “* originally from the garden called Risséfat-Hishédm was, when planted in Andalus,  “ known by the name of Rissdff. Being proud of them, ’Abdu-r-rahmén boasted  “of the acquisition before his favourites, and proceeded to describe the nature  ‘“and qualities of the tree, the flavour and colour of the fruit, and the manner  ‘‘ in which it had been procured and sent to him. There happened to be among  “the company a man of the name of Safar Ibn ’Obeyd Al-kal’ai, one of the  “settlers from Al-urdan,*' and who is further represented as belonging to the  “* Ansaris who bore the colours of the Prophet in battle, as well as those of the  “ Khalifs of the house of Umeyyah. To this Safar the Sultin gave some of the  “fruit, and he, keeping the seed, sowed it some time afterwards in a village  “of the district of Raya, where he resided; he nursed the tree, took care of it,  ‘lopped its branches, and when the tree came to bear fruit he selected the best  ‘“* pomegranate and repaired with it to court, where he presented himself to  “?Abdu-r-rahman. No sooner did the Sultdn see the fruit, which so much  ‘resembled that of his gardens in colour and appearance, and the flavour of  ‘which was equally fine, than he was greatly astonished, and inquired from Safar  ‘‘how he had procured it. Safar then acquainted him with the circumstance,  ‘‘and ’Abdu-r-rahman was so much pleased that he praised highly his industry,  “ thanked him for his zeal, made him a considerable present, and ordered that  ‘more trees of the same kind should be planted in the Rissdfah as well as in  “ other of his pleasure-gardens. Safar on his side augmented also his plantation,     CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 211    “ distributed the seed among his friends, and the Andalusian gardeners began  “every where to cultivate this fruit, which is to this day the best kind of  “pomegranate that exists, and is still known by the name of its introducer,  “ Safari.” 3?   But to returr to the palace of the Riss4fah, which ’Abdu-r-rahman ornamented  with costly magnificence, and to which he conveyed water from the distant  mountains. We find that it was situate to the north of Cordova, and that when  *Abdu-r-rahman built it he called it Munyatu-r-rissdfah (the pleasure-gardens  of the Rissdfah,)** after a palace of a similar name which his grandfather Hisham  had built in Damascus. ’Abdu-r-rahmd4n was moreover exceedingly fond of it,  and he used to dwell in it for the greatest part of the year, an inclination in  which his grandfather Hisham had likewise considerably indulged. Nor was  this the only palace built by ’Abdu-r-rahmén or his successors; there were  besides in Cordova several royal villas remarkable either for the magnificence  of their structure or their delightful situation. Of this number were “the palace  of the confluent ” (Kasru-l-hdjiri) ;* ‘the palace of the garden” (Kasru-r-  raudhat) ; ‘‘the palace of the flowers” (Kasru-s-adhiru) ; ‘‘the palace of the  lovers”? (Kasru-l-ma’shik) ; ‘‘ the palace of the fortunate” (Kasru-l-mubdrik) ;  “ the palace of Rustak” (Kasru-r-rustak) ; ‘the palace of contentment” (Kasru-  s-sorrir) ; ‘the palace of the diadem” (Kasru-t-tdj); and ‘‘ the palace of the  novelties ” (Kasru-l-badiyi’).   Without the city was the palace of Sidi Abii Yahya Ibn Abi Ya’ktb Ibn ’Abdi-  l-mimen,* built on arches on the Guadalquivir. Its founder being once asked  how he, who had such an aversion to the people of Cordova, could take delight  in building this palace, replied, that knowing how soon a governor was forgotten  by them after his removal unless he showed them proofs of power and authority,  having their heads full of the splendour of the Khalifate during the dynasty of  Merwan, he wished to leave behind him some memorial of his stay which would  make the inhabitants remember him in spite of themselves.   Another palace called Dimashk is mentioned by Al-fat’h in his Kaldyid, when  Writing the life of the Wizir Ibn ""Ammar. He describes it as a pleasure-house  belonging to the Sultans of the house of Merwdn, the roofs of which were supported  by beautiful marble columns, and the floors paved with mosaic of a thousand hues.   “ All palaces in the world are nothing when compared to that of Dimashk,  “for not only it has gardens filled with the most delicious fruits and sweet-  “ smelling flowers,   “ Beautiful prospects, and limpid running waters, clouds pregnant with  “ aromatic dew, and lofty buildings ;     Bridges on the  Guadalquivir.    212 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    “ But its earth is always perfumed, for morning pours on it her grey amber  ‘and night her black musk.” *”   Another pleasure-house in Cordova was <Al-mus‘hafiyyah, so called from its  proprietor the Wizir and Hajib Abi ’Othmén Ja’far Ibn ’Othmén Al-mus‘hafi,**  who held the situation of prime minister under the Sultén Al-hakem Al-mustanser-  billah.   Munyat-Zubeyr was the name of another pleasure-house in the outskirts of  Cordova, which Zubeyr Ibn ’Omar Al-mulaththam® built for himself during his  government of that city. There were besides several other gardens and pleasure-  houses in Cordova called Munyat ; as, for instance, Munyatu-sorrir (the garden of  contentment), of which mention has already been made, Munyatu-l-’a’miriyyah (the  garden of the Beni ’A’mir), and Munyatu-n-na’trah* (the garden of the water-wheel).   The poet Al-walid Ibn Zeydtn, in a poetical composition in which he enumerates  the palaces, gardens, and places of recreation which existed in Cordova in his time,  has preserved us the names of some, such as the Kasru-l-fdrist (the palace of the  Persian),*! and Merju-n-nadhtr (the golden meadow),‘? a pleasure-garden in the  outskirts of Cordova. There were, besides, various other villas, promenades, and  plantations, for the use and recreation of the inhabitants. Of this number seem to  have been Merju-l-khor (the meadow of the murmuring waters),‘* Fahssu-s-sorrdk  (the field of the thieves), and Fahssu-s-sudd (the field of the dam),** all places  which Ibnu Sa’id mentions on the authority of his father. The latter, that author  says, was the same as that known by the name of Fahssu-l-ardht (the field of the  mills), which is mentioned by Kasim Ibn ’Abtd Ar-riydhi.**   The river Guadalquivir is less at Cordova than at Seville, this being the reason  why stone bridges were thrown over it at the former place, while the latter had  none. This river has its origin in the mountains of Segura,‘? whence, dividing  itself into two streams, one flows eastwards to Murcia, the other to Cordova and  Seville. Ar-razi, describing this river, says that it flows as placidly as a stream of  milk, and that even when its waters are increased by rain it is, at Cordova, a most  harmless river ; not so at Seville, where it has often threatened destruction to the  city, and death to the inhabitants. The same’ author describes the bridge at  Cordova as one of the most magnificent structures in all Andalus. It consisted  of seventeen arches, each arch being fifty spans in width, and the intermediate space  between the arches being also fifty spans. According to Ibnu Hayyan it was built  by As-samh Ibn Malik Al-khaulanj, governor of Andalus ; or, as the author of the  Minhdju-l-fakr says, by his successor ’Abdu-r-rahman Ibn ’Obeydillah Al-ghafeki,  at the instance of the Khalif ""Omar, son of ’Abdu-l-’aziz.4* It was afterwards  rebuilt and beautified by the Khalifs of the house of Merwdn. However, the     cHaP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 213    opinion given by Ibnu Hayy4n seems the most probable, namely, that there was an  old bridge at the same place, built about two hundred years before the invasion of  the Arabs ; but its arches being broken down and its upper works demolished by  time, only the foundations remaining, the governor As-samh ordered a new bridge  to be built in the year one hundred and one of the Hijra (a.p. 719-20), on the  still remaining piers of the former one. The length of this bridge is stated by Ibnu  Hayyén at eight hundred cubits, and the breadth at twenty; the elevation was  sixty cubits ; it stood upon eighteen arches (one more than Ar-rézi gave), and had  besides sixteen turrets. The old bridge is said by Ibnu Hayydn, Ar-razi, and  Al-hijari, to have been built by Octavius, the second Cesar of Rome, as we have  remarked elsewhere.   The number of villages and towns appertaining to Cordova was almost in- Jurstiction of  numerable, for at one time the jurisdiction of the capital extended over many  populous and wealthy districts. Some cities of the first rank likewise acknow-  ledged her authority; as Almodovar, distant sixteen miles; Mored, twenty-five ;  Alcozer, eighteen; Ghdfek, two days’ march; Ezija, thirty-six miles; Baena,  two days’ march ; Estepa, thirty-six miles: the city of Ronda belonged also to  Cordova, but it was afterwards annexed to that of Seville, to which city it stands  nearer. There were, moreover, in the neighbourhood of Cordova no less than three  thousand villages, provided with mosques, and having, besides, a divine (mukallass) ®  of known erudition, whose duty was to pronounce judgments on canon and civil  law. Among the Andalusian Arabs none could aspire to wear the kalass who could  not recite by heart most of the Mowattd, or who knew not ten thousand traditions  respecting the Prophet, or were not perfectly conversant with the theological work  entitled Al-madinah.©° It was the duty of the Kddis of villages in the neigh-  bourhood of Cordova to come to town every Friday, and assist at public prayers  with the Khalif in the great mosque; and when the prayers were over they all  approached the Sultan, saluted him, and reported on the state of their respective  towns.   The revenues arising from Cordova and. its district have been differently stated. Revenue.  They are said by an eastern writer to have amounted, in the days of Al-hakem, son  of Hisham, to one hundred and ten thousand and twenty dinars, in specie, four  thousand and seven hundred mudd of wheat and seven thousand seven hundred  and forty-seven of barley, in kind; another writer estimates them at three million  of dinars at a medium, under the administration of Al-manstr Ibn Abi ’A’mir.  But this latter computation is undoubtedly erroneous,—the revenues collected from  Cordova and its neighbourhood never rose to such a sum; the author must mean  the total amount of taxes collected in the dominions of the Khalifs; but again he     Productions of    the soil.

But God only is all-knowing.   One thing is certain, namely, that trade and agriculture flourished in this place  during the reigns of the sons of Umeyyah in a degree which has scarcely been wit-  nessed in any other city in the world; its market was always overstocked with the  fruits of the land, the productions of every district, and the best of every country.  No robe, however costly,—no drug, however scarce,—no jewel, however precious,—  no rarity,of distant and unknown lands, but was to be procured in the bazaars of  Cordova, and found hundreds of purchasers. Situate as Cordova was in the midst of ©  fertile lands watered by the Guadalquivir, and which yielded abundant crops, its  inhabitants were at all times provided with the best food of all kinds, and that, too,  at the cheapest possible rate. Ibnu Sa’id calls the land about Cordova a favoured  land, and mentions several minerals in which its territory abounded, such as pure  silver in the district of Kartash,®' quicksilver and cinnabar in that of Sittdlisah,5?  and a great many other precious minerals. Another writer mentions a sort of stone  called sharankh,® which is well known to possess the property of stopping the blood  when applied to a wound, and which is said to have abounded in the territory of  that city. Our author observes that mule-loads of it were annually exported to  other countries, where it often fetched as high a price as five hundred dinars the  load, on account of its wonderful properties, which made it very much prized.   We have already said something elsewhere on the probable size and extent of  Cordova during the times of its greatest prosperity ; indeed it is ascertained that  during the administration of the Hajib Al-manstir such was the influx of popu-  lation, that, what with the innumerable foreigners who came from all parts of the  Mohammedan world to reside in it under the shade of his justice, and what with the  motley tribes of Berbers which he called from Africa, and with whom he reduced to  the last extremity the miserable relics of the Christian nations, the limits of Cor-  dova were found insufficient to contain them all, and many had to live encamped  under tents in the outskirts of the city. A trustworthy writer who was residing in  Cordova at the time tells us,—‘ I once counted all the houses in the city and  ‘its suburbs, and found they amounted to two hundred thousand and seventy-  “ seven, including only in this number those of the common people, artisans, and  “Jabourers ; for the palaces of the nobles, Wizirs, officers of the royal household,  “* commanders of the troops, and other wealthy citizens, and the barracks, hos-  “* pitals, colleges, and other public buildings, amounted to sixty thousand and three  “ hundred, exclusive of wooden cabins,® inns, baths, and taverns.” The number  of shops®® at this time is computed by the same author at eighty thousand four  hundred and fifty-five. Another writer states the number of markets to have been     CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 215    four thousand and three hundred, and says that within the walls of the citadel there  were upwards of four hundred and thirty houses belonging to officers of the royal  household and public functionaries. The number of houses in the city and the  suburbs belonging either to the common people or to respectable and wealthy  citizens is computed by the same writer at one hundred and thirteen thousand,  exclusive of the palaces inhabited by Wizirs, noblemen, and military commanders.  But we have read somewhere else that the said number must only be applied to the  times of the Sultans of the Beni Lamtumnah (Almoravides) and the Almohades their  successors, under whose reign the importance and splendour of Cordova were very  much diminished, owing to the disastrous civil wars which raged through its terri-  tory ; for, as we have remarked elsewhere, the number of houses occupied by officers  of the state and noble and distinguished citizens amounted to sixty thousand and  three hundred. The number of mosques in and without the capital is likewise stated  with great discrepancy. An ancient writer states those that existed under ’Abdu-r-  rahmén I. at four hundred and ninety ; it is true that this number was prodigiously*”  increased in the course of time. The author of the Kitdbu-l-mesdlek wa-l-memdlek  states them likewise at four hundred and seventy-one. We have seen their number  estimated even as high as eight hundred and thirty-seven,®* but this must be an  exaggeration ; the baths in and without the city are by some said to have amounted  to three hundred, by others they are computed at seven hundred. The suburbs  also are said to have been twenty-eight in number,—others reduce them to twenty ;  but the number given by Ibnu Bashkiwél, that is, twenty-one, occurs more fre-  quently in the writings of the time. :   However, the numbers as given by Ibnu Sa’id, a writer on whom we place the  most implicit trust and reliance, and who borrowed his information from Ibnu  Hayy4n and other historians who lived in the prosperous times of the Cordovan  Khalifate, are the following: one hundred and thirteen thousand houses for the  common people, besides half that number, or perhaps more, for the officers of the  state, favourites of the court, military commanders, and the like. The number of  mosques at the period of its greatest splendour, namely, during the administration  of the Wizir Ibn Abi ’A’mir, never exceeded seven hundred, nor the baths nine  hundred ; but he owns having read in an ancient history that under ’Abdu-r-  rahmén III. the city of Cordova was reported to contain three hundred thousand  houses, and eight hundred and eighty-seven mosques, eighteen of which were within  the limits of Shakandah ; yet the number given by Al-bekri (that is, four hundred  and seventy-seven mosques,) is still far from any of those before stated. One thing,  however, is certain, namely, that during the civil wars which broke out at the  beginning of the fourth century of the Hijra, not only was a great part of these     216 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book m1.    buildings demolished, and whole streets deserted, but some of the suburbs were razed  to the ground, and all traces of them disappeared for ever.   But it is full time that we should treat of the great mosque of Cordova, that  magnificent building which has not its equal in the whole world, either in point of  size, beauty of design, tasteful arrangement of its ornaments, or boldness of execu-  tion. This superb building has been so often and so elegantly described that we  shall merely select, among the written accounts that exist of it, that which we deem  indispensable for our narrative.",book_3,chapter_1

Tue great mosque of Cordova, as is well known, owes its erection to ’Abdu-r- ellie  rahman Ad-dakhel, the first sovereign of the house of Umeyyah who reigned Cordova.  independently over Andalus. All historians agree in saying that the moment  *Abdu-r-rahman saw himself free from rivals, and firmly established on his throne,   he began the building of the royal palace,—that of the pleasure-house called Rissdfah,   which we have before described,— and that of the great mosque. He died, however,  without seeing the building completed, and bequeathed to his son and heir, Hisham,   the care of the undertaking. Under this Sult4n the building was, properly speaking,  finished according to the original plan, but during the reign of the succeeding  Sultans and Khalifs, eight in number, who ruled over Andalus, it was considerably  augmented and embellished.   The causes which led to the erection of this magnificent temple are thus related Bullt on the ©  by the historian Ar-rézi. ‘‘ The conquerors of Andalus imitated the conduct of tian temple.  “Obeyd Ibnu-l-jerréh and Khdled Ibnu-l-walid' in dividing with the Christians  “the churches of the subdued cities, agreeably to the advice of the Khalif ""Omar  “ Tonu-l-khattéb. So when Damascus was taken the principal temple of that  “ city was divided, half of it remaining in the hands of the inhabitants for all pur-   “* poses of their worship, while the other half was appropriated for the use of the  “ Moslems, who converted it into a mosque ; the same being done in every city which  “surrendered by capitulation. According to this maxim, when the Arabs took  “Cordova they divided with the Christians their principal church, which was  “ within the city and close to the walls, and was known among them as the church  “ of St. Vincent.? In the moiety allotted to them the Moslems built themselves a  “* mosque for the prayers of the Friday, whilst the other half remained in the bands  VOL.

The Moslems  ‘‘ remained for a long time satisfied with what they possessed, until their number  “increasing daily, and Cordova becoming a very populous city, owing to the  “ Arabian Amirs having taken up their abode in it and made it the seat of the  “ government, the mosque proved to be too small to contain them all, and roof  “ after roof® was built in order to make it more roomy and spacious, until from the  “ contiguity of these roofs one to another, the narrowness of the doors leading to it,  ‘‘ and the great number of wooden pillars supporting each addition, which barred  “ the passage, it became a matter of the greatest difficulty to penetrate into the  “ interior of the mosque ; besides, the roof of each successive addition being inferior  “ to the preceding, that of the last was in fact so low as almost to touch the ground  “ and to prevent the people from standing at ease under it.   Began by ‘Abe ‘“« The mosque, however, continued for a long time in this state, until the arrival  “ of ’Abdu-r-rahman, son of Mu’awiyeh, surnamed Ad-dakhel, who, having gained  ‘ possession of Andalus, and made Cordova his capital, began seriously to think of  “ enlarging the limits of the mosque. Accordingly he sent for the chiefs of the  “ Christians, and proposed to purchase from them that part of the mosque which  “ remained still in their hands, in order that he might add it to the Mohammedan  ‘* pléce of worship. But notwithstanding the liberality of ’Abdu-r-rahman, who  “ offered them a very considerable sum of money, the Christians, relying on the  “ capitulations of peace signed to them by the conquerors, would not agree to sell  “their part. However, after much negotiation, they agreed to relinquish their own  “ half, on condition of being allowed to rebuild or repair another church outside the  ‘¢ walls, which had been destroyed, and of holding it independently of the Moslems, and  “ entirely consecrated to the worship of their God. This being granted by ’Abdu-r-  “ rahmén, and the Christians having received the sum agreed upon, which a certain  “ historian has stated at one hundred thousand dinars, the Sultén proceeded in the  “ year one hundred and sixty-eight* of the Hijra (a. p. 784-5) to demolish the old  ‘« place of worship, and to lay on it the foundations of the great mosque,’ which  “ became one of the wonders of the world. In this building, which was carried  “on with incredible activity during his reign, ’Abdu-r-rahmén is said to have  “spent the sum of eighty thousand dinars, derived from the fifth of the spoil.”  However, as we have remarked elsewhere, the building was not completed  until the days of his son Hisham, in the year one hundred and seventy-seven  of the Hijra (a. p. 793-4).   The poet Dihyah Mohammed Ibn Mohammed Al-balini® has alluded to this  in an excellent composition, of which we quote the following verses :     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 219    “ *Abdu-r-rahmén has spent, for the sake of his God and the honour of  “ religion, of silver and gold eighty thousand din4rs.   ‘* He has employed them in building a temple for the use of this devout  “ nation, and the better observance of the religion of the Prophet Mohammed.   “There thou wilt see the gold which covers its ceilings in profusion glitter  “« as brightly as the lightning crossing the clouds.”    —    Once completed by Hishém, the mosque of Cordova received considerable im- Continued by    provement at the hands of his successors ; indeed, it can be safely advanced that  none of the Sultans of the illustrious family of Umeyyah who reigned in Cordova  died without making some considerable addition, or contributing in some way to  the ornament of that sumptuous building. Hishém, son of ’Abdu-r-rahmén,  surnamed Ar-radhi, the same monarch who saw it completed, added considerably  to it, the expenses of the work being entirely defrayed out of the fifth of the  spoils taken from the infidels of Narbonne. His son, ’Abdu-r-rahmén al-ausatt  (the second), ordered the gilding of the columns and part of the walls,’ but died  before its termination. Mohammed, his successor, continued the work begun  by his father, and brought it to a close. His son, Al-mundhir, repaired several  rents in the walls, and made other material improvements in the building. The  Khalif An-ndssir caused the old minaret to be pulled down, and another magni-  ficent one to be erected in its stead. Al-hakem Al-mustanser-billah, son of  An-ndssir, made also important additions; seeing, on his coming to power, that  Cordova was every day increasing in size and extent, and the population rapidly  augmenting, and that notwithstanding the great additions made on various occasions  to the mosque it was still insufficient to hold the faithful that flocked to it on  Fridays, he directed all his attention to the enlargement of it, and succeeded after  great labour and expense in carrying his plan into execution and completing the  additional building known by his name ;—the expenses incurred by it having  amounted, according to the historian Ibnu Hayydn, to one hundred and sixty-one  thousand gold dinars, taken from the fifth of the spoils made from the infidels :—  by which the mosque reached the highest pitch of perfection, all these works being  executed in a manner which baffles all description. Lastly, in the reign of his  successor, Hishém II., and under the administration of his famous Hajib Ibn Abi  ’*Amir Al-mansir, a most important addition, built on a scale which left all those  of the Sultans, his predecessors, far behind in point of solidity, beauty of design,  and boldness of execution, was made to the body of the mosque. But as it is our  intention to treat at length and in detail of each of these additional works, we  shall not dwell any longer on the subject, and shall proceed to give the dimensions    his successors.     Its dimensions.    220 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    of the mosque, and to describe the works of art and precious objects amassed in  it by the commendable piety of so many sovereigns.   The author of the Majmu’-l-muftarik® says that the roof of the aisles ® before the  addition made by Al-hakem measured two hundred and twenty-five cubits in length  from jauf to kiblah,' and that the breadth from east to west was likewise before    the addition one hundred and five cubits. Al-hakem then added one hundred and    five cubits, thus making the entire length of the mosque three hundred and thirty  cubits. After this, Mohammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir, better known by the surname  of Al-manstr, added to it by order of the Khalif Hisham, son of Al-hakem,  eighty cubits in breadth on the eastern side. The number of aisles was at first  eleven ; the breadth of the central one being sixteen cubits; that of each of the  two next, east and west, fourteen cubits; and that of each of the remaining six,  eleven cubits. To this number Al-mansir added eight aisles of ten cubits in  breadth each, the addition being completed in the space of two years and a half,  during which time Al-mansir himself occasionally worked in person. The length  of the court"" from east to west was one hundred and twenty-eight cubits, and the  breadth from kiblah to jauf one hundred and five ; the width of the porticos of the  colonnade surrounding the court was ten cubits ; and the area of the whole building  measured thirty-three thousand one hundred and fifty square cubits.   Tbnu Sa’id, quoting Ibnu Bashkiwél, agrees in some particulars with the above  account. He states the length of the great mosque within the city at the same  number of cubits, that is, three hundred and thirty from jauf to kiblah; the  court or open space he only makes eighty cubits in length, the remainder being  occupied by porticos tiled over. He estimates the breadth of the mosque from  east to west at two hundred and fifty cubits, in which he is at variance with  the preceding statement.’2 He says also that the total number of aisles, com-  prising the addition made by Al-mansiir, was nineteen, and that they were called  al-baldttdt. The number of doors, great and small, was twenty-one; namely,  nine on the west side, including in the number a large one by which women  entered into the part of the mosque allotted to them; nine on the east, eight  of which were for the men and one for the women; three to the north, of  which two large ones were for the use of the men, and the other for the women  to enter into their recesses. No doors were visible on the south side, with  the exception of one in the south side of the makssirah, and leading through  a covered way to the palace of the Khalif. It was through this secret passage  that the Sultan passed on a Friday into the mosque to join in the public worship.  All these doors were covered with the finest brass, in the most beautiful manner.'®     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 221    Another author describes the doors as being only nine; namely, three opening  into the court,—one to the east, another to the west, and a third to the north; four  opening into the aisles, namely, two on the east and two on the west side; the  two remaining leading into the recesses for women under the aisles: and lastly, an  anonymous writer’* whom we consulted in Cairo says that each of these doors  was ornamented with a ring of exquisite workmanship, and covered with sheets  of yellow brass so bright and polished as to dazzle the eyes of the beholders.   According to the author of the Majmu’-l-muftarik the number of columns, all ~~  of marble, is said to have been one thousand two hundred and ninety-three ;  according to another writer the total number of columns which either supported  the roof of the mosque, or were embodied in the walls, or formed the domes,  or entered into the building of the minaret, amounted between large and small  to one thousand four hundred and seventeen ; others say that the large columns  in the interior of the mosque amounted to one thousand, exclusive of others of  smaller size in the court and offices of the mosque; but there are not wanting  authors who make their number still more considerable. Ibnu Bashkiwél, quoted  by Ibnu Sa’id, states them to be in all fourteen hundred and nine,’ of which one  hundred and nineteen were comprised within the maksstrah, built by Al-mansir.  This the above-mentioned author describes as one of the most magnificent and  bold structures ever raised by man. It extended across five aisles of the  eleven composing the addition built by Al-hakem, and its wings passed through  the remaining six, leaving three on each side ;'° its length from east to west was  seventy-five cubits; its breadth from the wooden partition to the columns of the  kiblah twenty-two cubits; the height, counting from the floor to the cornices,’”  eight cubits ; and that of the cornices three spans.   This makssirah was further provided with three doors of exquisite workmanship Makssirah.  and beautifully carved, and leading by the east, west, and north, into the body of  the mosque. It is stated elsewhere that one of these doors was made of pure gold,  as well as the walls of the mihrdb ; '* that the floor of the makssiirah was paved  with silver, and that all the parts adjacent to it were covered with sofeysafd'® (rich  mosaic work intermixed with gold) ; and lastly, that most of the columns, which  are described as being placed in clusters of four, and having only one capital, were  most beautifully carved and inlaid from top to bottom with gold and lapis-lazuli ;  but God only is all-knowing. It is also asserted that in the open space” occupied  by the mihrdb there were seven arches supported by columns, and rising to a con-  siderable height ; and such was the beauty of their proportions and the boldness of  the execution that both Christians and Moslems repeatedly expressed their admi-  ration at the manner in which they were achieved: there were besides in the two     Mihrab.    Copy of the  Koran written  by Othman.    222 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    jambs” forming the door of the mihrdb four columns of inestimable value,—two  were made of green marble, the other two of lapis-lazuli.   We learn from Ibnu Bashkiwél that the length of the mihrdb was eight cubits  and a half from kiblah to jauf, and its breadth from east to west seven cubits and  a half; the height of the dome thirteen cubits and a half. There stood against one  of its sides a pulpit,” also constructed by Al-hakem, and equalled by none other in  the world for workmanship and materials. It was built of ivory, and of the most  exquisite woods, such as ebony, sandal, bakam,® Indian plantain, citron wood,  aloe, and so forth, at the expense of thirty-five thousand seven hundred and five  dinars, three dirhems and one third ; and the steps by which it was ascended were  nine in number. Another writer says that it was formed of thirty-six thousand  small pieces of wood, which were fastened together with gold and silver nails, and  occasionally incrusted with precious stones, and that the original cost of each piece  was seven dirhems of silver ; that its construction lasted for seven years, eight artists  being daily employed in it, with an allowance of half a mithkél Mohammedi™ a day.   This pulpit was once the repository of a copy of the Koran written, as it is  generally supposed, by the Khalif ""Othman. It was preserved in a case of gold  tissue set with pearls and rubies, over which was a bag of the richest coloured silk,  the whole being placed on a stand of aloe wood, joined with gold nails. It was  taken to Africa by one of the Sulténs of the Beni ’Abdi-l-miimen, and lost and  recovered several times, until it was finally deposited in the great mosque called  Jémi’-Karawayin® (the mosque of the people of Cairw4n), at Fez. But this being  an interesting subject, and one which has given rise to much debate among the  learned, some of whom have expressed doubts of this book being so ancient  as it was supposed, we deem it proper to transcribe here the words of a very  intelligent author who has fully investigated the case. The Khattib Ibn Marzik*  says in his work entitled Al-masnadu-s-sahthu-l-hasan, (or collection of authen-  ticated traditions,) as follows:—‘‘ The copy of the Kordn called ’Othméni, and  “‘ which, according to Ibnu BashkiiwAl, is one of the four copies which the Khalif  “«’Othman (may God show him His favours !) sent to Mekka, Basrah, Kiifah, and  “* Damascus, is too well known all over Andalus and Africa to need description.  “ Tt was kept in the great mosque of Cordova, until on a Saturday, the eleventh of  “* Shawwal of the year five hundred and fifty-six of the Hijra (a.p. 1161), it was  ‘* taken away, as it is believed, by order of Abii Mohammed ’Abdu-l-mimen Ibn  “ °Ali,?7 and taken to Africa, where it remained in the hands of that Sult4n and his  ‘* successors, who not only took the greatest care of it, but carried it always in their    .“* travels and military expeditions, expecting that it would prove for them a source    ‘“‘ of prosperity. Thus it passed from one Sultan to another among the Almohades     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 223    “until it came to ’Ali Ibnu-l-maémin Abi-l-’ol4 Idris Ibnu-l-mansér, surnamed  “ Al-mu’atadhedh and Sa’id,* who took it with him in ms expedition against  “ Telemsfn, towards the end of the year six hundred and forty-five of the Hijra  “(a.p. 1247-8). By the death of this Sultan, who perished in a skirmish before  “ that city, the sacred volume went to his son Ibréhim,® who, having given battle  “ to the enemy, was also defeated and lost his life, the enemy getting possession of  “all the baggage of his army, and the greatest part of his treasures ; among which  “ was this Koran, which fell into the hands of the Arabs. What its final desti-  “nation was I could not learn; some say that it was acquired by the Sultan of  “ Telemsén, whose successor preserves it now in his treasure.   “ As to the supposition that some spots of the blood of *Othmén are to be seen  “on it, it is a very gratuitous one, and rests on no foundation whatever. That of  “ its being one of the copies presented by the Khalif to the cities of Mekka, Basrah,  “ Kufah, and Damascus, requires some consideration. Ibn ’Abdi-l-mdlik says, ‘ In  “ case of its being one of the above-mentioned copies, it cannot be any other than  “ the Syrian one.’ But Abd-l-késim An-najibi® As-sebtti tells us that the Syrian  “ copy, that is, the identical one presented by ’Othmén to the city of Damascus, is  “still preserved in the maksstirah of the mosque of the Beni Umeyyah in that  “city, where he saw it himself in the year six hundred and fifty-seven of the  “ Hijra.' It cannot either be that of Mekka, for the same Abi-l-k4sim informs us  “ that having in the said year of six hundred and fifty-seven (a.p. 1259) made his  “ pilgrimage to the holy places, he saw and read in it, and found it lying as before  “under the dome of the Jews, otherwise called Kubbatu-t-tarab (the dome of the  “ dust), and that he likewise saw the ancient copy preserved at Medina, and read in  “it. Perhaps it is the one of Kiifah, or that of Basrah ; but it is well known that  “the latter is preserved at Medina, where Abi-l-k4sim found it. Besides, An-  “ najaghi,°? who in the year seven hundred and five (a.p. 1305-6) had an oppor-  “tunity of seeing and comparing both copies, namely, that which is preserved in  “ Medina, and that which came to this country and was previously in the great  “mosque of Cordova, declares positively that he examined them both with the  “ greatest attention and care, and saw nothing which could lead him to suppose  “that the Cordovan one was of the same antiquity. The hand-writing was totally  “ distinct, the copy at Medina being written in the hand-writing generally used in  “Yemen, while that of Cordova was not. As to its being written by the Khalif  “?Othmaén himself, it is a supposition which scarcely needs refutation, for it is  “known to every body that he wrote none himself; what he did was merely to  “ intrust some of the companions of the Prophet with the revision and arrangement  “ of a copy which should serve as a standard for all others,—this being proved by     Tower.    224 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book 111.    “* the note at the end of the copy deposited now at Medina, and which reads thus :  ‘* « The present book was collected by some of the companions of the Prophet (on  “‘ whom be benediction and salutation !) by the injunctions of the Khalif Othman,’  “ &c. Then follow the names of the companions who assisted in the collection, as  “ Zeyd Ibn Thabit, Abdullah Ibn Zubeyr, Sa’id Al-’assi, and so forth.   “* However, be this as it may, one thing is-certain, namely, that the copy of the  “ Koran which was preserved at Cordova, and held in so great veneration by the  ‘* people of Andalus, passed through many hands, until it was lost before Telemsén  “by the Sult4én Ibr4him; its present destination being totally unknown to me,  “‘ unless, I repeat, it be preserved in the treasure of the Sultan of Telemsdn, as it  “* has been reported.”   Such is Ibn Marziik’s account, which we have copied almost literally from his  work. Now it remains for us to say that what Ibn Marzik conjectures is a fact ;  the sacred volume here alluded to remained in the possession of the Sultdéns of Te-  lemsan, who transmitted it as an inheritance from father to son, until that city was  taken by our Imém Abi-l-hasan™ towards the end of Ramadhan of the year seven  hundred and thirty-seven of the Hijra (a. p. 1336). That prince, having seized  upon all the treasures contained in the royal palace, found among other valuable  objects the famous Kordn, which he kept in his possession until it was again lost by  him in the disastrous battle of Tarifa ;*° thus becoming the prey of the infidel  monarchs of Andalus. From that country it went to Portugal, whence it was again  recovered in the year seven hundred and forty-five (a. p. 1344-5) by one of the  merchants of Azamor, who employed a ruse to gain possession of it. It then was  acquired by the Sultan of Fez, at which city Ibn Rashid saw it, as he himself  informs us in his travels.*   But to return to our description of the mosque of Cordova. ‘‘ The height of the  “ tower?’ now existing,” says Ibnu Bashkiwal, ‘‘ which was built by the Sultén  “*Abdu-r-rahman, son of the Sultén Mohammed, is seventy-two cubits, namely,  “* fifty-four to the top of the open dome, towards which the crier turns his back  “‘ when proclaiming the hour of prayers, and eighteen more to the very end of the  “spar. On the summit of this dome are the three celebrated apples, two of which  ‘“‘are made of pure gold, and the middle one of silver. Each of them measures  ‘ three spans and a half in circumference, and they are encompassed within two six-  “* petalled lilies in a most elegant manner, the whole being surmounted by a small  “ pomegranate made of pure gold, rising about a cubit above the top of the dome,  “‘ which is considered one of the wonders of the world.”   The building of this tower is thus related by the above-mentioned writer. ‘ In  ** the year three hundred and thirty-four® (a. p. 945-6) the Amir ’Abdu-r-rahmdn     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 225    ‘* ordered the old tower of the mosque to be pulled down, and the present mag-  “ nificent structure to be erected in its stead. The first thing done was to dig the  “ foundations, a work which lasted forty-three days, the excavation being carried so  ‘* deep that the workmen were stopped by water; the building was then begun, and  “ completed in the space of thirteen months, the material being free-stone cemented  ‘with mortar. When the whole building was completed, An-ndssir rode to the  “spot from his palace in the city of Az-zahr4, where he was residing at the time,  ‘‘ ascended to the top of the tower by one of its staircases, and came down by  “ the other ; for unlike the old tower, which had only one staircase, the present one  ‘is provided with two, separated by a wall of masonry, and so contrived that two  “ people starting at the same time may arrive at the top without meeting or seeing  “each other. After carefully inspecting the edifice, An-ndssir went into the  “ maksstirah of the mosque, prayed two reka’s, and retired.”   The number of steps in each staircase was one hundred and seven; and Ibnu  Bashktwal adds, that it was firmly believed in his time that the tower had not  its equal in point of height and beauty in any other of the countries subject to the  rule of Islam. But, as Ibnu Sa’id has very properly remarked, had Ibnu Bashkiwél  seen those of Seville and Morocco, both built by the Sultan Ya’kib Al-mansir, one  of the Beni ’Abdi-l-miimen, he would not have said so, since it is well known that  their dimensions considerably exceed those of the tower of Cordova. The height of  this, measured from below to the balcony or balustrade where the crier stands, is  fifty-four cubits, and to the very extremity of the spar, where the gold pomegranate  is, seventy-three cubits ; the width of each of the square sides, eighteen cubits ;—  thus making seventy-two cubits in circuit. The height of the tower at Morocco  is well known to be one hundred and ten cubits, and the width in proportion.   The expenses incurred by An-nassir in his addition to the mosque, as well as in  the construction of this tower, are stated by Ibnu Bashkiwal, who borrowed his  information from an account in the hand-writing of the Khalif himself,° at two  hundred and sixty-one thousand five hundred and thirty-seven dinérs, and two  dirhems and a half.   His son, Al-hakem, was no less fond of building, and his improvements and  additions to the mosque rank as high as those of any of his predecessors. As we  have related elsewhere, Al-hakem, soon after his accession to the throne, thought  of enlarging the mosque of Cordova, which had become too small to contain the  crowds of people that flocked to it on Fridays. While the addition was being built,  a dispute arose among his architects respecting the part of the horizon towards  which the kiblah was to be turned; some pretending that it ought to be built  facing the south, as it was formerly, and as his father, An-ndssir, had done with that   VOL.

While the people were  thus disputing the point among themselves, the Faquih Abi Ibrahim came up to  Al-hakem, and said to him, ‘‘ O Prince of the believers! all the people of this  ‘ nation have constantly turned their faces to the south while making their prayers ;  “ it was to the south that the Im4ms who preceded. thee, the doctors, the Kadis, and  “ all Moslems, directed their looks, from the times of the conquest up to the present  ‘‘ day; and it was to the south that the tdbi’s, like Misa Ibn Nosseyr and Hansh  “* As-san’dni, (may God show them mercy !) inclined the kiblahs of all the mosques  “ which they erected in this country. Remember that proverb which says, ‘ It is  “* preferable to follow the example of others and be saved, than to perish by  “ separating from the track.’” Upon which the Khalif exclaimed, ‘‘ By Allah,  “ thou sayst right! I am for following the example of the tdbi’s, whose opinion on  “ the subject is of great weight :”——and he ordered that it should be executed as  proposed.   Nor was this the only improvement which the Khalif Al-hakem made to the  great mosque ; he ordered, besides, some works of the greatest utility and import-  ance. Instead of the old reservoir*® for purification, in the court of the mosque,  which was supplied with water drawn by beasts*' from a neighbouring well, he built  four others at the two sides of the mosque, viz., two large ones for men at the eastern  angle, and two small ones for women at the western ; and these he filled by means  of a canal,‘? which, taking the water from the foot of the mountains of Cordova,  poured it into an immense reservoir lined with marble. The water ran night and  day, and what remained after supplying the wants of the mosque, being very sweet  and of excellent quality, was distributed into three canals,* parting from three  different sides of the mosque, east, north, and west, and flowed into two immense  fountains,“* which Al-hakem caused to be hewn out of the solid rock at the foot of  the mountains of Cordova at an enormous expense, owing to the number of work-  men employed in them, and the difficulty of transport.   The work was executed in the following manner :—Two immense blocks of stone  were first selected from the quarries in the mountains of Cordova; they were then  hewn out with pickaxes, an operation which took up considerable time, and when  every thing was completed both fountains appeared suddenly to the eyes of the  astonished multitude in the shape which they were destined to have. However,  the general satisfaction expressed by the inhabitants on this occasion was very  much damped by the obstacles, to all appearance insurmountable, which the distance  of the quarry and the size of the blocks presented to the transport and conveyance  of them by an inclined plane to the corners of the mosque prepared for their recep-     cuaP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 227    tion. This, however, was soon remedied, through the assistance of Almighty God,  and the following expedient was suggested. A cart was built with large beams  of oak wood placed upon a circular frame, the whole being strengthened with iron  hoops ; a road was levelled from the quarry to the mosque, and after every prepara-  tion had been made seventy of the strongest draught oxen were yoked to it by  means of strong ropes, and with God’s favour and assistance the two huge blocks  reached their destination one after the other, and were placed in the vaulted recesses  prepared for them,**—twelve consecutive days being the time spent in their  transport.    On the west side of this mosque Al-hakem built a house for the distribution of Ats-houses.    alms, in which such poor travellers and people as lost their way in the city, or did  not know whither to go, or were devoid of sufficient means to provide for their  wants during their residence in the capital, met always with a charitable reception,  and were hospitably entertained and furnished with every necessary, owing to the  vast sums with which the establishment was endowed by the Khalif. Several houses  for the poor were likewise erected by Al-hakem over against the great western gate  of the mosque.“® The sum spent by Al-hakem in the building of these houses, as  well as in his addition to the mosque, &c., amounted, according to Ibnu Hayyén, to  one hundred and sixty-one thousand gold dinérs, all derived from the fifths of the  spoil.   But the greatest addition that ever was made to the mosque is undoubtedly that  undertaken and completed in the days of Hishém II., and under the administration  of his famous Hajib, Al-mansir Ibn Abi ’A’mir. It is thus described by Ibnu Sa’id,  who quotes Ibnu Bashkiwél and Ibnu-l-faradhi as his authorities‘ The popula-  “tion of Cordova had so much increased,—owing to the great influx of people who  “came from all parts of Asia and Africa to settle in it, and to the tribes of Berbers  “‘ which Al-mansir drew from the opposite land and kept in his pay ;—the city  “itself had reached to such a pitch of magnificence and splendour,’ that the  “ suburbs and outskirts teemed with inhabitants, and the great mosque was found  “incapable of holding the faithful who flocked to it from all sides. As the  “Khalifs palace adjoined the mosque on the west side, Al-mansir could not  “extend the building except on the east. The first step he took was to indemnify,  “* preparatory to the building, the proprietors of such houses as were to be pulled  “ down with such sums as they chose to fix for their property. He called together  “ the owners of the houses, and addressing each of them in private he spoke thus :  “* Friend, I want that house of thine; I must buy it from thee, that I may add  “ its site to that of the great mosque: it is a work of great utility, and intended  “ for the convenience of the public. Thou mayst ask whatever price thou choosest    Al-mansiir's  addition.     Number of  chandeliers in  the mosque.    228 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    “* to have for it, and it shall be paid to thee out of the royal coffers.’ Every one  “* of the proprietors having agreed to sell his house, not without putting the highest  “* possible price on it, Al-manstir gave immediate orders for the payment, and com-  ‘* manded besides that a suitable residence should be built for each of the pro-  ‘* prietors in another quarter of the city. Al-mansiir addressed himself at length to  ‘* an old woman, who, being the proprietor of a house with a palm tree within the  “ court of the mosque,** obstinately refused to part with it for any sum, unless she  ‘* were provided with another house having also a palm tree; upon which Al-  ‘‘manstr issued immediate orders that the old woman’s wish should be fulfilled,  “* should it cost a beyt-mdl ;*° and, accordingly, another house with a palm tree was  ‘* procured for a most exorbitant price.   ‘* All these difficulties being speedily removed, Al-manstir began to build  ‘his addition, in aisles extending all along the mosque, as we have remarked  ‘* elsewhere,*° and the whole, when finished, presented a front of the greatest  ‘* solidity and elegance, the interior being decorated with gold in the most mag-  “ nificent manner; so that in the opinion of all the intelligent in these matters  “the addition built by Al-mansiir fell nowise short of those of any of his pre-  ‘‘ decessors, that of Al-hakem even not excepted :—the action being rendered still  “‘ more meritorious by the circumstance of Christian slaves*' from Castile and other  ‘ infidel countries working in chains at the building instead of the Moslems, thus  “ exalting the true religion and trampling down polytheism. Al-mansir built also  “ the great cistern under the court of the mosque,®? and it was he who first caused  ‘“« wax to be burnt in the interior in addition to oil, thus combining the effect of  “ both lights.”   The number of brazen chandeliers, of different sizes, in the.mosque, is computed  by some at two hundred and eighty, and by others at two hundred and twenty-four,  without counting those over the gates; and the number of cups containing the oil  at seven thousand four hundred and twenty-five, or according to other accounts at  ten thousand eight hundred and five. The leaden supporters® for the cups  weighed four arrobes, and three-fourths of a kintar* of cotton for the wicks of  the lamps were consumed each month of Ramadhén. The annual consumption of  oil amounted to one hundred and twenty-five kintars, half of which was used during  the Ramadhan ; and in this holy month three kintars of wax, and three-quarters of  a kintar of cotton thread used in preparing the wax, were requisite over and above  the usual allowance. The great wax taper which burned by the side of the Imém  weighed from fifty to sixty pounds ; it burned night and day throughout the month  of Ramadhan, and its materials both of wax and wick were so contrived that the  whole might be consumed on the last night of Ramadhén. The chandeliers were     CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 229    all made of brass and of different patterns, with the exception of three which were  of silver. Four greater than the rest were suspended in the central aisle; the  largest, which was of enormous dimensions, hung from the ceiling of the dome over  that part of the mosque where the Koréns were kept, and consisted, according to a  certain writer, of one thousand four hundred and fifty-four cups for lights. How-  ever, these large chandeliers, each of which consumed nightly seven arrobes or  quarters of a kintar of oil, were only lighted in the last ten days of the month of  Ramadhan. The total expenditure of oil in all the lamps® about the mosque,  including the addition built by Al-manstir, is by another writer estimated at one  thousand arrobes, or two hundred and fifty kintars, of which seven hundred and  fifty were consumed in the month of Ramadhén.   Tbnu Sa’id, who borrowed most of his information from Ibnu Bashktwél, gives  an estimate somewhat different from that of the former writers we have quoted,  although it nearly agrees with that of the latter. He says that the annual expen-  diture was one thousand and thirty arrobes of oil, (two hundred and fifty-one kintars  and one quarter,) five hundred of which were spent during Ramadhan, and that the  three silver chandeliers required seventy-two pounds weight of oil nightly, that is to  say, twenty-four each ; that the largest of all the lamps measured fifty spans in cir-  cumference, and held one thousand four hundred and eighty cups, the whole of which  were washed over with gold. Ibnu Sa’id being an author more deserving of credit  than any other of those who have written on the subject, not only on account of  the sources from which he derived his information, but also on account of his  veracity as an historian, we do not hesitate to adopt his computation. But God  only knows.*®   The number of people employed in or about the mosque, as the Im4m, the Attendants.  readers of the Korén, wardens, door-keepers, proclaimers of the hours of prayer,  lamp-lighters, and the like, is said to have been, in the days of Al-mansir, one  hundred and fifty-nine; but Ibnu Bashkiwa4l, whose account is entitled to more  credit, says that the attendants of all classes amounted to three hundred in the  times of the Khalifs,*” as well as under the administration of the Hajib Al-mansir.  He adds likewise that four ounces of ambergris, and eight of fresh aloe wood, were  burnt by way of incense on the last day of the month of Ramadhdn, although  Ibnu-l-faradhi, an author also entitled to great credit, states that one pound of  wood of aloes, and a quarter of a pound of amber, were allowed every Friday for a  similar purpose.   Our readers must have observed some discrepancy in the dimensions of this  Mosque, as well as in the number of columns, pillars, and chandeliers which it  is said to have contained, but this is owing either to the inequality of the measure     230 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    employed, the dhara’ cubit not being the same every where, or to the circumstance  that some authors only counted the detached columns, while others reckoned them  all, large and small, entire and half ;—that some described it before the great ad-  dition made by Al-mansir, while others, as Ibnu Sa’id, visited it as late as the  sixth century. In abridging the accounts of the various authors who have treated  on this mosque, we may have been guilty of repetition, yet, as we consider that  information may have been increased by it, and that we have been useful, this will  easily atone for our faults. God is great! in Him we place our trust !   ‘We cannot leave the description of this sumptuous building, and the enumeration  of the wonders of art contained in it, without taking notice of two or three circum-  stances which we have seen mentioned in Eastern authors, and which it may be  important to know, although no good authority is given for them. It is a current  opinion in Damascus, as well as in other cities of the East, that the mosque of  Cordova had three hundred and sixty arches, according to the number of days in the  year, and that the sun passed every day by one of the arches until it went round the  whole number, when it returned in the inverse direction.*® Among the authors that  we have quoted none has alluded to this; nay, we will say more, among the almost  innumerable Andalusian as well as African writers who have treated on this mosque,  none, that we know of, has made the least allusion to it; therefore the account,  from whoever it comes, is entitled to no credit ; for, we ask, is it probable that so  extraordinary a circumstance should have been passed in silence by writers who  have recorded facts of much less importance with the most scrupulous details ?   The author of the Nashaku-l-azhdr®® (sweet odour of the flowers) says that  among the manifold objects which by their exquisite workmanship or their costly  materials attracted the eyes of the beholder in the mosque of Cordova, there were  three red marble pillars, on which were engraved,—on one the name of Mohammed,  on the other Moses’ rod and the sleepers of the cave, and on the third Noah’s  crow ; and that the columns were not the work of man, but made by God, just as  they were. We again confess that we have looked in vain for information re-  specting this wonderful production of nature ; in vain have we perused and consulted  the best authenticated accounts of the time, and the most detailed description of the  mosque ; we have nowhere found the least mention made of it: we must therefore  pronounce it improbable ; for is it natural that the best and most diligent among  ancient writers should have omitted the fact, and that if the name of our holy  Prophet had been found impressed by the hand of the Almighty on one of the  columns of the temple this miraculous circumstance should have been left un-  noticed? But God is all-knowing.   There is still another circumstance told of the mosque of Cordova which we must     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 231    mention. It is recorded by that eminent writer, Ibnu Bashkiwaél, whose narrative  we have used so often ; but, being as devoid of foundation as the preceding, no great  reliance can be placed on it. That author introduces among his traditional stories  respecting Cordova the following :—‘‘ And they say that the site occupied by the  “ great mosque was formerly a great hollow, wherein the inhabitants used to throw  “ their offal, but that when Suleyman, son of Datid, (on whom be peace !) came to  “ Cordova and saw the spot, he said to the Jinn, ‘ Clear away this place for me,  “and transform it into a suitable ground, that you may afterwards build on it a  “temple for the worship of the Almighty God;’ and that the orders were obeyed,  “and the mosque built.” But this is contradictory of what we have stated elsewhere  respecting the Christian church, which, in the opinion of all writers, and of Ibnu  Bashktiw4l himself, stood on the site now occupied by the great mosque. The  same writer states that all the uniform ovals which are engraved on the ceiling of  the great mosque bore inscriptions appropriate to the spot, and calling the mind of  the faithful to contemplation and devotion.”   But let us proceed to the description of other magnificent buildings which em-  bellished the court of the Khalifs ; and first of all to that of the city of Az-zahra,  built by ’Abdu-r-rahmdén An-ndssir lidin-illah, the seventh Sultan of the dynasty of  Beni Umeyyah in Andalus.",book_3,chapter_2

City and pa- THe cause of the building of the city of Az-zahré is thus related by a certain doctor,  lace of Az- FI . UG : .   zahré. a native of Cordova. One of An-nassir’s concubines happening to die possessed of   considerable wealth, the Sultan ordered that the whole of her property should be   spent in the redemption of captives. A search was accordingly made in the country   of the Franks, but not one Moslem captive could be found; upon which An-ndssir   was greatly delighted, and thanked God for it. His mistress Az-zahraé, whom he   Cause of ite loved passionately, then said to him,—‘ Build with that money a city that may   "" “ take my name and be'mine:” and in compliance with her wish An-ndssir, who   surpassed his ancestors ’Abdu-r-rahman al-ausatt and Al-hakem I. in fondness for   building, began building at the foot of the mountain called Jebalu-l-’aris (the   mountain of the bride), south of the mountain and north of Cordova, the palace   and city which he called Medinatu-z-zahra after his mistress. This city, which   at first was only intended as a spot of recreation for his mistress, An-ndssir soon   took for his residence, making it also the abode of his guards and the officers   of his household; he built the palace of solid materials’ and beautiful design, and   ornamented the interior with costly magnificence, and he ordered also that a statue   of his mistress should be carved in relief over the gate. They say that when   Az-zahra sat for the first time in the great hall of the palace, and, looking out of   the windows, gazed with admiration on the beautiful snow-white buildings of the   city, contrasting with the black and dismal appearance of the mountain at the foot   of which it stood, she said to her royal spouse, ‘‘ See, O master ! how beautiful this   “* girl looks in the arms of yonder Ethiopian ;” on hearing which An-nassir gave   immediate orders for the removal of the mountain, but one of his counsellors   happening to be present when the order was issued said to him, ‘‘ O Prince of   “* the believers! God forbid that thou shouldst undertake a task the mere idea   “of which is sufficient to make a man lose his wit, for were all the men upon    ?     CHAP. I11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 233    “the face of the earth to be employed in cutting away its trees and excavating  “ its sides, no human force could move it from where it now stands. He only can  “do it who is the creator of all things.” This reason convinced An-néssir of  the impossibility of the task, and he ordered instead that all the oak and other  mountain trees which grew on it should be rooted up, and that fig and almond  trees should be planted in their place; by which change the landscape was so  much improved that the mountain became one of its finest ornaments, principally  in the spring, when the trees, being in full blossom, spread in the atmosphere a  fragrance and freshness that were quite delightful.   Medinatu-z-zahré was thus situate between the foot of the mountain and the  plain which extends to Cordova, at the distance of about three miles from the  furthest limits of the city. Ibn Khallekén, in his biography of illustrious men,  under the article of Al-mu’atamed Ibn ’Abbdd, King of Seville, has given the dimen-  sions of this wonderful city: his words are as follow. ‘“ The city of Az-zahré  “was one of the most splendid, most renowned, and most magnificent structures  “ever raised by man. It stood at the distance of four miles and a third from  “ Cordova; it measured two thousand seven hundred cubits in length from east  “ to west, and the breadth from north to south was one thousand seven hundred  “cubits. The number of columns in the building amounted to four thousand  “three hundred, and that of the doors to fifteen thousand.' In the raising of  “this sumptuous building An-n4ssir lavished countless treasures, since it is  “ reported that the revenues of Andalus, in the days of this Sult4n, amounted  “to five millions four hundred and eighty thousand gold dinars, collected from  “taxes; besides seven hundred and sixty-five thousand derived from markets:  “ exclusive also of the fifth of the spoil taken from the enemy, and the capitation  “ tax levied on Christians and Jews living in the Moslem dominions, the amount  “of which is said to have equalled all the rest. Of this vast income An-ndssir  “appropriated one-third to the payment of the army, one-third was deposited in  “ the royal coffers to cover the expenses of his household, and the remainder was  “spent yearly in the construction of Az-zahra and such other buildings as were  “ erected under his reign.” ? Such are the words of Ibn Khallek4n, who derived  his information from Ibnu Bashkiwél and other Andalusian historians.   Others assert that the expenditure was as follows. The number of workmen  and slaves daily labouring at the building was ten thousand ;—the number of mules  and other beasts of burden® constantly employed in the transport of the materials  fifteen hundred, or, according to others, fourteen hundred mules and four  hundred camels belonging to the Khalif, and one thousand mules hired for the  occasion, at the rate of three mithkals a month each. Eleven hundred burdens   VOL. I. 2n    Expenditare.     Materials used  in its erection.    234 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book m1.    of lime and gypsum were conveyed every third day for the use of the building.  The daily pay of one part of the men was one dirhem and a half each, others  received two dirhems and one-third. Six thousand blocks of stone made com-  pletely even and smooth were used every day, without including in this number  the uncut stones, bricks, and the like.   But as we are indebted to the historian Ibnu Hayydn for a minute description of  this magnificent construction, as also for an account of the materials used in the  building and the expenditure incurred by it, we shall extract its contents. It  is but proper to observe that this excellent historian held his information from  the mouth of Ibn Dahin, who had it from Moslemah Ibn ’Abdillah the architect  and geometrician, who lived in the reign of An-ndssir. ‘‘ An-ndssir began the  “ construction of the palace and city of Az-zahré in the year three hundred and  “ twenty-five of the Hijra (a. p. 936-7), and the building was continued for  “ forty consecutive years, that is to say, twenty-five years of the life of An-ndssir  ‘* and fifteen of that of his son and successor, Al-hakem ; for although the palace  ‘“‘ was completed long before the death of An-nassir, considerable additions were  ‘made to it by his son, and the buildings for the reception of the court, the  “barracks for the troops, the pleasure-gardens, baths, fountains, and so forth,  “were never completed until the days of Al-hakem. During the reign of ’Ab-  “du-r-rahman six thousand blocks of stone, great and small, cut into various  “ shapes, and either polished or smoothed, were used every day, exclusive of the  “uncut stones used for paving‘ and the like. The number of beasts of burden  ‘« daily employed to convey the materials of construction was fourteen hundred,  ‘* some say more, besides four hundred camels belonging to the Sultén, and one  ‘thousand mules hired for the occasion at the rate of three mithkals a month,  “* making the total expense of hiring amount to three thousand mithkals monthly.    ' “Jn the building eleven hundred burdens of lime and gypsum were used every    “third day. The number of columns, great and small, supporters or supported,  ‘employed in the building amounted to four thousand ; others exceed that  “number by three hundred and sixteen. Of these some came from Rome,,’  “‘ nineteen from the country of the Franks,’ one hundred and forty were pre-  “sented by the emperor of Constantinople, one thousand and thirteen, mostly  ‘* of green and rose coloured marble, were brought from Carthage, Tunis, Isfakis  ‘« (Sfax), and other places in Africa ; the remainder were extracted from quarries in  “his Andalusian dominions, as for instance the white marble from Tarragona and  “ Almeria, the streaked marble® from Raya, and so forth. I was told by Ibn  “« Dahin, who had it from the son of one of the architects employed by An-ndssir,  ‘that the persons commissioned to transport the marbles from Africa were three,     CHAP. I11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 235    “ namely, Abdullah the inspector of the works, Hasan Ibn Mohammed, and ’Ali  “ Ton Ja’far, a native of Alexandria, hesides Ibn Yiinis the sailor, and that An-ndssir  “paid them for every block or pillar of marble, whether great or small, which  “they transported to Cordova, ten gold dinars. I have likewise from good  “authority that the cost of each block of marble, whether great or small, found  “in the mountains of Andalus was also nearly the above-mentioned sum; and,  “lastly, it has been repeated on the authority of one of the servants of the  “palace that the total amount of the expenses in the erection of Az-zahra  “amounted yearly to three hundred thousand dinars during the twenty-five  “ years it was building under An-ndssir, namely, from the year three hundred and  “ twenty-five, the epoch of its commencement, till that of three hundred and fifty,  “the time of the death of that Khalif; and that having made the computation  “of the total expenditure which that Sultén underwent he found it amount to  “ fifteen beyt-mdl.?’ The number of doors in the palace of Az-zahré amounted  “to fifteen thousand, counting each flap or fold as one, and all were covered  “ either with plates of iron or sheets of polished brass.” So far Ibnu Hayyén.  Another well informed writer says that the cost of every block of marble brought  to Cordova, either from the Khalif’s dominions in Andalus as well as in Africa, or  from various distant countries in the hands of the infidels, was ten gold dinars  each, exclusive of the expenses of detachment from the quarry and carving, and  exclusive also of the cost of the men and beasts employed in the transport. And  another writer asserts that the total amount of expenses in building the city of  Az-zahr4 was one hundred mudd full of dirhems of the measure used at Cordova ;  others say eighty mudd and seven kaftz of the same measure.® But as these authors  do not state whether this is to be understood merely of the constructions raised  in An-néssir’s time, or also of those continued by his son Al-hakem, no great  reliance can be placed on the calculations, especially when we consider the au-  thenticity of the sources whence Ibnu Hayy4n borrowed the preceding narrative.  But before proceeding any further we deem it necessary again to remind the  reader of the system of composition we have adopted for the present work, and  which renders it necessary that we should quote literally from the writings of  authors from every country and of every age, thereby falling at every step into  fastidious repetitions and unavoidable contradictions; for since it is not given to  every author to see things in their true light, or to select the best information,  some have themselves been led into error, and made hundreds fall after them,  while others are to this day like a bright lamp which guides the studious through  the intricate maze of antiquity. We, therefore, who have neither the talents  required for the task of historian, nor the books’ sufficient to select and compare     236 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    our information, have preferred this method of writing history; sometimes quoting  the very words, and at other times extracting the narrative, of authors, but seldom  introducing observations of our own, unless the contradiction be so glaring, or the  statement so uncommon, as to require it. We hope therefore that our reasons  for doing so will be justly appreciated, and that our readers will excuse us when-  ever we happen to fall into the above-mentioned errors.   The two foun- Among the wonders of Az-zahr4, says Ibnu Hayy4n, were two fountains, with a  their basins, so extraordinary in their shape, and so valuable for their exquisite  workmanship, that, in the opinion of that writer, they constituted the principal  ornament of the palace. The larger of the two, which was of gilt bronze, and  most beautifully carved with basso-relievo representing human figures, was brought  to the Khalif from Constantinople by Ahmed Al-yiindni (the Greek), and Rabi’ the  Bishop.'° As to the small one, which was of green marble, it was brought from  Syria by the said Ahmed, although others assert that it came likewise from  Constantinople with Rabi’. However, all agree in saying that such were the  taste of the designs on these fountains, and the magnificence of the materials,  as to make their value almost beyond estimation. The smaller one, above all,  appears to have been a real wonder of art. It was brought from place to place  until it reached the sea shore,"" when it was put on board a vessel and conveyed  to Andalus. When the Khalif received it he ordered it to be placed in the dor-  mitory of the eastern hall called Al-minis,7 and he fixed on it twelve figures  made of red gold, and set with pearls and other precious stones. The figures,  which were all made in the arsenal’ of Cordova, represented various animals ;  as for instance one was the likeness of a lion, having on one side an antelope,  and on the other a crocodile; opposite to these stood an eagle and a dragon ;  and on the two wings of the group a pigeon, a falcon,* a peacock, a hen, a  cock, a kite,'® and a vulture. They, moreover, were all ornamented with jewels,  and the water poured out from their mouths.   The hall of the Another of the wonders of Az-zahré was the hall called Kasru-l-kholafé (the hall  of the Khalifs), the roof of which was of gold and solid but transparent blocks of  marble of various colours, the walls being likewise of the same materials. In the  centre of this hall, or, according to some, on the top of the above-described foun-  tain, which is by them placed in this hall, was fixed the unique pearl presented to  An-nassir by the Greek emperor Leo,'* among other valuable objects. The tiles  that covered the roof of this magnificent hall were made of pure gold and silver,  and, according to Ibnu Bashkiwdl, there was in the centre of the room a large  basin filled with quicksilver; on each side of it eight doors fixed on arches’” of  ivory and ebony, ornamented with gold and precious stones of various kinds, resting     CHAP. I11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 237    upon pillars of variegated marble and transparent crystal. When the sun pene-  trated through these doors into the apartment, so strong was the action of its  rays upon the roof and walls of this. hall that the reflection only was sufficient to  deprive the beholders of sight. And when An-ndssir wished to frighten any of the  courtiers that sat with him, he had only to make a sign to one of his Sclavonians to  set the quicksilver in motion,!® and the whole room would look in an instant as if  it were traversed by flashes of lightning ; and the company would begin to tremble,  thinking that the room was moving away,—this sensation and their fears continuing  as long as the quicksilver was in motion. The abundance of quicksilver in Spain  made An-ndssir conceive the idea of employing it in the manner above described ;  and it was perhaps the effect produced by that mineral which led to the belief that  this hall was perpetually turning round and followed the course of the sun, or, as  others have it, that it moved round on the reservoir as on a pivot ;? and such  was An-ndssir’s care for this building that he would commit the superintendence of  it to none other but to his son and successor, Al-hakem. In one thing, however,  we find all authors agree, namely, that there never was built a more splendid hall  than this, either in the times preceding Isl4m or afterwards.   The mosque of'Az-zahré did not fall short of the rest of the building. Although Mosque in A:-  matchless in design and faultless in proportion, the whole structure was raised and  its interior arrangements completed in the space of forty-eight days, for An-ndssir  kept continually employed on it one thousand skilful workmen; of which three  hundred were masons, two hundred carpenters, and the remaining five hundred  bricklayers and mechanics of different kinds. It was a stupendous structure, most  beautifully finished in all its parts, and consisted of five aisles of wonderful fabric,  measuring thirty cubits® in length from kiblah to jauf, without the makssirah ;  the breadth of the central aisle was thirteen cubits from east to west, and that of  each of the remaining ones was twelve cubits. The whole building measured in  length from kiblah to jauf, exclusive of the makssirah, thirty cubits. The length  of the open court, from kiblah to jauf, was forty-three cubits, the whole of this  space being paved with marble flags of a reddish hue, very much resembling the  colour of wine. In the centre of this court stood a fountain which -poured out  limpid water for the use of the mosque. The entire length of the mosque from  kiblah to jauf, exclusive of the mihrdb, was ninety-seven cubits, and the breadth  from east to west fifty-nine. To this mosque was added a square tower, measuring  ten cubits at the base, and rising to the height of forty cubits. In the makssirah,  which was of wonderful construction and ornamented with costly magnificence, a  pulpit of extraordinary beauty and design was placed by the orders of An-nissir on  the very day that the mosque was completed, that is to say, on the twenty-third     238 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    day of Sha’bain of the year three hundred and twenty-nine of the Hijra (23rd  January, 941). On this day, which according to other writers was on the twenty-  second of the said month, and which happened to be a Friday, public prayers were  for the first time performed with great solemnity in this mosque. The Kddi who  officiated as Imém on this occasion was Abi ’Abdillah Ibn Abi ’Isa, An-ndssir  being present, as also the principal officers of the court. On the ensuing day the  Khalif attended a sermon which was preached by the same KAdi.   There were besides in Az-zahra two baths, one destined for the use of the officers  of the Sultén’s household and other servants attached to the palace, and the other  for the public ; and it was likewise provided with markets, inns, colleges, and other  public and private establishments.   We might go to a great length were we only to enumerate all the beauties,  natural as well as artificial, contained within the precincts of Az-zahra ;—the run-  ning streams, the limpid waters, the luxuriant gardens, the stately buildings for  the accommodation of the household guards, the magnificent palaces for the recep-  tion of all the high functionaries of the state ; the throng of soldiers, pages, eunuchs,  and slaves, of all nations and religions, sumptuously attired in robes of silk and  brocade, moving to and fro through its broad streets; or the crowds of judges,  Katibs, theologians, and poets, walking with becoming gravity through the  magnificent halls, spacious ante-rooms, and ample courts of the palace. The  number of male servants in the palace has been estimated at thirteen thousand  seven hundred and fifty, to whom the daily allowance of flesh meat, exclusive of  fowls and fish, was thirteen thousand pounds; the number of women of various  classes, comprising the harem of the Khalif, or waiting upon them, is said to have  amounted to six thousand three hundred and fourteen. The Sclavonian pages and  eunuchs were three thousand three hundred and fifty,—some say three thousand  three hundred and eighty-seven ;—to whom thirteen thousand pounds of flesh meat  were distributed daily, some receiving ten pounds each and some less, according to  their rank and station, exclusive of fowls, partridges, and birds of other sorts, game,  and fish; although there are not wanting authors who have computed the number  of Sclavonian servants employed in or about the palace at six thousand and eighty-  seven.?""_ The daily allowance of bread for the fish in the ponds of Az-zahr4 was  twelve thousand loaves, besides six kaftz of black pulse” which were every day  macerated in the waters. These and other particulars may be found at full length  in the histories of the time, and recorded by orators and poets who have exhausted  the mines of eloquence in their description: all agree that when this most beautiful  and magnificent palace was completed in the days of Al-hakem, all who saw it  owned that nothing similar to it could be found in the territories of Islam.     cHaP. I11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 239    Travellers from distant lands, men of all ranks and professions in life, following  various religions, princes, ambassadors, merchants, pilgrims, theologians, and poets,  who were conversant with edifices of this kind and had surveyed this, all agreed  that they had never seen in the course of their travels any thing that could be  compared to it; they said more, they confessed that they had never heard or  imagined in all the course of their lives of any building similar to this; and all the  Andalusian writers bear testimony that it was in their time the chief wonder which  travellers to Andalus in those ages desired to behold. Indeed, had this palace pos-  sessed nothing more than the terrace of polished marble overhanging the match-  less gardens, with the golden hall and the circular pavilion, and the works of art of  every sort and description ;—had it had nothing else to boast of but the masterly  workmanship of the structure, the solidity of its foundations, the boldness of the  design, the beauty of the proportions, the elegance of the ornaments, hangings, and  decorations, whether of transparent marble or glittering gold, the columns that  seemed from their symmetry and smoothness as if they had been turned by turning-  machines, the paintings that equalled the choicest gardens, the artificial lake  so solidly constructed, the cistern perpetually filled with clear and limpid water,  and the amazing fountains, with figures of living beings ;—no imagination, however  rich and fertile, could have formed an idea of it. Praise be ascribed to the  Almighty God, who allowed those contemptible creatures to design and build such  enchanting palaces as these, and who permitted them to inhabit them as a sort of  recompense in this. world, and in order that the faithful might be stimulated to  follow the path of virtue by the reflection that, charming and delightful as the plea-  sures enjoyed by their owners were, they were still very far from giving even a  remote idea of those reserved for the true believer in the celestial paradise! We  ehall further see how this abode of contentment and mirth, how this splendid and  magnificent city, how these renowned bowers and gardens, were afterwards con-  verted by the Berbers into places of desolation and ruin. There is no God but  God! the great ! the Almighty !   This naturally brings to our recollection the great palace which Al-mansir Ibn  Dhi-n-niin, King of Toledo, built in that city, and in the construction of which he is  said to have lavished countless treasures. He not only employed all the best artists  of his age, but he sent also for architects, geometricians, and painters, from distant  lands ; made them execute the most fantastic and wonderful works, and rewarded  their labours with the greatest munificence. Adjoining to his palace he planted a  most luxuriant garden, in which he made an artificial lake, and in the centre of this  he built a kiosk of stained glass, adorned with gold. His architect so contrived  this, that by certain geometrical rules the water of the lake was made to ascend to     240 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1.    the top of the dome over the kiosk, and then, dropping at both sides, join the waters  of the lake. In this room the Sultan could sit, untouched by the water, which fell  every where round him, and refreshed the air in the hot season ; sometimes, too,  wax tapers were lighted within the room, producing an admirable effect upon the  transparent walls of the kiosk. But of this more when we come to the narrative  of the Kings of Toledo.",book_3,chapter_3

Aw Andalusian historian has said that such were An-ndssir’s passion and taste for Aqueduct of  building that besides the erection of the magnificent palace that we have just de-  scribed, and the considerable additions made to the great mosque, he also undertook  and completed during his reign several public works for the improvement and orna-  ment of his capital. Of this number was a most magnificent aqueduct, which conveyed  excellent water from the mountains of Cordova to the palace of An-na’trah (the water-  wheel), in the western part of the city, by means of tubes geometrically arranged  over arches connected one with another. The waters thus conveyed, in admirable  order, and by dint of extraordinary science, were discharged into a vast reservoir,  on which was a colossal lion of wonderful workmanship, and so beautifully imitated  that the sight of it only was sufficient to cast fear into the hearts of the beholders,  and that none devised by the Sult4ns of former times had been seen equal to it,  either in likeness or in magnificence. It was covered with the purest gold, and  its two eyes were two jewels of inestimable value, which sent forth torrents of  light. The waters of the aqueduct entered into the hind part of this monster, and  then poured out from his mouth into the aforesaid basin, which circumstance,  united to the beautiful appearance of the animal, to its terrible and overawing  aspect, to the two eyes which shone forth as if they belonged to a human creature,  never failed altogether to produce the most extraordinary effect in the minds of  those who beheld it for the first time. After supplying this palace, and irrigating  with profusion every corner of its gardens, notwithstanding their great extent,  the superabundant water went to augment the Guadalquivir. Every author we  have consulted on the subject agrees in saying that this aqueduct, with the re-  servoir, and the figure pouring the water into it, must be considered as one of  the most amazing structures ever raised by man; for if we attend to the length of  VOL. I. 21     242 _ HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK 111.    it, to the unfavourable nature of the ground through which it was conducted, the  magnitude and solidity of the construction, the height of the piers over which the  water was made to flow, sometimes ascending, sometimes descending, we shall  scarcely find among the works of ancient kings which have reached us any thing to  be compared to it.’   Lee te The building of this aqueduct lasted fourteen months, counting from the day on  which the preparatory works in the mountains were commenced to that on which  the water began to flow over the arches, go into the lion, and then pour down  into the reservoir. This took place on a Thursday, the third of Jumdadi-]l-akhar ;  on the same day the Khalif An-ndssir invited to his palace of An-na’tirah a large  party of the most illustrious citizens of Cordova, and gave them a most splendid  entertainment ; after which he distributed considerable largesses among his guests,  and lavished all sorts of rich presents on the architects and geometricians who had  directed the work, although they had already been most munificently remunerated  from the royal treasury.?   Az-zhirah. We have to mention another palace and city built by the famous Hajib, Mo-  hammed Ibn Abi ’A’mir, commonly called Al-mansir, although information  respecting it is by no means so abundant with us as we should wish. We  know that it existed at some distance from Cordova on the banks of the Guadal-  quivir, and that it was a most splendid structure, second to none but the palace  of Az-zahr4, built by ’Abdu-r-rahmdn ; but, owing to the circumstance of its being  destroyed by the Berbers, soon after the death of its founder,> during the disastrous  civil wars which brought to the ground the tottering throne of the Khalifs, the  memory of it was soon effaced, and such particulars as have been handed down to  us give but few details. Indeed, there are not wanting authors who suppose that it  also was built by ’Abdu-r-rahman An-néssir, confounding it no doubt with Az-  zahra, and being led into error by the similarity of the names ;‘ but, as Ibnu Khaldin  has clearly shown, they were two distinct and separate cities ; and the fact is further  proved by the testimony of contemporary writers, as Ibnu Hayy4n and others:  they all agree that when Al-mansiir usurped the Khalifate, during the minority of  Hishdm, son of Al-hakem, he built for his own security and residence a palace,  whither he transferred his treasures, stores, and arms. The edifice, which stood  on the banks of the Guadalquivir, not far from Az-zahra, was begun in the year  three hundred and sixty-eight of the Hijra (a. p. 978-9), the greatest part of it  being completed in the short space of two years. Al-manstir betook himself to it,  with his family, servants, guards, and adherents, in the year three hundred and  seventy (a.p. 980-1). He, moreover, established in it the offices of the state,  built magazines for grain, and erected mills ; he also granted the adjoining lands to     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 243    his Wizirs, Kétibs, Generals, and favourites, who lost no time in building mag-  nificent houses and palaces, and planting gardens in the neighbourhood ; people of  all ranks and professions, anxious to fix their abodes near the ruler of the state,  imitated their example, and built all round, so that in a very short time the  suburbs of Az-zahirah joined those of Cordova.   I recollect having read in an historical work, the composition of the author of  the Kitdbu-l-azhdr wa-l-anwdr,> which I saw in the library of Fez, the following  anecdote respecting Al-manstr, and the splendour and magnificence with which he  used to surround his person while residing in his palace of Az-zdhirah. There  came once to the court of Al-manstir ambassadors from the most powerful of the  Christian kings of Andalus ; their object was to ascertain the real strength of the  Moslems, and gain, if possible, a knowledge of their internal affairs. No sooner did  Al-mansir hear of their arrival than he issued orders for their suitable enter-  tainment, and began to make preparations previous to their admission to his pre-  sence. He ordered that a vast lake, several miles in length, which was in the  gardens of Az-zdhirah, should be planted entirely with water-lilies ;° he then caused  four kintars of gold, and four kintars of silver, to be cast into as many small pieces  as there were water-lilies in the lake, and ordered that one of those pieces should  be introduced into the cavity of each water-lily. All this having been executed  agreeably to his instructions, Al-mansiir dispatched a messenger to the Christian  ambassadors, and bade them appear in his presence the next morning at dawn. The  Christians did as they were desired, and found Al-mansir sitting in the great hall of  his palace, in a balcony overlooking the lake ; at sunrise one thousand Sclavonians  dressed in silken robes embroidered with silver and gold, their waists being girt by  sashes of gold tissue, and carrying in their hands gold and silver trays, made their  appearance, and the ambassadors were very much struck to see the beauty of their -  personal appearance, the magnificence of their dresses and ornaments, and the  admirable order in which they drew themselves up on each side of Al-mansir’s  throne,—the five hundred with robes of gold tissue and gold trays to the right, and the  five hundred with robes of silver tissue and silver trays to the left. The Christians,  in the meanwhile, not knowing what was meant, were dumb with amazement ; but  when the first sunbeams shone upon the water-lilies in the lake, all the Sclavonians  left their ranks at a signal from their chief, hastened to the spot, and began plucking  the flowers, placing those that had the silver pieces inside in the gold trays, and  those that had the gold pieces in the silver trays, and when every water-lily on the  lake had thus been plucked and placed in the silver and gold trays, they appeared  again in the presence of Al-mansir, and deposited their gatherings at his feet, thus  raising a mountain of silver and gold before his throne. When the Christian     244 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 111.    ambassadors saw this, they were seized with astonishment, and remained deeply  convinced of Al-manstir’s immense resources and countless treasures; they  addressed him in the most humble terms, asked for a truce, which was granted,  and returned to their country, where they said to their king, ‘‘ Do not make war  “upon these people, for, by the Lord, we have seen the earth yielding them its  ‘* hidden treasures.”   It is related by Abi Idris Al-khauldni that as Al-manstr was one day sitting  in his palace of Az-zdhirah, reflecting on its beauties, listening to the murmur  of the running waters and to the songs of rare birds, inhaling the perfumes of  the scented flowers, and regaling his eyes with the emerald green of the bowers  and meadows,—as his whole soul in short was absorbed in the contemplation of  the manifold beauties surrounding him on every side,—suddenly tears rolled  down his cheeks, and he exclaimed, in deep sorrow, “‘O Az-zéhirah! may the  ‘* Almighty Lord save thee from the hands of the demon of war, who will ere  “‘long accomplish thy destruction!” and Al-manstr, after saying this, wept  bitterly and hid his face with both his hands. Then one of his favourites who  was present said to him, ‘‘ What ails thee, O Al-manstir? What words are these ?  ‘* What is the meaning of expressions which thy lips never uttered before ; and  “how comest thou to be assailed by thoughts so melancholy and sad as these,  “when the like of them never before entered thy mind?” ‘ God grant,” said  Al-manstr, ‘“‘ that my prediction be not fulfilled; for if my presentiments tell me  “ truth, the fire of civil discord will soon rage within the precincts of this palace,  ‘and all the beauties of Az-zéhirah will ere long be effaced,—all traces of it will  ‘« disappear from the face of the earth, this splendid mansion will be pulled down  “* and converted into a heap of ruins, the gardens transformed into a dreary desert,  ‘* my treasures will be squandered and scattered, and what was formerly the scene  “ of pleasure and mirth will be changed into a spot of desolation and ruin.”   Al-khauléni continues: ‘“ Alas! this prophecy of Al-manstir’s was speedily ful-  “ filled, as is well known; for his son Al-mudhfer, who after his death succeeded  “him in the command of the army and the management of public affairs, had  “‘ neither the abilities nor the popularity of his father, and the power of the  ‘ Khalifs began to decline. However, after the death of Al-mudhfer, whose  ‘administration did not last long, the reins of government were taken by his  “ brother ’Abdu-r-rahman, surnamed Sanjiil,”7 who was soon afterwards deposed and  “ put to death by a successful rebel, a prince of the royal blood, named Mohammed  “ Tbn Hishém Ibn ’Abdi-l-jabb4r, who afterwards assumed the honourable appella-  “tion of Al-muhdi-billah® (the directed by God). This Mohammed collected an  ‘ army in the provinces, marched against the capital, which he entered, and having     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 245    “ succeeded in securing the persons of ’Abdu-r-rahmén and of his principal par-  “ tisans, put them all to death. The rebels then repaired to Az-zéhirah, which  “ they levelled with the ground, as being the residence of the usurpers against whom  “ the war was raised. So this Al-muhdi, whom Al-mansir had not thought worthy  “his notice while he lived, not only cut off his lineage and snatched away the  “ empire from the hands of his posterity, but demolished the very edifices which he  “had erected. The power of the Beni ’A’mir. vanished for ever, and as a poet has  “ remarked,—  ‘ Hajin will no longer be As-safé’s faithful companion, the pilgrims will no  ‘ longer meet in Mekka to hold nightly confabulations.  ‘ Indeed, we ourselves shall perish, like the course of time and the passing  “ away of successive generations.’ ”®   Nor was the havoc and ruin confined to Az-zéhirah only. The same fate befel  Az-zahra and other palaces raised by the Beni Umeyyah, for during the civil com-  motions which disturbed the capital, and the struggles of the contending parties to  secure the empire, that splendid palace and city, where so many treasures had been  spent by ’Abdu-r-rahmén and by his son Al-hakem, was completely destroyed, and  vanished like evening ; the royal chambers were plundered of their costly furniture  and tapestry, every object of art was scattered, and the whole building transformed  into a heap of ruins; it is even asserted that many of the precious articles which  these palaces contained, such as arms, vases, jewels, and the like, were sold in  Baghdad and other cities of the East.’   Abi Nasr Al-fat’h says in his Matmah that the Wizir Hazm Ibn Jehwar”  happening once to pass with a friend of his by the palace of Az-zahrd, which in  his time had already been converted into a haunt of wild beasts, he pointed to it  and exclaimed,—   ““T once asked that house, whose inhabitants have now exterminated one  “ another,—where are thy owners, the eminent lords who ruled over us ?   “ And she answered me,—here they lived for a while, but they are now  “gone; they have vanished without my knowing where.” '?   They say also that a holy man who lived in those days, one of those austere and  pious Moslems whose thoughts are entirely consecrated to God, having once directed  his steps towards Az-z4hirah, when he came in sight of it was so much struck by  the magnificence and size of the building, the luxuriance and excellent arrangement  of the gardens, and the profusion of costly ornament and gilding lavished on it,  that he could not help exclaiming,— :   “* O palace of the kings! every house in this country has contributed to thy     246 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BooK 111.    “ ornament and perfection : thou shalt also (when in ruins) afford materials for  “* every house.” 8  Few days had elapsed since that pious and holy man had made his prayer when  all the treasures of Az-z4hirah were plundered and scattered over the country, and  the building itself was levelled with the ground, as we have previously stated,  in consequence of the horrid and disastrous civil war which soon arose in Andalus,  and from which no family or tribe escaped without contributing some victim.  Praise be ascribed to God, whose decrees are infallibly executed upon his creatures !  There is no God but Him! the high! the great !  pene ~The Christians, it appears, had likewise in Cordova a church to which pilgrims  came from distant lands. It was called Santa Maria, and was held by them in  great veneration and respect. They had besides, as Ibnu Hayyén relates, other  churches and chapels within and out of the city, and some monasteries in the  recesses of the neighbouring mountains, wherein their impious and abominable  rites were performed in the very faces of the Moslems. But their principal church  was the above-mentioned. The poet Ibn Shoheyd’® has preserved us the following  anecdote respecting this church. ‘I once entered at night,” says he, ‘“ into the  ‘« principal Christian church ; I found it all strewed with green branches of myrtle,  “ and planted with cypress trees.'° The noise of the thundering bells resounded in  “‘ my ears, the glare of the innumerable lamps dazzled my eyes ; the priests, decked  “in rich silken robes of gay and fanciful colours, girt by girdle cords,’” advanced  “to adore Jesus. Every one of those present had banished mirth from their  ** countenances, and expelled from their minds all agreeable ideas; and if they  “* directed their steps towards the marble font it was merely to take sips of water  “with the hollow of their hands. A priest then rose and stood among them, and  “‘ taking the wine-cup in his hands prepared to consecrate it; he applied to the  “liquor his parched lips, as dark as the dusky lips of a beautiful maid ;'* the  “ fragrancy of its contents captivated his senses, but when he had tasted the  “« delicious liquor, its sweetness and flavour seemed to overpower him.” On leaving  the church Ibn Shoheyd said extempore the following verses :  “ By the Lord of mercy! This mansion of God is pervaded with the smell  ‘ of the fermented red liquor, so pleasant to the youth.  “ It was to a girl’? that their prayers were addressed, it was for her that  “they put on their gay tunics instead of humiliating themselves before the  “« Almighty.  “ The priests, wishing us to stay long among them, began to sing round us  “ with their books ® in their hands ;     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 247    “< Every wretch presented us the palm of his withered hand (with the holy  “ water), but they were like the bat whose safety consists in his hatred for  “ light ;   “ Offering us every attraction that their drinking of new wine or their eating  “ of swine’s flesh can afford.” ”   It has been said that one of the great privileges enjoyed by this illustrious city |  was that its jurisdiction in certain legal and religious matters was long acknowledged  in the tribunals of Maghreb ; so much so that judges used to abstain from pro-  nouncing upon some legal points, saying—this belongs to the jurisdiction of Cordova.  As this subject, however, has been one of great dispute among the learned, we deem  it convenient to state here a few of the arguments produced in favour of or against  the proposition.   The Imam Ibn ’Orfah, (the mercy of God be upon him!) treating about the  conditions required from an Im4m who is to pronounce judgment in conformity  with one of the approved sects, says, ‘‘ And if both the parties concerned should  “ resist the judge’s sentence there are three ways of remedying it, namely, to have  “ recourse to the decisions of Al-b4ji,”* or to the jurisdictional tribunals of Cordova,  “ or to the civil law of Sahniin,® the judge still deciding in conformity with the sect  “he may follow from among the sects professed by the people of Medina.”   Al-marazi disputes the opinion delivered by Ibn ’Orfah ; he agrees as to the first  appeal being right, but he denies the second, and declares that it is one of the errors  propagated by At-tortoshi™ in his work treating on the legal regulations of the  people of Cordova, and adds that it is a gross mistake, exhibiting great ignorance on  the part of the author ; the third however he admits.   Ibn Gh4zi entertains the same opinion as Al-mérazi, and says that the whole error  originated in a mistake made by At-tortoshi and copied by Ibn ’Orfah. Another  author, Ibn Shas,” has also discussed this subject at full length ; but let us hear what  our lord and ancestor Sidi Abi ’Abdillah Al-makkari At-telemsdni, who was Kadi-  I-koda4 (chief of the Kédis) at Fez, says in his work entitled ‘‘ foundations of civil law  among the people of Cordova,” after treating this subject at large. ‘‘ These were the  “* duties incumbent upon the office of K4di in Andalus, whence they were introduced  “and generally adopted in this country (Africa), for while we were disputing with  “ each other for the jurisdiction of Medina, and decided for that of Kiéfah, owing to  “ its having been the residence of a greater number of the companions of the Prophet  “* and heads of the law, such as ’Ali, Ibn Mes’iid, and others, the people of Cordova  “ refused to acknowledge it, and decided in all matters without the assistance of the  “lawyers in those cities; but God has spared my life and I have seen wonderful  “* changes of fortune.    ity Tahoma of     248 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 11.    “ Alas! at the time I am writing Cordova and its inhabitants have been lost  ‘to the Moslems, and the vices of that capital have cast their ominous influence  ‘* over the rest of Andalus. And why ?—because Satan resolved to accomplish the  ‘* ruin of truth, and he obtained his purpose ; for the Deceiver ceased not tempting  ‘* and enticing its inhabitants until he succeeded in implanting in it some of the  “* appendages of idolatry, such as lamentations for the dead,” false pride, arrogance,  “ incredulity, slander, vanity, divination, astrology, chiromancy, the art of drawing  “omens from accidental causes,® and similar impious practices; besides the  “* swearing of oaths, the telling of lies, and the committing every description of sins,  “the calling each other by opprobrious nicknames, and various other abominable  ‘* practices which we are taught to avoid. Nor did the evil, when once it raged,  ‘ stop at Cordova, for it spread widely among the people of other cities as soon as  “ the power of the Sultans of Cordova passed into the hands of the kings of small  ‘ states.27 The evil increased so much that they even neglected to appoint a head  ** of the law,?° but took as a foundation the old customs, and in this manner the  ‘* love of poetry, eloquence, intonation, genealogy, and other sciences cultivated by  ‘the ancients, lost every charm for their hearts, and instead they gave all their  ‘* attention to studies condemned by the heads of the law.”   The Hafedh Ibn Ghazi, after quoting the preceding passage from the work of our  illustrious ancestor, says as follows. ‘‘ I was told by a trustworthy person whom  “Tonce met, that when the very learned doctor, Abi Yahya Ash-sherif At-telem-  ‘* sini, came to the court of Fez, and began to give public lectures in the new city”  “upon the art of commenting upon and explaining the Koran, the reigning Sultan,  “whose name was Abt Sa’id Al-merini Al-hafid, convoked the principal theolo-  ‘‘ gians of the place to a meeting in his palace, to discuss various points of law  ‘* about which Al-makkari entertained a different opinion from the rest of the pro-  “ fession ; and that, although the doctors had almost agreed among themselves to  “ repudiate and condemn his doctrines, they could not help saying when they heard  ‘‘ him express his opinion that he had not gone further in his doubts than other  “* famous theologians, as Ibn Roshd and his disciples, Al-mateyti, and others among  ‘* the people of Cordova.”   This is what we have thought fit to say about Cordova in the present Book. We  shall, however, occasionally return to the subject when we treat about the Khalifs  of the house of Umeyyah, who resided in it, making it the capital of their empire,  ornamenting it with splendid buildings, magnificent palaces, and stupendous works  of public utility. In this, as well as in the other Books, our narrative has been  borrowed from the best Andalusian as well as Eastern authors, sometimes tran-  scribing literally from their works, but mostly abridging and extracting their     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 249    accounts. In so doing we have endeavoured to select the most interesting as well  as the most faithful records, by choosing among the descriptions of Cordova, which  are to be met with in almost every book upon the history or topography of Andalus,  those that appeared to us most interesting and true.   We shall now proceed to write the narrative of the occupation of that country by  the Moslems, from the year ninety-two of the Hijra (a.p. 711), when it was first  subdued by the Berbers, commanded by Miisa’s freedmen, until the moment when  it pleased the Almighty God to chastise the sins of the Moslems, and to permit  that the impious Christian should put his foot upon their necks.  strength, nor power, but in God! the high! the great!

Al-hijéri, Ibnu Hayydn, and other writers, agree in saying that the first man who  entered Andalus with hostile intentions and deeds was Tarif, the. Berber, a freedman  of Misa Ibn Nosseyr, the same who afterwards gave his name to the Island of  Tarifa, situate on the strait. - He was helped in that expedition by Ily4n* the  Christian, Lord of Ceuta, who had conceived some animosity towards Roderic,®  King of Andalus. The number of troops engaged in this first expedition amounted  only to one hundred horsemen and four hundred foot. They crossed the strait in  four vessels, landed on the opposite shore in the month of Ramadhén of the year     CHAP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 251    ninety-one (July, a. p. 710), overran the country, and returned loaded with  spoil.   No sooner was Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, then governor of Africa, apprised of the  success of this first expedition, which, as we have already observed, took place in  the month of Ramadhan of the year ninety-one (July, a. p. 710), than he appointed  his freedman, Tarik Ibn Zey4d, to command another expedition against Andalus,  and sent him over in company with Iy4n, King of Ceuta. The landing of Tarif  and Térik has been differently related ; but as it is our intention to recount in  detail every one of these events, and we shall therefore have many opportunities to  return to the subject, we shall now proceed to examine the causes which are  generally believed to have given rise to the conquest.   TIbnu Hayyaén says, ‘‘ One of the principal causes of the conquest of Andalus was cae Gite  “the appointment of Miisa Ibn Nosseyr to the government of Africa and more  “ remote lands: this took place in the year seventy-eight of the Hijra (beginning  “ March, a.p. 697),® by the Khalif ’Abdu-l-malek Ibn Merwdn. Mhisa, whose  “ father, Nosseyr, had been a liberated slave of ’Abdu-l-’aziz, the Khalif’s brother,   “left the court of Damascus, followed only by a few volunteers, and arrived in  “Egypt; while there he collected together the Moslem troops which garrisoned  “ that province, and marched to take possession of his government.”   But this event is differently related by other historians. They say that Miisa was  not directly appointed by ’Abdu-l-malek, as before stated, but by ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn  Merwan,’ who then governed Egypt and Africa in the name of his brother ’Abdu-l-  malek Ibn Merwdn. Having received orders from the Khalif to send an army to  Africa, ’Abdu-1-’aziz, who knew Miisa’s talents and ability, gave him the command Apprintment  of it, and dispatched him to make war on the Berbers, and other nations which had  not yet been subdued. This, Al-homaydi states, took place in the year seventy-nine  (beginning March, a.p. 698), namely, one year after the date assigned by Ibnu Hayyan.   No sooner had Miisa arrived in Africa proper, than hearing that some of the Tks posses-  nations inhabiting the frontiers of Ss al-addnt (the nearest province of Stis) ® had government of  shaken off the yoke of Islim, he sent against them his own son ’Abdullah, who  soon returned with one hundred thousand captives. He sent Merwdén, another of  his sons, against the enemy in another quarter, and he also returned with one  hundred thousand captives. According to Al-leyth Ibn Sa’d the number of captives  taken in these two expeditions, commanded by the two sons of Miisa, must have  been still greater, since he asserts that the share of the Khalif amounted to sixty  thousand.’ But this is no doubt exaggerated, for we have read elsewhere that the  share belonging to the Khalif, being the fifth of the whole number, amounted only  to twenty thousand, although Misa is said to have sent him soon afterwards twenty     Severe drought    and famine.

But be this as it may, certain it is that the  Khalif Al-walid received from his general a prodigious number of Berber captives  taken in war, and that the historian As-sadfi states that the captives (remaining)  in the hands of Mtisa amounted to a number never before heard of in any of the  countries subject to the rule of Islam.’®   Owing to this cause, adds the historian last mentioned, most of the African cities  were depopulated, the fields remained without cultivation, and, a general drought  ensuing, the Moslems were exposed to a most dreadful famine, as well as to most  raging thirst. In this extremity Miisa ordered a general fast throughout his do-  minions, and enjoined that public prayers should be said by all the Moslems. He  also recommended alms-giving, and the practice of good and charitable actions, to  appease the wrath of heaven. He then ordered a general procession, and placing  himself at the head of his people, followed by their cattle and beasts of burden, he  entered far into the desert."" There he separated the mothers from the young ones,  and the cries and lamentations began, and he remained in the desert until noon-  time, when he ordered a general prayer ; and this being done, he preached the usual  sermon (khotbah) ;'? and some of the auditory having remarked that he had made  no mention whatever of the Khalif Al-walid, one man got up and said, ‘“ Why  ** didst thou not, O Misa! mention the Khalif in thy sermon?” To which Misa  replied, ‘‘ Because this is neither the moment nor the place to invoke any one but  “ Allah (may his name be exalted !)” No sooner did Misa speak these last words  than the rain began to fall in torrents, numerous streams oozed up through the  sands of the desert, and the men drank until their thirst was quenched.   After this, Mtisa went out against the Berbers, and pursued them far into their  native deserts, leaving wherever he went traces of his passage, killing numbers of  them, taking thousands of prisoners, and carrying on the work of havoc and de-  struction. He next penetrated into Sis al-addnt, where he met with no resistance  on the part of the inhabitants, who humbly besought him to grant them peace, and  embraced Isl4m. Those, however, who still persisted in their hostility against the  Moslems, Misa attacked in person, or by the various divisions of his army, defeated  them in the field, and stormed their towns ; and never ceased pushing his conquests  until he arrived before Tangiers,* the citadel of their country and the mother of  their cities, which he also besieged and took, obliging its inhabitants to embrace  Islam. ;   They say that Tangiers had never been taken by an enemy before the days of  Misa; and, once in the hands of the Moslems, it became one of their strongest  citadels.'*   The same historian from whom we have borrowed the preceding particulars adds     cuHapP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 253    that Misa next directed his arms against Ceuta, but that he had the greatest  difficulty in gaining possession of it, owing to its Lord, Ily4n the Christian, being a  shrewd and brave man.   When the nations inhabiting the dreary plains of Africa saw what had befallen Genera! svt. |  the Berbers of the coast and of the interior, they hastened to ask for peace and Bere.  place themselves under the obedience of Miisa, whom they solicited to enlist them  in the ranks of his army. Musa lent a favourable ear to their petitions, and gave  them generals to command them. He also appointed his‘ freedman Tarik Ibn  Zeyad, the Berber, (whom some authors make of the tribe of Sadf,) to be governor  of Tangiers and the neighbouring districts, and placed under his orders nineteen  thousand Berbers, well provided with arms, and every requisite store to carry on  the war. In order to instruct these Berbers in the duties of true religion, for they  had all been previously converted to Islam, and their conversion had been sincere,   Misa further left with them a few learned Arabs and theologians, to read and  explain to them the sacred words of the Koran, and instruct them in all and every  one of the duties enjoined by their new religion.'®   This arrangement being made, Muisa returned to Africa proper, and when on jy oamediates  looking round him he saw no more enemies to attack, no more nations to subdue, ""42!""  either among the Berbers or among the Greeks,!’—when he perceived that the  principal cities along the coast had all been taken,—he wrote to his freedman Térik,  who was governor of Tangiers, and ordered him to get himself and troops ready to  make an incursion into the opposite land of Andalus. In compliance with this  order from his master, T4rik put to sail from the port of Tangiers with twelve  thousand of the new converts, and landed at the foot of the mountain which  afterwards took his name on Monday, the fifth day of Rejeb, of the year ninety-two  of the Hijra (a.p. April 28th, 711).   We have said that Musa in person took the cities of Tangiers and Ceuta ;—the siege oy Come  contrary appears from the narrative of Al-khozeyni!” and other historians, who  attribute the conquest to Térik. They say that, having given to this general the  command of an army, he directed him against the nations inhabiting the northern  coast of Africa. Térik marched first against Tangiers, which he took; he then  directed his arms against certain districts which acknowledged the sway of the  Kings of Andalus, and the capital of which was Ceuta, a strongly fortified city.""° A  barbarian chief, named Ilyan, ruled as sovereign in it: he was a man of great  resolution and courage; having been on a former occasion attacked by Misa, he  not only bravely withstood the attack, but made a sally at the head of his best  troops and obliged that general to raise the siege.

King Wittiza the country and destroying the fields, thinking that he would thus reduce them by   oo to famine ; but this also proved unavailing, for Ghittishah (Wittiza),” who then   the besieged. reigned in Andalus, sent them reinforcements and provided them by means of his  fleet with all sorts of provisions and military stores. As long as Wittiza occupied  the throne of Andalus the garrison of Ceuta defended itself with the greatest  courage and perseverance, and fought valiantly for the preservation of their families  and liberty; but on the death of that monarch the state of affairs was entirely  changed, and, owing to the civil dissensions which soon arose among the Goths,  the Moslems were enabled not only to reduce such cities as still acknowledged their  sway in Africa, but to push their conquests into the very heart of Andalus.   Death of Wit- —-Wittiza left sons” behind him, but the Goths not being satisfied with them this  gave rise to much tumult and agitation, until they decided upon giving the crown  to a chief named Roderic, who, although he was not of the royal blood, belonged to  one of the principal families of the land, and was moreover known to be a brave   : and gallant soldier, and one much experienced in the affairs of the kingdom.   Usurpation of — Tbnu Hayydn, in his Muktabis,* gives some account of this Roderic. He agrees  that he was not a descendant from the kings who occupied the throne of Andalus  before him, but that he was a powerful and noble lord, much respected for his  talents and his courage, and that having formed a considerable party among the  people he succeeded in snatching the sceptre from the sons of King Wittiza.   Another writer says that when Wittiza died he left three sons, who being of  tender years were not deemed fit to govern the country, upon which their mother *  assumed the royal power, and, holding the reins of government, administered the  kingdom in their name,—Toledo continuing to be her residence as well as the  court of the empire. However, Roderic, who under the reign of her husband Wittiza  had commanded the cavalry, refused to acknowledge the authority of the widow-  queen, and, having created a rebellion in Cordova, seized on the empire.   Iyiny Lord of But let us hear the account of Abii Zeyd Ibn Khaldiin, who, after saying that  Andalus was in the hands of the Goths, and that their king at the time was called  Roderic, expresses himself in the following terms :—‘ Besides their kingdom of  ‘* Andalus the Goths had settlements beyond the sea, so that when Misa arrived  ‘in Africa they were in possession of large tracts of land along its northern shore.*  “« These they were at first enabled to defend on account of their holding Tangiers,  “‘ which was the key of the straits, and owing also to the narrowness of the sea  ‘“‘ which separates Andalus from Africa, and which enabled them to send reinforce-  “‘ ments wherever they were required, so as to keep those countries in obedience  “and defend them against the Arabs. A great many of the tribes inhabiting the  “ coast were therefore subject to them. Now in that part of the country which is     cuaP. 1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 255    “now called Jebdl Ghomdrah (the mountains of Gomera) * there was a king of  “ the Berbers 7” named Ily4n, who acknowledged himself a subject of the Gothic  “ monarchs, obeyed their sway, and followed their religion.» Africa was governed  “at the time by Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, a lieutenant of the Khalif Al-walid Ibn ’Abdi-l-  “ malek, who resided at Cairw4n, then the seat of the African governors. Under  “ that general the Moslem armies subdued the greatest part of Africa and carried  “the war to the extreme western frontiers, after which they penetrated into the  “ mountain districts about Tangiers, and opened themselves a passage until they  “reached the mouth of the straits, when King Ily4n, unable to withstand their  “ attacks, surrendered, and submitted himself to the sway of Islam. Mbisa Ibn  “Nosseyr then appointed his freedman Térik Ibn Zeydd Al-leythi to the govern-  “ment of his new conquests, as well as to the command of all the troops encamped  “in those districts.” So far Ibnu Khaldiin, whose account does not ant %  differ from that of the preceding writers.  We have said that one of the principal causes of the conquest of Andalus was the nya Tyén's discon-  appointment of Misa Ibn Nosseyr to the government of Africa; the second in order  is the enmity that broke out between Ilyén and Roderic. Every historian that we  have consulted alludes more or less explicitly to a certain quarrel between those two  individuals, which led to the invasion of the Arabs.” The author before quoted,  Abé Zeyd Ibn Khaldin, attributes it to a desire on the part of Ilydn of revenging  certain injuries he had received in the person of his daughter, who was then staying  in the royal palace ; since, adds that historian, it was a custom among the Gothic  nobles to send their daughters to be brought up and educated at the royal palace,  along with the king’s daughters. They say that when Ilyén heard of the outrage  committed on the person of his daughter he repaired immediately to court, took  her away, and brought her back to Africa. Not satisfied with this, he went to  see Tarik, acquainted him with his desire of revenge, engaged him to invade  Andalus, and offered to conduct his army through the enemy’s country. TArik,  who wished nothing so much as an occasion of trying the fortune of arms against  the neighbouring kingdom, immediately seized on Ilyan’s offer, and, having pre-  viously obtained his master’s leave, prepared for the intended expedition. But as  the doings between Ily4n and Roderic, and the application made by the former to  the Arabian general, are recounted more at length by other writers, we shall borrow  from them what we deem necessary to make this our history both agreeable and  instructive.  “It was then the custom among the Goths,” says Al-khozeyni, ‘“ for the nysu’s daugh-  “ princes of the royal blood, the great noblemen of the kingdom, and the governors Ree  “ of the provinces, to send to the supreme court at Toledo such among their sons *°*""*    a     256 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book Iv.    “as they chose to be promoted and advanced, and at the same time distinguished  “by the favour of their sovereign, under whose eye they were trained to all  “« military exercises, and were afterwards appointed to commands in the army. In  ‘* the same manner the daughters were sent to the king’s palace, and educated with  ‘“‘ his daughters, and when grown up the king would marry them to the young  “‘ noblemen at his court, according to their fathers’ dignity, and bestow upon them  “* marriage portions. ,   “It happened that in compliance with this custom Ilyan, the Lord of Ceuta,  “a city then under the sway of King Roderic, and the inhabitants of which also  ‘« professed the Christian religion, having a daughter, a beautiful and innocent  ‘* creature, crossed the straits and took her to Toledo, then the court and capital  “‘ of the kingdom. When Roderic beheld her, he was so much struck with her  “beauty that he fell desperately in love, and did not hesitate, when persuasion  “‘ had failed, to obtain by violence the gratification of his wishes. Some time  “ afterwards the girl found the means of secretly acquainting her father with the  “ treatment she had suffered at the hands of Roderic ; and it is related that when  “‘ Tlydn read his daughter’s message he fell into a most violent rage, and swore  “‘to revenge the injury inflicted by Roderic, exclaiming,—‘ By the faith of the  “* Messiah ! I will undermine his throne and disturb his dominions, until the whole  “is overturned and annihilated.’ So there can be no doubt that the injury done to  “« Tly4n’s daughter was one of the causes of the conquest of Andalus, subordinate  “to what God Almighty had decreed about it. Ily4n embarked immediately for  “ Andalus, although the inclement season was far advanced,—it being then the month  “ of January®? and the depth of winter,—and hastening to Toledo presented himself  “before the king, who, not expecting him at so unseasonable a time, upbraided  ‘him for leaving his post, and addressed him in the following words: ‘ What  “ brought thee here? Thou knowest very well that this is neither the time nor the  “ occasion for thy coming to court.’ To which Ilyén answered, excusing himself by  “ saying that his wife was dangerously ill, and desired greatly to see her daughter  ‘* once more before she died, and had begged and entreated him to fetch her. He  ‘then asked Roderic to issue orders that his daughter should be delivered to  “him, and all her baggage prepared for: immediate departure. Roderic granted  “his request, not without having previously made the daughter promise that she  “would keep their intercourse a secret from her father, but the girl preferred her  “ father to the king, and informed the former of his conduct towards her. They  “ say, on the authority of Ilyan himself, that when about to take leave of the king  “the latter addressed him as follows: ‘O Ily4n! I hope that I shall soon hear of  “thee, and that thou wilt endeavour to procure for me some of those very swift     CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 257    “* shadhankah® (hawks) which are such a source of pleasure and amusement to  “me, since they chase and hunt the birds and bring them to me;’ to which  “« Tly4n answered, ‘Doubt not, O King! but that I will soon be back, and, by the  “faith of the Messiah! I will never feel satisfied until I bring thee such sha-  “« dhankah as thou never sawest in thy life ;’ meaning by this the Arabs, whom he  ‘* already thought of bringing against his country. But Roderic did not understand  “ the meaning of his words.”   No sooner did Ilyén find himself safe in Africa than he repaired to the city of  Cairwan, where the Arabian governor then held his court, and by his glowing  descriptions of the fertility, wealth, and extent of the island of Andalus, by repre-  senting his countrymen as divided and weakened by internal divisions, and enervated  by their luxurious habits and a long peace, prevailed upon Miisa, as we shall  presently relate, to send with him some troops under the command of one of his  Berber freedmen, who, with the rapidity of the hawk pouncing upon his prey,  subdued the whole kingdom, and added new and extensive dominions to those  already subject to the sway of Islam.   Some historians assign a third cause for the conquest of Andalus ; they say that  there was at Toledo a palace built in times of old by a sage king, who, having  predicted that Andalus would in times to come be invaded by people from Africa,  had placed in one of its rooms a certain magic spell, by means of which the  country was to be for ever preserved from foreign invasion. As long as the  spell remained untouched Andalus was safe, but when broken (and it was so  by Roderic) the ruin of that country became inevitable. This event is thus related  by various historians.   It is well known that the Greeks ™ were a nation famous for their knowledge in eae eo  the sciences, as well as for their talent and acuteness in availing themselves of the ara  secrets of nature. Before the times of Alexander they inhabited the East, but their country.  when the Persians predominated in those quarters, and subdued every one of the  realms possessed by the Greeks, they decided upon emigrating and taking to a  distant land their knowledge and their science. They fixed upon the island of  Andalus, owing to its being placed at the extremity of the inhabited world, on  which account it was scarcely known at the time, had never been possessed by  any of the sage monarchs of olden times, and, finally, was then without inhabitants ;  for although Andalus, son of Yafeth, son of Nuh, had settled in it soon after the  deluge, taken it for his residence, given it his name, and left besides various traces  of his domination, yet his generation had since perished, and the country was then  a desert.* ‘   It has been said that when the earth was first peopled after the deluge it appeared   VOL. 1. 2.     258 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Boox Iv.    in the shape of a bird,—the east being the head,—the north and south, the richt and  left feet,—the countries between, the stomach,—and the west, the tail,~—and that  when the Greeks fixed upon Andalus as the country in which they were to settle in  preference to all others, it was owing to its relation to that despicable part of the  body (the tail), according to the picture we have drawn of the earth at the time; for  the Greeks of ancient days were more inclined to study than to war, making the  former supply on every occasion the place of the latter: they were therefore a  cowardly set, meeting their enemies with artifice rather than force, and, instead  of being ashamed of this, they boasted of it on every opportunity, knowing very well  that the cause of the decay and ruin of mighty empires was only to be looked  for in war. In order, therefore, not to be hindered and disturbed in the study  and cultivation of science, which made the principal business of their lives, they  fled before the Persians, their enemies, and migrated to Andalus, where they had  no sooner arrived than they began to dig canals, and to make cuts from the rivers  for the purpose of irrigation ; to erect bridges and aqueducts, to construct fortresses  and castles, to plant gardens and vines, and to build cities and towns; ploughing  and sowing the land, and raising whatever buildings were deemed necessary for  the pleasure and comfort of the people. In fine, the country soon became so thickly  peopled, and so studded with cities and towns, that one of their wise men, who  knew well that the country they inhabited had been called “‘ the bird’s tail,” owing  to the supposed resemblance of the earth to a bird with extended wings, is said  to have remarked that that bird was the peacock, the principal beauty of which  is well known to be in the tail. This brings to our recollection a witty answer once  made by a Western Arab to the Prince of believers, Hartin Ar-rashid (the mercy of  God be upon him!) That Khalif happened on a certain day to address a native  of Africa in the following manner: ‘ I am told, O man! that the world resembles  “a bird in shape ; and that the west is the tail.” ‘‘ Thou hast been told right, O  “ Prince of the believers!” replied the Maghrebi, “ but thy informer ought to have  “added that that bird was the peacock ;” hearing which, Ar-rashid laughed and  wondered much at the man’s quickness at repartee in defending his native country.  But to proceed with our account of the spell.”   The Greeks continued in possession of Andalus, leading a life of security and  pleasure. They took for a capital the city of Toledo, owing to its being situate  in the heart of Andalus, and their principal care consisted in strengthening it  against their enemies and maintaining themselves in their possessions, and con-  cealing from other nations the knowledge of the comforts they were enjoying. In  order better to gain their object they began consulting the stars, and found that  by two nations only were they to be disturbed in their enjoyments, and to be hated     CHAP. I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 259    on account of them, and these were represented to them. as. people unaccustomed to  the luxuries of life, hardened by privation and fatigue, in short—the Arabs and  Berbers. When the Greeks heard of this prognostic they were struck with fear,  and trembled for their populated island ; they agreed upon constructing immediately  a talisman that should avert their impending ruin, and by its power keep off the  two nations mentioned in the prophecy, to which effect they began consulting  the stars for a time and place fit for their undertaking. In the meanwhile, when-  ever some of the scattered tribes of Berbers inhabiting along the northern coast of  Africa happened to approach the sea shore, being thus separated only from Andalus  by a narrow channel, the fears and consternation of the Greeks would increase,  they would fly in all directions for fear of the threatened invasion, and their dread  of the Berbers waxed so great that it was instilled into their nature, and became in  after times a prominent feature in their character. On the other side, the Berbers  having been made acquainted with this ill-will and hatred of the people of An-  dalus towards them, hated and envied them the more, this being in a certain  measure the reason why even a long time afterwards a Berber could scarcely be  found who did not most cordially hate an Andalusian, and vice versa, only that  Berbers being more in want of Andalusians than these are of them, owing to  certain necessaries not to be procured in Africa, and which are imported from  Andalus, a communication has necessarily existed between the people of both  countries. But to return. .   There was in the west of Andalus a Grecian king, who reigned over an island  called the island of Kadis (Cadiz). This king had a daughter of incomparable  beauty, whom the other kings of Andalus,—for that country was then ruled by several  kings, each having estates not extending over more than one or two cities,—sought  in marriage. Each of these kings sent accordingly his messengers to Cadiz, and asked  for the hand of the beautiful daughter. Her father, however, unwilling to choose  among so many pretenders, lest by favouring one he should offend the others, was  very much perplexed, and sent for his daughter to acquaint her with the state of his  mind. Now it happened that the daughter of this king was possessed of much  wisdom as well as beauty, for among the Greeks both men and women were born  with a natural instinct for science; this having led to that common saying, that  ‘* science came down from heaven and lodged itself in three different parts of man’s  “ body; in the brains amongst the Greeks, in the hands amongst the Chinese,  “and in the tongue among the Arabs.” This daughter, then, having heard the  whole of the case, said to her father, ‘‘ Only do what I will tell thee, and do not  “ trouble thyself any more about this matter.”—‘ What is thy advice then? ’—  “‘ That to those who solicit my hand thou shouldst answer, that I will give the     260 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK Iv.    ‘* preference to him only who proves himself a sage king;” and her father ac-  cordingly dispatched messengers to the neighbouring kingdoms to acquaint the  royal suitors with his daughter’s determination. When the lovers read the letters  containing the princess’s intentions, many who could not lay any claim to science  immediately desistéd from their courtship ; two kings only being found among her  numerous admirers who professed themselves sages, and who immediately answered  his letters, each saying of himself, ‘‘ I am a sage king.” ‘When the father got  these letters, he sent for his daughter, and, informing her of their contents, ‘‘ See,”  said he, ‘“ we are still in the same difficulty as before; for here are two kings who  ‘* both call themselves sages, and if I choose one I shall make an enemy of the  “other. What dost thou propose to do in such a difficulty?” The daughter  replied, ‘‘ I will impose a task upon both kings, and whichsoever of the two executes  ‘it best, he shall be my husband.”—“ And pray, what is it? ’—‘‘ We want in  “ this town a wheel to draw up water ; I will ask one of them to make me one that  ‘‘ shall be moved by fresh running water coming from yonder land; and I will  ‘‘intrust the other with the construction of a talisman or charm to preserve this  ‘island from the invasions of the Berbers.”   The king was delighted with the plan suggested by his daughter, and, without  bestowing any more consideration on the subject, wrote to both the princes, making  them acquainted with his daughter’s ultimate determination; and each having  agreed to undergo the intended trial, they set to work as soon as possible. The  king to whose lot it had fallen to construct the hydraulic machine * erected an  immense building, with large stones placed one upon the top of another, in that part  of the salt sea which separates the island of Andalus from the continent; and in the  spot known by the name of Strait of Ceuta.*® This arched building, which was  built entirely of free-stone, the interstices of which were filled by the architect with  some cement of his own composition, connected the island of Cadiz with the main  land. Traces of this work are still visible in that part of the sea which divides  Ceuta from Algesiras,“° but the greatest part of the inhabitants of Andalus assign it  another origin, as I have already explained elsewhere ; they suppose it to be the  remains of a bridge which Alexander ordered to be constructed between Ceuta. and  Algesiras : but God only knows which of the two reports is the true one, although  I find the last of the two more generally believed. However, when the architect _  had finished his work of stone, he conducted fresh water from the top of a high  mountain on the continent to the island, and making it afterwards all fall into a  basin, he caused it to rise again in Andalus by means of a wheel.*!   As to the other king, whose task was the construction of the magic spell, he first  consulted the skies in quest of a proper and fit time to commence its fabrication ;     CHAP.

The materials  were of white stone, and the place chosen for its erection a sandy desert on the sea  shore. In order to give sufficient solidity to the building, the architect sunk the  foundations as deep into the earth as the building itself rose above the surface ;  and when he had completed it, he placed on the top a statue of melted copper and  iron, mixed together by dint of his science, to which he further gave the look and  appearance of a Berber, with a long beard ; his hair, which was exceedingly coarse,  stood upright on his head, and he had besides a tuft hanging over his forehead.“? His  garment consisted of a tunic, the ends of which he held on the left arm; he wore san-  ‘ dals on his feet, and the most extraordinary thing about him was that, although the  dimensions of the figure were excessive, and he stood up in the air at a distance  of more than sixty or seventy cubits, no other support was seen but the natural one  at his feet, which were at most one cubit in circumference. He had his right  arm extended, and in his hand were visible some keys with a padlock ;* with his  right hand he pointed towards the sea, as if he were saying, “ No one is to pass  “ this way ;” and such was the magic virtue contained in this figure, that as long  as it kept its place, and held the keys in its hand, no ship from Barbary could ever  sail into the strait, on account of its stormy and fearful waters.“   However, each of the kings worked with uncommon activity at his task,  hoping that whichsoever of the two accomplished his first stood a good chance of  gaining the heart of the princess. The constructor of the aqueduct was the  first to finish his, for he contrived so as to keep it secret from the other, in hopes  that if he did his work first, the talisman would not be completed, and the  victory would remain to him: and so it happened, for he measured his time so well,  that on the very same day on which his rival’s work was to be accomplished water  began to run in the island, and the wheel to move; and when the news of his   - success reached his competitor, who was then on the top of the monument giving  the last polish to the face of the figure, which was gilt, he took it so much to heart  that he threw himself down, and fell dead at the foot of the tower; by which means  the other prince, freed from his rival, became the master of the lady, of the wheel,  and of the charm.   The author from whom the preceding narrative is borrowed does not acquaint  us in what manner the spell acted against Africans, nor how its virtue came to be  impaired, but we here subjoin another writer’s version of this story.   In times of old the Greek kings who reigned in Andalus were terribly afraid of  an invasion on the part of the Berbers, on account of the prophecy that we have  recorded. To avoid this they constructed different spells, and, among others, one  which they put inside a marble urn and placed in a palace at Toledo: in order     262 . HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Boox Iv.    to ensure its custody and preservation they placed a padlock on the gate of the  palace, leaving instructions for every succeeding king to do the same. This injunc-  tion having been faithfully complied with, it came to pass that after the lapse ofa  great many years twenty-seven padlocks were appended to the gate of the building,  that number of kings having reigned in Andalus, each of whom had put his  padlock as ordained. Some time previous to the invasion of the Arabs, which, as is  well known, was the cause of the overthrow of the Gothic dynasty and of the entire  conquest of Andalus, a king of the Goths, Roderic by name,** ascended the throne.  Now this king, being young and fond of adventure, once assembled his Wizirs,  great officers of the state, and members of his council, and spoke to them thus :—  “T have been thinking a long time about this house with its seven-and-twenty  “ padlocks, and I am determined to have it opened, that I may see what it contains,  ‘« for I am sure it is a mere jest.” ‘‘ It may be so, O King!” answered one of the  Wizirs ; ‘‘ but honesty, prudence, and policy demand that thou shouldst not do it;  “ and that, following the example of thy father, of thy grandfather, and of thy  “ ancestors,—none of whom ever wished to dive into this mystery,—thou shouldst  “add a new padlock to the gate.” When the Wizir had done speaking, Roderic  replied,—‘* No: I am led by an irresistible impulse, and nothing shall make me  “ change my resolution. I have an ardent wish to penetrate this mystery, and my  “ curiosity must be satisfied.” ‘‘ O King! answered the Wizirs, “if thou doest it  “under a belief that treasures are concealed in it, let us hear thy estimation of  ‘them, and we will collect the sum among ourselves and deposit it in thy royal  “ treasure, rather than see ourselves and thee exposed to frightful calamities and  “‘ misery.” But Roderic being a man of undaunted spirit, stout of heart, and  strong of determination, was not easily persuaded. He remained deaf to the  entreaties of his counsellors and proceeded immediately towards the palace, and  when he arrived at the gate, which, as we have already observed, was furnished  with several locks, each of them having its key hanging to it, the gate was  thrown open, and nothing else was to be seen but a large table made of gold  and silver and set with precious stones, upon which was to be read the following  inscription :—‘‘ This is the table of Suleyman, son of Datid, (upon whom be  “* peace!)” Another object, besides the table, was to be seen in another apartment  of the palace, provided. also with a very strong padlock, which being removed  * allowed Roderic to look into it. But what was his astonishment on entering the  apartment when nothing was to be seen but the urn, and inside it a roll of  parchment and a picture representing in the brightest colours several horsemen  looking like Arabs, dressed in skins of animals, and having, instead of turbans,  locks of coarse hair; they were mounted 'on fleet Arabian steeds, bright scimitars     cua. 1.) DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 263    hung by their sides, and their right hands were armed with spears. Roderic ordered  his attendants to unroll the parchment, when lo! what did he see but the following  inscription written in large letters upon it :—‘‘ Whenever this asylum is violated, and  “ the spell contained in this urn broken, the people painted on this urn shall invade  “ Andalus, overturn the throne of its kings, and subdue the whole country.”*  They say that when Roderic read this fatal prognostic he repented of what he had  done, and was impressed with a strong belief of his impending ruin. He was not  mistaken, for tidings soon reached him of an army of Arabs, which the emperor of  the East sent against him.   This is the enchanted palace and the picture to which Roderic is said to have  alluded afterwards, on the day of the battle of Guadalete, when, as he was advancing  upon the Moslems, he saw for the first time. before his eyes the very men whose  representations were upon the parchment. Of this more will be said hereafter.  But whether this account is a true one or not, God only knows, for we find it  related in various ways by the historians, as we shall have further occasion to  observe when we come to, treat about the famous table of Suleyman and other  particulars connected with this case, and that we shall do by taking our information  from the best and purest sources. As to the other story, namely, that of the sage  king making a contrivance to bring sweet water from Africa into Andalus, it is  scarcely credible, for Andalus happens just to be one of the countries most  abounding in waters and rivers ; and therefore we do not see the necessity of  bringing water from the opposite shore, unless, as some pretend, the princess only  did it to puzzle her admirer and try his skill by imposing upon him this extra-  ordinary and most difficult task. But I again repeat, God only knows; for he is  the creator and ‘master of all science!",book_4,chapter_1

No sooner did Ily4n, the Lord of Ceuta, arrive safely in his dominions, than he  went to see the Amir Misa Ibn Nosseyr, and proposed to him the conquest of  Andalus, which he described as a country of great excellence and blessings ; he  told him that it was a land abounding in productions of all kinds, rich in grain  of all sorts, plentiful in waters renowned for their sweetness and clearness; he  proceeded afterwards to draw the picture of the inhabitants, whom he affirmed  to be enervated by long peace, and destitute of arms.! This account awakened  the ambition of the Amir, who, after a mature deliberation on the proposition  made to him, came to the following agreement with Ily4n,—that he should desert  the cause which he was then defending? and pass over to the Moslems, and that  by way of proving his enmity towards his own countrymen, professing the same  religion as himself, he should first of all make an incursion into their country. This  Tly4n immediately put into execution, and, collecting some troops in the districts  subject to his rule, he embarked in two vessels and landed on the coast of  Algesiras,> whence he overran the country, and after killing and making a number  of captives he and his companions returned safe to Africa, loaded with spoil, on the  following day.   No sooner did the news of this first expedition, which took place at the close  of the year ninety,* become known in Africa, than a great many Moslems flocked  under the banners of Ily4n and trusted him. As for the Amir Misa, he wrote    Misa aequaints immediately to the Khalif Al-walid, informing him of what Iy4n proposed to    Al-walfd with  the victory.    him to undertake against Andalus, and asking his leave to try the conquest,*  and the answer of the Khalif was conceived in the following terms :—‘“ Let     CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 265    “the country be first explored by light troops, to overrun it and bring thee  “news of what it contains; be prudent, and do not allow the Moslems to be  ‘lost in an ocean of dangers and horrors.” To which Misa replied, “ It is  “ not an ocean, but only a narrow channel, whose shores are every where distinct  “to the eye.” ‘‘ Never mind,” answered Al-walid; ‘‘ even if it be so, let the  “« country be first explored.” ®   Accordingly Misa sent a freedman of his, a Berber, whose name was Tarif Abi ape  Zar’ah,’ with four hundred foot and one hundred horsemen,® with instructions to  make an incursion into Andalus. Tarif and his small army embarked in four vessels,  and landed on an island situated opposite to another island? close to Andalus, and  known by the name of Jeztrah Al-khadhrd (the green island), where the Arabs  of the present days keep their ships and their naval stores,'° it being their principal  port to cross over to Africa. In this island, which has since taken the name of Tarif,  on account of his landing on it,'' the Berber general stayed a whole day, until all  his men were with him ;!? he then moved on and made several inroads into the  main land, which produced a rich spoil and several captives, who were so hand-  some that Misa and his companions had never seen the like of them.’* This  took place in the month of Ramadhan of the year ninety-one (Aug.-Sept. a.p.  710),'* and when it was made known every one wished to go to Andalus.   The number of troops that accompanied Tarif in this expedition is not satis- Lanting of  factorily ascertained. Some authors make it amount to one thousand men ; others  give him only half that number, as above stated. But we must observe that the  whole of these accounts are very doubtful, since there are not wanting historians  who make Tarif a different person from Abi Zar’ah, as these words of one of them  seem to purport. ‘‘ Tarif returned from this expedition loaded with spoil, and  “ bringing a great number of captives ; another incursion was made by a Sheikh  “of the Berbers, whose name was Abi Zar’ah,'® who landed with one thousand  “men of his nation on the island of Algesiras, and finding that the inhabitants  “had deserted the island he set fire to their houses and fields, and burnt also  “a church '® very much venerated amongst them. He then put to the sword such  “of its inhabitants as he met, and, making a few prisoners, returned safe to  “* Africa.”   But we believe the former account to be the most credible, since it is confirmed  by Ar-rdzi!7 and other historians, who make these two captains to be one and the  same person, and call him Abi Zar’ah Tarif Ibn Malik Al-mughéferi,'® for such  were his name and patronymic.   But to proceed. Jly4n went a second time to Mtisa Ibn Nosseyr, and ap-  prised him of the happy result of the inroad he had made in Andalus, as well as   VOL. 1. 2M     Misa sends  Tarik.    He lands at  Gibraltar.    266 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book tv.    that of Tarif Abi Zar’ah,’® and how they had both been crowned with success. He  at the same time instigated him to undertake the conquest of the country more at  large: he told him what captives they had brought him, and the good tidings about  the fertility and wealth of the land. When Misa heard of it he praised God for the  victory he had granted his servants, and strengthened himself in his intention of  invading Andalus ; to this effect he called a freed slave of his, to whom he had on  different occasions intrusted important commands in his armies, and whose name  was Tarik Ibn Zeydd Ibn ’Abdillah, a native of Hamdan, in Persia, although some  pretend that he was not a freedman of Misa Ibn Nosseyr, but a free-born man of the  tribe of Sadf,?° while others make him a mauli?! of Lahm. It is even asserted that  some of his posterity who lived in Andalus rejected with indignation the supposition  of their ancestor having ever been a liberated slave of Misa Ibn Nosseyr. Some  authors, and they are the greatest number, say that he was a Berber, but, as we  intend to form a separate article about Tarik, we shall leave the discussion of this  and other points for another place, confining ourselves at present to the relation  of the historical events as we find them recorded by the best Andalusian writers.   To this Tarik, therefore, whether a liberated slave of Misa, or a freeman of the  tribe of Sadf, the Arabian governor of Africa committed the important trust of con-  quering the kingdom of Andalus, for which end he gave him the command of an  army of seven thousand men, chiefly Berbers and slaves, very few only being genuine  Arabs. To accompany and guide Térik in this expedition Miisa again sent Iyan,  who provided four vessels from the ports under his command, the only places on  the coast where vessels were at that time built. Every thing being got ready, a  division of the army crossed that arm of the sea which divides Andalus from Africa,  and landed with T4rik at the foot of the mountain which afterwards received his  name, on a Saturday, in the month of Sha’bdn of the year ninety-two (July, 711),  answering to the month of Agosht (August), and the four vessels were sent back,  and crossed and recrossed until the rest of Térik’s men were safely put on shore.   It is otherwise said that T4rik landed on the twenty-fourth of Rejeb (19th June,  711), in the same year. Another account makes the number of men embarked on  this occasion amount to twelve thaqusand, all but sixteen, a number consisting almost  entirely of Berbers, there being but few Arabs amongst them ; but the same writer  agrees that Ilydn transported this force at various times™ to the coast of Andalus  in merchant vessels, (whence collected it is not known,) and that Térik was the  last man on board.*   Various historians have recorded two circumstances concerning Tarik’s passage  and his landing on the coast of Andalus, which we consider worthy of being tran-  scribed. They say that while he was sailing across that arm of the sea which     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 267    separates Africa from Andalus he saw in a dream™ the prophet Mohammed,  surrounded by Arabs of the Muhajirin®® and Anssdr, who with unsheathed swords  and bended bows stood close by him, and that he heard the Prophet say, “ Take  “ courage, O Térik! and accomplish what thou art destined to perform;” and that  having looked round him he saw the messenger of God, (upon whom be the peace  and salutation of his Lord!) who with his companions was entering Andalus.  Tarik then awoke from his sleep, and, delighted with this good omen, hastened  to communicate the miraculous circumstance to his followers, who were much  pleased and strengthened. T4rik himself was so much struck by the apparition  that from that moment he never doubted of victory.   The same writers have preserved another anecdote, which sufficiently proves  the mediation of the Almighty in permitting that the conquest of Andalus should  be achieved by Térik. Directly after his landing on the rock Miisa’s freedman  brought his forces upon the plain, and began to overrun and lay waste the neigh-  bouring country. While he was thus employed, an old woman from Algesiras””  presented herself to him, and among other things told him what follows: “ Thou  “ must know, O stranger! that I had once a husband who had the knowledge of  “ future events ; and I have repeatedly heard him say to the people of this country  “ that a foreign general would come to this island and subject it to his arms. He  “ described him to me as a man of prominent forehead, and such, I see, is thine ; he  “told me also that the individual designated by the prophecy would have a black  “ mole covered with hair on his left shoulder. Now, if thou hast such a mark on  “thy body, thou art undoubtedly the person intended.”” When Tarik heard the  old woman’s reasoning, he immediately laid his shoulder bare, and the mark being  found, as predicted, upon the left one, both he and his companions were filled  with delight at the good omen.”   Tbnu Hayydn’s account does not materially differ from those of the historians  from whom we have quoted. He agrees in saying that Ily4n, Lord of Ceuta, incited  Misa Ibn Nosseyr to make the conquest of Andalus; and that this he did out of  revenge, and moved by the personal enmity and hatred he had conceived against  Roderic. He makes Térik’s army amount only to seven thousand,” mostly  Berbers,-which, he says, crossed in four vessels provided by Iy4n. According to  his account Térik landed on a Saturday, in the month of Sha’ban of the year ninety-  two,” and the vessels that brought him and his men on shore were immediately  sent back to Africa, and never ceased going backwards and forwards until the whole  of the army was safely landed on the shores of Andalus.   On the other side, Ibnu Khaldtin®' reckons the army under the orders of Tarik     268 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book Iv.    at three hundred Arabs, and ten thousand Berbers. He says that before starting on  his expedition Tarik divided his army into two corps, he himself taking the com-  mand of one, and placing the other under the immediate orders of Tarif An-naja’i.*?  Tarik, with his men, landed at the foot of the rock now called Jebalu-l-fatah (the  mountain of the entrance), and which then received his name, and was called  Jebal-Térik (the mountain of Tarik); while his companion Tarif landed on the  island afterwards called after him Jeztrah-Tar(f (the island of Tarif). In order to  provide for the security of their respective armies, both generals selected, soon after  their landing, a good encampment, which they surrounded with walls and trenches,  for no sooner had the news of their landing spread than the armies of the Goths  began to march against them from all quarters.   The precise date of Tarik’s invasion has been differently stated. Some historians,  as Ibnu Khaldtn, content themselves with giving the year, viz., ninety-two (be-  ginning 28th October, 710); others have fixed the month and the day in which this  memorable event is supposed to have taken place. Ibnu-l-khattib places it on Monday,  five days before the end of Rejeb (25th Rejeb) of the year ninety-two (20th June, 711);  Ibnu Hayydn on a Saturday of the month of Sha’b4n: others say on the twenty-  fourth of Rejeb; Adh-dhobi on the eighth day of the same month. There are not  wanting authors who place it at the beginning of the year ninety-three ; but those who  fix it in ninety-two are most in number. God only knows the truth of the case.   pieced by But, to continue our narrative, no sooner did T4rik set his foot in Andalus than  he was attacked by a Goth named Tudmir (Theodomir), to whom Roderic had  intrusted the defence of that frontier. Theodomir, who is the same general who  afterwards gave his name to a province of Andalus, called Beldd Tudmtr® (the  country of Theodomir), having tried, although in vain,** to stop the impetuous  career of Térik’s men, dispatched immediately a messenger to his master, apprising  him how Tarik and his followers had landed in Andalus. He also wrote him a  letter, thus conceived :—‘‘ This our land has been invaded by people whose name,  ‘* country, and origin are unknown to me. I cannot even tell thee whence they  ‘* came,—whether they fell from the skies, or sprang from the earth.”   Roce aster ‘When this news reached Roderic, who was then in the country of the Bashkans   of his kingdom. (Basques), making war in the territory of Banbilénah (Pamplona),*” where serious  disturbances had occurred, he guessed directly that the blow came from LIlydn.  Sensible; however, of the importance of this attack made upon his dominions, he  left what he had in hand, and, moving towards the south with the whole of his   Arrives in Cor- powerful army, arrived in Cordova, which is placed in the centre of Andalus. There   jove he took up his abode in the royal castle, which the Arabs called after him Roderic’s     CHAP. II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 269    castle, and which we have already described in another part of this book.** In this  palace Roderic took up his residence for a few days, to await the arrival of the nume-  rous troops which he had summoned from the different provinces of his kingdom.   They say that while he was staying in Cordova he wrote to the sons of Wittiza  to come and join him against the common enemy ; for although it is true, as we  have already related, that Roderic had usurped the throne of their father and perse-  cuted the sons, yet he had spared their lives ;—since these two sons of Wittiza are  the same who, when Térik attacked the forces of King Roderic on the plains of  Guadalete, near the sea, turned back and deserted their ranks, owing to a promise  made them by Térik to restore them to the throne of their father if they helped  him against Roderic. However, when Roderic arrived in Cordova, the sons of  Wittiza were busily engaged in some distant province collecting troops to march  against the invaders, and he wrote to them to come and join him with their forces, ee  in order to march together against the Arabs; and, cautioning them against the  inconvenience and danger of private feuds at that moment, engaged them to join  him and attack the Arabs in one mass. The sons of Wittiza readily agreed to  Roderic’s proposition, and collecting all their forces came to meet him, and  encamped not far from the village of Shakandah, on the opposite side of the river,°*  and on the south of the palace of Cordova. There they remained for some time,  not daring to enter the capital or to trust Roderic, until at last, having ascertained  the truth of the preparations, and seeing the army march out of the city and him  with it, they entered Cordova, united their forces to his,*? and marched with him  against the enemy, although, as will be seen presently, they were already planning  the treachery which they afterwards committed. Others say that the sons of  Wittiza did not obey the summons sent them by the usurper Roderic ; on the con-  trary, that they joined Térik with all their forces: but which of these reports is the  true one God only knows. However, it seems to have been ascertained that all the  princes of the Goths came to join Roderic in this expedition, although it is equally  true that he was deserted by some of his noblemen on the field of battle. But  much obscurity prevails in the writings of the historians who have recorded the  events of those early times. Even the name of the Gothic monarch at the time of  Tarik’s invasion has been spelt in different ways, for we find it written thus,—  Rudheric, and Ludheric ; although the latter is more commonly used. It is also  stated that he was a descendant from Isbahdn (Hispan);*' but this is contrary to the  accounts of Ibnu Hayydn and others, who say that he was not of royal blood.   When Térik received the news of the approach of Roderic’s army, which is said pipe  to have amounted to nearly one hundred thousand men, provided with all kinds of forcements.  weapons and military stores, he wrote to Miisa for assistance, saying that he had     Discontent of  the nobles.    Treason of the  sons of Wittiza.    270 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book iv.    taken Algesiras, a port of Andalus, thus becoming by its possession the master of  the passage into that country; that he had subdued its districts as far as the bay;  but that Roderic was now advancing against him with a force which it was not in  his power to resist, except it was God Almighty’s will that it should be so. Musa,  who since TA4rik’s departure for this expedition had been employed in building ships,  and had by this time collected a great many, sent by them a reinforcement of five  thousand Moslems, which, added to the seven thousand of the first expedition, made  the whole forces amount to twelve thousand *? men, eager for plunder and anxious  for battle. Tlyén, Lord of Ceuta, who had become a tributary of the Moslems, was  also sent with his army and the people of his states to accompany this expedi-  tion, and to guide it through the passes in the country, and gather intelligence  for them.   In the meanwhile Roderic was drawing nearer to the Moslems, with all the forces  of the barbarians, their lords, their knights, and their bishops ;** but the hearts of  the great people of the kingdom being against him, they used to see each other  frequently, and in their private conversations they uttered their sentiments about  Roderic in the following manner: ‘‘ This wretch has by force taken possession of  “ the throne to which he is not justly entitled, for not only he does not belong to  ‘‘ the royal family, but he was once one of our meanest menials ; ** we do not  “ know how far he may carry his wicked intentions against us. There is no doubt  ‘* but that Térik’s followers do not intend to settle in this country ; their only wish  ‘is to fill their hands with spoil and then return. Let us then, as soon as the  “battle is engaged, give way, and leave the usurper alone to fight the strangers,  ‘* who will soon deliver us from him; and, when they shall be gone, we can place  “ on the throne him who most deserves it.” *® In these sentiments all agreed, and  it was decided that the proposed plan should be put into execution ; the two sons of  Wittiza, whom Roderic had appointed to the command of the right and left wings  of his army, being at the head of the conspiracy, in.the hope of gaining the throne  of their father.   When the armies drew nearer to each other, the princes began to spin the web of  their treason ; and for this purpose a messenger was sent by them to Tarik, in-  forming him how Roderic, who had been a mere menial and servant to their  father,“’ had, after his death, usurped the throne ; that the princes had by no means  relinquished their rights, and that they implored protection and security for them-  selves. They offered to desert, and pass over to Térik with the troops under their  command, on condition that the Arab general would, after subduing the whole of  Andalus, secure to them all their father’s possessions, amounting to three thousand  valuable and chosen farms, the same that received after this the name of Safdyd-l-     CHAP. 11.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 271    molik (the royal portion). This offer Térik accepted ; and, having agreed to the  conditions, on the next day the sons of Wittiza deserted the ranks of the Gothic  army in the midst of battle, and passed ‘over to Térik, this being no doubt one of  the principal causes of the conquest.   Roderic arrived on the banks of the Guadalete (Wddt-Lek) *° with a formidable roi Ca  army, which most historians compute at one hundred thousand cavalry ; © although eae ete  Ibnu Khaldiéin makes it amount to forty thousand men only. Roderic brought all  his treasures and military stores in carts: he himself came in a litter, placed between  two mules, having over his head an awning® richly set with pearls, rubies, and  emeralds. On the approach of this formidable tempest the Moslems did not lose  courage, but prepared to meet their adversary. Tarik assembled his men, com-  forted them by his words, and after rendering the due praises to the Almighty God,  and returning thanks for what had already been accomplished, proceeded to implore  his mighty help for the future. He then encouraged the Moslems, and kindled  their enthusiasm with the following address.—‘{Whither can you fly,—the enemy IY Técik’s atdren  ‘is in your front, the sea at your back?

II.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 273    shock similar to that of two mountains dashing against each other. King Roderic  came borne on a throne,-and having over his head an awning®’ of variegated silk  to guard him from the rays of the sun, surrounded by warriors cased in bright  steel, with fluttering pennons, and a profusion of banners and standards. TaArik’s  men were differently. arrayed ; their breasts were covered with mail armour, they  wore white turbans on their heads, the Arabian bow** slung across their backs,  their swords suspended to their girdles, and their long spears firmly grasped in  their hands. They say that when the two armies were advancing upon each  other, and the eyes of Roderic fell upon the men in the first ranks, he was horror-  struck, and was heard to exclaim,—“ By the faith of the Messiah! These are the  “ very men I saw painted on the scroll found in the mansion of science at Toledo,”  and from that moment fear entered his heart ; and when-Térik perceived Roderic  he said to his followers, ‘‘ This is the King of the Christians,” °® and he charged  with his men, the warriors who surrounded Roderic being on all sides scattered  and dispersed ; seeing which, Tarik plunged into the ranks of the enemy until he  reached the king, and wounded him with his sword on the head and killed him  on his throne ;* and when Roderic’s men saw their king fall and his body guard  dispersed, the rout became general and victory remained to the Moslems. The  rout of the Christians was complete, for instead of rallying on one spot they fled  in all directions, and, their panic being communicated to their countrymen, cities  opened their gates, and castles surrendered without resistance, &c. The preceding  account we have borrowed from a writer of great note, but we deem it necessary  to warn the readers that the assertion that Roderic died by the hands of Térik ~  has been contradicted by several historians, since his body, although diligently  sought on the field of battle, could nowhere be found; but of this more will be  said in the course of our narrative. We shall proceed to recount in detail that  memorable battle, when Almighty God was pleased to put King Roderic’s army to  flight, and grant the Moslems a most complete victory. ;  Several authors who have described at large this famous engagement state that  Tarik encamped near Roderic, towards the middle of the month of Ramadhén of the  year ninety-two (Sept. a.p. 711), and although there is some difference as to the  dates, all agree that the battle was fought on the banks of the Wadaleke (Guadalete),  in the distriet of Shidhiinah.* They say also that while both armies were encamped  in front of each other, the barbarian king, wishing to ascertain the exact amount  of T4rik’s forces, sent one of his men,“ whose valour and strength he knew,  and in whose fidelity he placed unbounded confidence, with instructions to pene-  trate into Térik’s camp and bring him an account of their number, arms, accoutre-  ments, and vessels. The Christian proceeded to execute his commission, and  VOL. I. 2N     Roderic’s fate.    274 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN. [Book Iv.    reached a small elevation whence he had a commanding view of the whole camp.  However, he had not remained long in his place of observation before he was  discovered by some Moslems, who pursued him, but the Christian fled before  them and escaped through the swiftness of his horse. Arrived at the Christian  camp he addressed Roderic in the following words. ‘‘ These people, O King!  “* are the same thou sawest painted on the scroll of the enchanted palace. Beware  ‘‘of them! for the greatest part of them have bound themselves by oath to reach  “thee or die in the attempt; they have set fire to their vessels,® to destroy  “ their last hope of escape ; they are encamped along the sea shore,* determined  “to die or to vanquish, for they know well that there is not in this country a  ‘* place whither they can fly.” On hearing this account King Roderic was much  disheartened, and he trembled with fear. However, the two armies engaged  near the lake or gulf; they fought resolutely on both sides till the right and  left wings of Roderic’s army, under the command of the sons of Wittiza, gave  way. The centre, in which Roderic was, still held firm for awhile, and made  the fate of the battle uncertain for some time; they fled at last, and Roderic  before them. From that moment the rout became general, and the Moslems  followed with ardour the pursuit of the scattered bands, inflicting death wherever  they went. Roderic disappeared in the midst of the battle, and no certain intel-  ligence was afterwards received of him; it is true that some Moslems found his  favourite steed,® a milk-white horse, bearing a saddle of gold sparkling with rubies,  plunged in the mud of the river, as also one of his sandals, adorned with rubies  and emeralds, but the other was never found; nor was Roderic, although diligently  searched for, ever discovered either dead or alive, a circumstance which led the  Moslems to believe that he perished in the stream’; indeed there are not wanting  authors who give it as certain that he died in this manner, and that, while trying  to cross the stream, the weight of his armour” prevented him from struggling  against the current, and he was drowned; but God only knows what became of  him.”   According to Ar-razi, the contest began on a Sunday, two days before the end of  Ramadhan, and continued till Sunday, the fifth of Shawdl, namely, eight whole  days,” at the end of which God Almighty was pleased to put the idolaters to flight  and grant the victory to the Moslems ; and he adds, that so great was the number  of the Goths who perished in the battle, that for a long time after the victory  the bones of the slain were to be seen covering the field of action.   They say also that the spoil found by the Moslems in the camp of the Christians  surpassed all computation, for the princes and great men of the Goths who had  fallen were distinguished by the rings of gold they wore on their fingers, those of an     CHAP. I1.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 275    inferior class by similar ornaments of silver, while those of the slaves were made of  brass.” ‘Térik collected all the spoil and divided it into five shares or portions,  when, after deducting one-fifth, he distributed the rest amongst nine thousand  Moslems, besides the slaves and followers.   When the people on the other side of the straits heard of this success of Tarik, and Taking of $i.  of the plentiful spoils he had acquired, they flocked to him from all quarters, and Gomis  crossed the sea on every vessel or bark they could lay hold of. Térik’s army being  so considerably reinforced, the Christians were obliged to shut themselves up in  their castles and fortresses, and, quitting the flat country, betake themselves to their  mountains. Tarik first marched against Sidonia,”® which he besieged and took by  force after the garrison had defended it some time. In this city Tarik found con-  siderable spoil. From Sidonia he proceeded to Moror,’* whence he turned towards  Carmona,” and, passing by a fountain which afterwards received his name, he Carmona.  invested that city, which surrendered to him immediately, the inhabitants agreeing  to pay tribute. He next encamped before Ezija, and besieged it. The inhabitants kzije.  being numerous and brave, and having with them some remnants of Roderic’s army,  made at first a desperate defence ; but after a severe battle, in which a great many  Moslems were killed or wounded, it pleased Almighty God to grant them victory,  and the idolaters were put to rout and dispersed. No battle was afterwards fought  in which the Moslems had so much to suffer, for the Christians defended themselves  with the utmost vigour and resolution, and great was the havoc which they made  in the ranks of the faithful. However, the Almighty permitted that Tarik should  notice the governor, a crafty man, much experienced in battle, leave the town and  take, without attendants, the road to the river for the purpose of bathing. Tarik  did not know who he was, but, judging by his arms and his steed, he thought he  might be some person of distinction. No sooner was he aware of it, than, impelled  by his adventurous humour, he took the same direction, repaired to the river, feigned  a purpose similar to that of the barbarian, and, jumping into the water, made him  his prisoner ; he then conducted him to his camp, where the barbarian discovered  himself, and said he was the governor of the city, upon which the Arab general  granted him peace on the usual terms of paying tribute, and dismissed him free to  return to the city, where, as soon as he was returned, he fulfilled his word by  surrendering it to‘the Arabs.   In the meanwhile God filled with terror and alarm the hearts of the idolaters, and  their consternation was greatly increased when they saw Térik penetrate far into  their country ; for, as we have said elsewhere, they were under a belief that his  object in the attack was only to gain spoil and then return to his country. When,  therefore, they saw Térik advance to further conquests they were seized with despair, °    i     276 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1v,    and, abandoning the flat country, fled to the mountains, or betook themselves to  their strong castles; a few only of the principal people repaired to the capital,  Toledo, with the intention of holding out resistance within its walls. It is said  that Térik, too, endeavoured to increase the terror of the Christians by means  of the following stratagem :—he directed his men to cook the flesh of the slain in  presence of the Gothic captives in his camp, and when the flesh had thus been  cooked in large copper vessels he ordered it to be cut up, as if it were to be distri-  buted to his men for their meals ; he after this allowed some of the captives to  escape, that they might report to their countrymen what they had seen. And thus  the stratagem produced the desired effect, since the report of the fugitives contri-  buted in no small degree to increase the panic of the infidels.”",book_4,chapter_2

Tarik divides his army—Mugheyth besieges Cordova—Takes the governor prisoner—Malaga and  Granada taken by Térik’s lieutenants—Theodomir attacked—Besieged in Orihuela—Capitulates—  Siege and taking of Toledo by Térik—Spoils found by T4rik—Miusa prepares to cross over to Andalus  —Rebellion at Seville—Miisa goes to Toledo—The table of Suleymén described.    Arrer this they say that Ily4n addressed T4rik in the following words :—“ Since Térk i divides  “thy enemies are panic-struck, and their armies dispersed, proceed to their capital,  “and destroy them before they have time to collect their forces again. Take  “expert guides from among my people; divide thy army into bodies, and send  “them to different parts of the country, and, if thou follow my advice, thou wilt  “ thyself take a division of it and march towards Toledo, where their great men  “are by this time assembled to ce upon their affairs, and unite under a   “ chief of their choosing.” !   Térik assented immediately to the advice given by Iyén, but, before leaving Ezija, Msshey  he dispatched Mugheyth Ar-rimi (the Greek), a freedman of the Sult4n Al-walid, Comdov=  son of ’Abdu-l-malek, with seven hundred horse; for the Moslems by this time  were all, without exception, mounted on horses taken from the barbarians, and  had even some remaining. Mugheyth’s instructions were to attack Cordova, one  of their principal cities. Térik sent another division of his army against Malaga, ’  and a third against Gharnatt4,? the town of Al-birah (Elvira), while he himself, at  the head of the main body, hastened towards Toledo by way of Jaen: some authors  pretend that T4rik himself went to Cordova,> and not Mugheyth, but the former  account is the most certain.   However, those who follow the first opinion relate the affair in the following  manner. They say that Mugheyth’s army, having arrived close to Cordova, en-’  camped in a forest of lofty pines* on the bank® of the river of Shakandah. Having  soon after his arrival at the spot sent out his scouts® to gain if possible a knowledge  of the country, these soon returned with a shepherd, who, being interrogated about     278 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book tv.    Cordova, informed Mugheyth that the principal people of the city had quitted it and  gone to Toledo, but that a governor had been left behind with a garrison of four  hundred horsemen, besides the invalids and old soldiers.? The shepherd being  further questioned respecting the walls of the city said that they were strong and  high, but that there was a breach in them, which he described. Accordingly, no  sooner were the Moslems enveloped in the shadows of night than they set off  towards the city, and approached its walls, where God Almighty opened to them the  means of success, by sending a providential fall of hail, which prevented the stepping  of the horses from being heard. The Moslems proceeded gently and unnoticed till  they arrived on the banks of the river,® which they crossed, finding themselves then  at a distance of only thirty cubits, or perhaps less, from the walls. Owing to the  squalls of rain, and the cold of the night, the sentries, neglecting their duties, were  not on the walls keeping guard, a circumstance which allowed the Moslems to arrive  unheard and unmolested at the foot of the battlements; they then attempted to  scale the walls, but failed in their attempt by not finding a place to fix the  ladders. In this difficulty they returned to the shepherd, and asked him to lead  them to the breach he had mentioned ; this the man did, but it was also found upon  trial not to be of easy ascent. However, this was after some time obtained by  means of a fig tree, growing close to the walls, the branches of which afforded the  means of ascending. One of their strongest men mounted the tree, whence he  succeeded in gaining the top of the breach. Mugheyth then unfolded his turban,  and gave one end of it to the man, who by means of it succeeded in helping others  on until a considerable number of Moslems gained the summit of the wall.  Mugheyth, who remained on horseback at the foot of the battlements, then com-  manded the assailant party to rush upon the guard within the city. This order was  quickly obeyed by the Moslems, who surprised and killed many of the garrison,  and, breaking open the gate, let in Mugheyth and the rest of his men, who soon got  possession of the city. This being done, Mugheyth, with his guides, hastened  towards the palace of the governor, who, having received intelligence of the entry of  the Moslems, fled with his guards, four hundred in number, and betook himself to a  church situate at the west® of the city, and fortified himself in it. As water was  conveyed under ground to this church from a spring at the foot of a neighbouring  mountain, the besieged defended themselves some time against Mugheyth, who  nevertheless ruled in the city and its environs.   The same authors, namely, those who pretend that Té4rik was not present at the  taking of Cordova, and that this exploit was achieved singly by Mugheyth, state  that this latter general, after writing to Tarik to apprise him of his victory, con-  tinued to besiege the Christians shut up in the church. After three months of siege,     cHaP. 111.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 279    seeing that he could not reduce them, Mugheyth began to grow impatient and  melancholy, and thought of devising some stratagem that might make him master  of the fortress. He then called before him one of his black slaves, whose name  was Rabéh,’° a man of tried courage and fortitude, and directed him to hide  himself at night in a garden covered with trees"" that lay close to the church, to try  if he could not by chance lay hold of some barbarian, who might inform him of the  state of the garrison. The black man did as he was ordered, but being a stupid  fellow he soon committed himself; for as it was then the season for the trees to bear  fruit, and the place was covered with them, he mounted one in order to gather  some fruit, and eat of it. While he was thus perched in the tree he was discovered  by the people of the church, who, coming to the spot, made him get down, and  having secured him took him prisoner inside. Great was the fright, and at the  same time the astonishment, which the sight of the black man caused to the  Christians, for they had never seen a man of his colour before ; they surrounded him  on every side, they gazed at him with astonishment, and thinking he was painted or  dyed with some substance that made him look black, they rushed along, he in the  midst of them, towards the subterranean conduit by means of which the garrison  was supplied with water; and there they began washing and scraping him with  water and a hard brush"" till the black man, unable to endure the operation any  longer, begged them to desist, and explained to them that he was a human creature  like themselves; which being understood by them they left off washing him,  although they still continued to stare at him as a thing they had never seen before.  However, after seven days’ imprisonment, during which the Christians never ceased  coming round him and looking at him, the Almighty permitted that one night this  black man should effect his escape, and arrive safe at the camp of the Amir  Mugheyth, to whom he related his adventures, informing him at the same time of  the result of his observations, as well as of the direction of the subterranean conduit  which supplied the garrison with water. Immediately after Mugheyth summoned  before him some expert people, who looked for the conduit in the place pointed out  by the black man, and, having found it, succeeded in stopping it; the church was  from that moment deprived of water, and its garrison doomed to death.  Notwithstanding this loss, and that the besieged had no hopes of deliverance,  they were so obstinate that when safety was offered to them upon condition either  of embracing the Mohammedan religion, or paying tribute, they refused to surrender,  and the church being set on fire they all perished in the flames. This was the  cause of the spot being called ever since Kentsatu-l-harakt (the church of the  burning),'* as likewise of the great veneration in which it has always been held  by the Christians, on account of the courage and endurance displayed in the cause     Battle of Gua.  dalete,    272 HISTORY OF THE MOQAMMEDAN [BooK Iv.    “heard numerous accounts of this island, you must know how the Grecian  “‘ maidens, as handsome as Huris, their necks glittering with innumerable pearls  ‘‘ and jewels, their bodies clothed with tunics of costly silks sprinkled with gold,  “‘ are waiting your arrival, reclining on soft couches in the sumptuous palaces of  “crowned lords and princes.

No sooner was he aware of it, than, impelled  by his adventurous humour, he took the same direction, repaired to the river, feigned  a purpose similar to that of the barbarian, and, jumping into the water, made him  his prisoner ; he then conducted him to his camp, where the barbarian discovered  himself, and said he was the governor of the city, upon which the Arab general  granted him peace on the usual terns of paying tribute, and dismissed him free to  return to the city, where, as soon as he was returned, he fulfilled his word by  surrendering it to‘the Arabs.   In the meanwhile God filled with terror and alarm the hearts of the idolaters, and  their consternation was greatly increased when they saw Térik penetrate far into  their country ; for, as we have said elsewhere, they were under a belief that his  object in the attack was only to gain spoil and then return to his country. When,  therefore, they saw Térik advance to further conquests they were seized with despair, °     276 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book 1v,    and, abandoning the flat country, fled to the mountains, or betook themselves to  their strong castles; a few only of the principal people repaired to the capital,  Toledo, with the intention of holding out resistance within its walls. It is said  that T4rik, too, endeavoured to increase the terror of the Christians by means  of the following stratagem :—he directed his men to cook the flesh of the slain in  presence of the Gothic captives in his camp, and when the flesh had thus been  cooked in large copper vessels he ordered it to be cut up, as if it were to be distri-  buted to his men for their meals ; he after this allowed some of the captives to  escape, that they might report to their countrymen what they had seen. And thus  the stratagem produced the desired effect, since the report of the fugitives contri-  buted in no small degree to increase the panic of the infidels.”     CHAP.

Tarik divides his army—Mugheyth besieges Cordova—Takes the governor prisoner—Malaga and  Granada taken by Térik’s lieutenants—Theodomir attacked—Besieged in Orihuela—Capitulates—  Siege and taking of Toledo by Térik—Spoils found by Térik—Misa prepares to cross over to Andalus  —Rebellion at Seville—Miusa goes to Toledo—The table of Suleymén described.    ‘    Arrse this they say that Ily4n addressed Térik in the following words :—‘ Since as i divides  “ thy enemies are panic-struck, and their armies dispersed, proceed to their capital, :  “and destroy them before they have time to collect their forces again. Take   “expert guides from among my people; divide thy army into’ bodies, and send   “them to different parts of the country, and, if thou follow my advice, thou wilt   “thyself take a division of it and march towards Toledo, where their great men   “are by this time assembled to deliberate upon their affairs, and unite under a   “ chief of their choosing.”   Térik assented immediately to the advice given by Ily4n, but, before leaving Ezija, Muetey™  he dispatched Mugheyth Ar-rém{ (the Greek), a freedman of the Sult4n Al-walid, Cordove.  son of ’Abdu-l-malek, with seven hundred horse; for the Moslems by this time  were all, without exception, mounted on horses taken from the barbarians, and  had even some remaining. Mugheyth’s instructions were to attack Cordova, one  of their principal cities. Térik sent another division of his army against Malaga,’  and a third against Gharnattd,? the town of Al-birah (Elvira), while he himself, at  the head of the main body, hastened towards Toledo by way of Jaen: some authors  pretend that Térik himself went to Cordova,? and not Mugheyth, but the former  account is the most certain.   However, those who follow the first opinion relate the affair in the following  manner. They say that Mugheyth’s army, having arrived close to Cordova, en-’  camped in a forest of lofty pines * on the bank® of the river of Shakandah. Having  soon after his arrival at the spot sent out his scouts® to gain if possible a knowledge  of the country, these soon returned with a shepherd, who, being interrogated about     278 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book Iv.    Cordova, informed Mugheyth that the principal people of the city had quitted it and  gone to Toledo, but that a governor had been left behind with a garrison of four  hundred horsemen, besides the invalids and old soldiers.7?_ The shepherd being  further questioned respecting the walls of the city said that they were strong and  high, but that there was a breach in them, which he described. Accordingly, no  sooner were the Moslems enveloped in the shadows of night than they set off  towards the city, and approached its walls, where God Almighty opened to them the  means of success, by sending a providential fall of hail, which prevented the stepping  of the horses from being heard. The Moslems proceeded gently and unnoticed till  they arrived on the banks of the river,® which they crossed, finding themselves then  at a distance of only thirty cubits, or perhaps less, from the walls. Owing to the  squalls of rain, and the cold of the night, the sentries, neglecting their duties, were  not on the walls keeping guard, a circumstance which allowed the Moslems to arrive  unheard and unmolested at the foot of the battlements; they then attempted to  scale the walls, but failed in their attempt by not finding a place to fix the  ladders. In this difficulty they returned to the shepherd, and asked him to lead  them to the breach he had mentioned ; this the man did, but it was also found upon  trial not to be of easy ascent. However, this was after some time obtained by  means of a fig tree, growing close to the walls, the branches of which afforded the  means of ascending. One of their strongest men mounted the tree, whence he  succeeded in gaining the top of the breach. Mugheyth then unfolded his turban,  and gave one end of it to the man, who by means of it succeeded in helping others  on until a considerable number of Moslems gained the summit of the wall.  Mugheyth, who remained on horseback at the foot of the battlements, then com-  manded the assailant party to rush upon the guard within the city. This order was  quickly obeyed by the Moslems, who surprised and killed many of the garrison,  and, breaking open the gate, let in Mugheyth and the rest of his men, who soon got  possession of the city. This being done, Mugheyth, with his guides, hastened  towards the palace of the governor, who, having received intelligence of the entry of  the Moslems, fled with his guards, four hundred in number, and betook himself to a  church situate at the west® of the city, and fortified himself in it. As water was  conveyed under ground to this church from a spring at the foot of a neighbouring  mountain, the besieged defended themselves some time against Mugheyth, who  nevertheless ruled in the city and its environs.   The same authors, namely, those who pretend that T4rik was not present at the  taking of Cordova, and that this exploit was achieved singly by Mugheyth, state  that this latter general, after writing to Tarik to apprise him of his victory, con-  tinued to besiege the Christians shut up in the church. After three months of siege,     CHAP. I1I.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 279    seeing that he could not reduce them, Mugheyth began to grow impatient and  melancholy, and thought of devising some stratagem that might make him master  of the fortress. He then called before him one of his black slaves, whose name  was Rabdh, a man of tried courage and fortitude, and directed him to hide  himself at night in a garden covered with trees"" that lay close to the church, to try  if he could not by chance lay hold of some barbarian, who might inform him of the  state of the garrison. The black man did as he was ordered, but being a stupid  fellow he soon committed himself ; for as it was then the season for the trees to bear  fruit, and the place was covered with them, he mounted one in order to gather  some fruit, and eat of it. While he was thus perched in the tree he was discovered  by the people of the church, who, coming to the spot, made him get down, and  having secured him took him prisoner inside. Great was the fright, and at the  same time the astonishment, which the sight of the black man caused to the  Christians, for they had never seen a man of his colour before ; they surrounded him  on every side, they gazed at him with astonishment, and thinking he was painted or  dyed with some substance that made him look black, they rushed along, he in the  midst of them, towards the subterranean conduit by means of which the garrison  was supplied with water; and there they began washing and scraping him with  water and a hard brush” till the black man, unable to endure the operation any  longer, begged them to desist, and explained to them that he was a human creature  like themselves ; which being understood by them they left off washing him,  although they still continued to stare at him as a thing they had never seen before.  However, after seven days’ imprisonment, during which the Christians never ceased  coming round him and looking at him, the Almighty permitted that one night this  black man should effect his escape, and arrive safe at the camp of the Amir  Mugheyth, to whom he related his adventures, informing him at the same time of  the result of his observations, as well as of the direction of the subterranean conduit  which supplied the garrison with water. Immediately after Mugheyth summoned  before him some expert people, who looked for the conduit in the place pointed out  by the black man, and, having found it, succeeded in stopping it; the church was  from that moment deprived of water, and its garrison doomed to death.  Notwithstanding this loss, and that the besieged had no hopes of deliverance,  they were so obstinate that when safety was offered to them upon condition either  of embracing the Mohammedan religion, or paying tribute, they refused to surrender,  and the church being set on fire they all perished in the flames. This was the  cause of the spot being called ever since Kentsatu-l-harakt (the church of the  burning),'> as likewise of the great veneration in which it has always been held  by the Christians, on account of the courage and endurance displayed in the cause     Takes the  governor  prisoner.    Malaga and  Granada taken  by Térik’s  lieutenants.    280 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book Iv.    _ of their religion by the people who died in it. Their commander, however, did    not share their fate, for, when he perceived that the case was desperate, and saw  that he and his followers were doomed to certain death, he abandoned his com-  rades to their fate and escaped towards Toledo. But Mugheyth, being informed of  it, galloped off immediately in pursuit of him, and overtook him near the village of  Talavera.* They say that the barbarian rode a black steed,’® a noble and swift  animal, and that when he saw Mugheyth close at his heels he was terrified and  spurred his horse, but the beast gave a start and threw him down. When  Mugheyth came up he found him stunned by the fall and lying on his shield as if  he were dead, seeing which he took possession of his arms and made him prisoner.   This feat of arms of Mugheyth is differently related by the historians. They all  agree, it is true, in the taking of the church after a considerable resistance, and the  flight and capture of the governor, but some relate this event as having happened  before, not after, the reduction of the fortified church, and say that after taking  the governor prisoner Mugheyth invested the building where the Christians had  taken refuge, and, having reduced it, put every one of them to the sword: the  same historians asserting that the church was called ever since Kentsatu-l-asrat  (the church of the captives). Be this as it may, certain it is that Mugheyth made  the governor of Cordova prisoner, and’ spared his life with the intention of pre-  senting him to the Khalif Al-walid on his return to the East, this Christian being  the only captive of the royal blood of the Goths taken at the time of the conquest,  the rest having either surrendered on terms which secured them their liberty or  escaped to Galicia. However, as we shall presently see, Mugheyth was not able  to accomplish his purpose, for some time afterwards a dispute having arisen between  him and Misa as to whose province it was to present the royal captive to the  Khalif, the latter, seeing that he could not prevail upon Mugheyth to relinquish  his prize, slew the Gothic slave in the very presence of his master. .   After the taking of Cordova, Mugheyth assembled all the Jews in the city and  left them in charge of it, trusting them in preference to the Christians, on account  of their hatred and animosity towards the latter. He then fixed his abode in the  palace, and left the rest of the town to be inhabited by the Moslems.   In the meanwhile the forces that proceeded against Malaga '* took possession of  that town, the barbarians flying for refuge to the neighbouring mountains. After  this they joined the army dispatched to Elvira, and laying siege to its city, Ghar-  nattah,’”” took it by storm. The citadel of this latter place they intrusted to the  care of the Jews, and this practice became almost general in the succeeding years ;  for whenever the Moslems conquered a town, it was left in custody of the Jews,  with only a few Moslems, the rest of the army proceeding to new conquests,     CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. . 281    and where Jews were deficient a proportionally greater body of Moslems was  left in charge.'® This plan was equally adopted with regard to the district of  Rayah, to which Malaga belonged.   After the subjection of these two cities, the army proceeded on to Tudmir, ag""!  country so called after its king (Theodomir), and the citadel of which was Ouriwwélah  (Orihuela),'® a place renowned for its strength. This King Tudmir (Theodomir) was  aman of great experience and judginent, who for a length of time defended his  states valiantly.” But at last, having ventured a battle in the open country, he was  completely defeated, and most of his men slain, himself and a few followers only  succeeding in gaining Orihuela. When safe inside the town, he ordered the  women to let their hair loose, to arm themselves with bows, and to appear on  the walls as if they were so many warriors prepared for battle, he himself,  with his scanty followers, standing in front, with a view to deceive the Mos-  lems with regard to the real strength of the garrison. In this stratagem he Besieged in  succeeded, for the Moslems, overrating his forces by the numbers they saw on  the walls, offered him peace, and Theodomir, feigning to accept of it, repaired  in disguise to the camp of the Moslems; and there, as if he were a deputy from  his own people, he first treated for the security of the inhabitants, and afterwards  for his own. When he had brought the Moslems to grant him the terms which  he wished for, he made himself known to them, giving as an excuse for his  stratagem the great love he had for his subjects, and his ardent wish of obtaining  for them a favourable capitulation. He then guided them into the town, according Capitulates.  to the treaty agreed upon, but when the Moslems saw that there were in it only  women and children, they were very much ashamed of themselves, and mortified  at having been deceived. They, however, observed faithfully the terms of the  treaty, as it was their custom to do on every occasion; so that the district of  Tudmir, by the artifice of its king, was freed from the invasions of the Moslems,  and the whole of its towns and villages were comprised in the same capitulation.  The Moslems wrote to Térik, apprising him of the surrender of that district,  and a small portion of the army remaining in the capital of the country, the  test proceeded to Toledo to join in the siege of that city.”   The taking of Malaga and Granada by Térik’s lieutenants has been called into  question by some historians, who attribute it, together with that of Valencia,  Denia, and other cities of the eastern district, to ’Abdu-l-a’la, one of Miisa’s  sons, who landed in Andalus with his father some time after. Even the war made  against Theodomir, and the treaty concluded with him, are by some postponed  until the year ninety-four (beginning 6th October, 712). Ibnu-l-khattib,” in his  history of Granada, says that Muisa sent his son ’Abdu-l-a’la to Tudmir, then   VOL. 1. 20     282 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book Iv.    to Granada, and lastly to Malaga, all which places he reduced in succession.  But God only knows which of these is the true account, for there is so much  discrepancy in the writings of ancient authors, that to choose among their con-  tradictory accounts becomes a task of the greatest difficulty for the modern  historian.*  sicee Mtoleta While these events were taking place, Térik, according to Ibnu Hayydn, reached  by Tarik. Toledo, the court and capital of the Gothic monarchy, and found it deserted, the  inhabitants having fled and betaken themselves to a town dependent on it beyond  the mountains.* Tarik collected together the Jews of the place, and, leaving  behind a body of his troops in charge of the city, marched with the remainder  in pursuit of the fugitives. He took the road of W4da-l-hijérah (the river of the  stones) ;?° he then came to a range of mountains, which he crossed at a pass named  after himself (Fej-Térik),?” and arrived at Medinatu-l-méyidah (the city of the table),  beyond the mountains, this city being so called from a table which Tarik found in  it, and which is supposed to have belonged to Suleymén, son of Daétid. The colour  / of it was green, and its sides and feet, the latter of which are represented as three  hundred and sixty-five in number,* were made of solid emerald. Tarik took pos-  session of this inestimable jewel, and proceeded to the city beyond the mountains in  which the people had fortified themselves,” and where he also acquired many pre-  cious objects and considerable treasures, after which he did not push his conquests  any further, but returned to Toledo in the year ninety-three * (beginning October,  A.D. 711), although some authors are of opinion that he did not return this time,  but, on the contrary, invaded the country of Galicia, and traversed it till he arrived  as far as Astorga, which he subdued, as well as the neighbouring country, and then  came back to Toledo. But God only knows which of these two opinions is the true  one. It is even said that all these conquests were achieved by Térik against the  express injunctions of his master Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, who, hearing of his success  on the banks of the Guadalete, sent him orders not to advance any further into the  country, but to stop where he was. Be this as it may, one thing is certain, namely,  that Térik went on subduing and conquering the country till the arrival of his  master Miisa Ibn Nosseyr, as we shall afterwards have occasion to relate.*'  arrene""’ ‘The spoils collected by Tarik in his expedition to Toledo are universally repre-  sented as almost innumerable, and as baffling all description by the richness of their  materials, and their admirable workmanship. Besides the table of Suleyman be-  fore alluded to, and to which we shall return in the course of our narrative, a  certain historian has preserved us a list of the precious objects found in the  principal church at Toledo, namely, five-and-twenty gold crowns, one for each  of the Gothic monarchs * who had reigned over Andalus, (it being a custom of     CHAP. 111.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 283    that nation that each of their kings should deposit in that sacred spot a gold  diadem, having his name, figure, and condition, the number of children he left,  the length of his life, and that of his reign, engraven on it ;) one-and-twenty copies  of the Pentateuch, the Gospel, or the Psalms; the book of Abraham, and that of  Moses ; several other books containing secrets of nature and art, or treating about  the manner of using plants, minerals, and living animals, beneficially for man;  another which contained talismans of ancient Greek philosophers, and a collection of  recipes of simples and elixirs ; several gold vases filled with pearls, rubies, emeralds,  topazes, and every description of precious stones; many lofty rooms filled with  gold and tissue robes, and tunics of every variety of costly silk and satin, without  counting gilt armour, richly set daggers and swords, bows, spears, and all sorts  of offensive and defensive weapons. But to return to the main subject of our  narrative.   According to Ibnu Hayyén and other historians, when Térik had defeated the Miss preveres  entire forces of the Gothic empire, with King Roderic at their head, on the banks ” so  of the Guadalete, he hastened to communicate to his master Misa Ibn Nosseyr |  the news of the signal victory which God Almighty had granted to his arms.  But, instead of congratulating himself upon his freedman’s success, the Arabian  Amir grew jealous and spiteful, and, fearing lest, by prosecuting the conquest,  Tarik should take all the spoil and the glory to himself, and leave none for him,  sent Tarik a severe reprimand because he had attacked without his orders, together  with an injunction not to move from where he was until he should join him.  Accordingly, having made a few hasty preparations, he crossed over to Andalus,  leaving his eldest son ’Abdullah to command at Cairwan in his stead, and, taking  with him Habib Ibn ’Abdah Al-fehri, and three of his other sons, Merwan,  *Abdu-l-a’la, and ’Abdu-l-’aziz, landed on the coast of Andalus in the month of  Ramadhén of the year ninety-three (August, a.p. 712), or, according to others,  in the month of Rejeb of the same year (June, a.p. 712). The number of troops  which Musa led to this expedition has been differently calculated ; some say ten  thousand men, others say eighteen,®* others make their number still more con-  siderable. Muisa brought in his suite several noble Arabs of the best families of  Yemen, and the countries subject to the Moslems. In their number came several  of the ¢dbi’s (followers), as Hansh™* Ibn ’Abdillah As-san’4ni, ’Abdu-r-rahman  Tbn ’Abdillah Ibn Yezid Al-bajeli, ’Abdu-r-rahmén Ibn Shamdsah* Al-misri,  Abi-l-nadhar Hayyan Ibn Abi Hoblah,* a mauli of the Beni ’Abdi-d-dar ; some  add Jebel Ibn Hasanah*’ and others, to complete the number of twenty-five.   Some time before Miisa left Africa news reached him how TArik, disobeying his  orders, had penetrated far into the country, and had subdued either by himself or     284 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [BOOK lv.    his lieutenants the principal cities of the land, amassing an immense spoil. He  therefore determined to hasten to Andalus, and punish his freedman for advancing  against his express orders. He sailed from Ceuta, and, avoiding the mountain  where Tarik had landed, disembarked at a spot which was since called after him  Jebal-Misa* (the mountain of Misa). Thence he proceeded to Algesiras, where  he is said to have expressed his wish not to follow the same route which Tarik had  taken. Some of Ilydn’s people,” who served him as guides, then told him, ‘‘ We  “* will take thee a shorter road than his, and conduct thee to cities more populous  “‘ and wealthy than those which he has conquered ; cities, too, which no conqueror  “‘ has yet subdued, but which, if such be God’s will, will surrender to thee.”  Delighted with this account Misa followed his guides, for the idea of having been  outstripped by Térik in the conquest annoyed him much. They led him along the  coast of Shidhinah (Sidonia),*° which place he took by storm, the inhabitants  imploring his mercy ; thence he proceeded to Karmtinah (Carmona),*' the strongest  city in Andalus, and the best calculated for defence against a besieging enemy, but  he gained it through a stratagem which he devised. Ilydn’s people entering it as  if they were a small body of friends fleeing from the enemy, they approached it in  the night, when, throwing the gates open, they admitted the Moslems, who rushed  upon the guards, and made themselves masters of the town.*? Misa next pro-  ceeded to Seville, the largest and most important city of Andalus for its buildings  and its ancient remains. It had been the capital of the country in ancient times,  and remained such until the conquest of Andalus by the Goths, at which time  these transferred the seat of government to Toledo, as we have observed elsewhere ;  still the heads of the church resided there,** and Seville was considered one of  the principal cities in Andalus. Owing to this the city withstood for some  time** the attacks of Misa, but at last that general entered it by force of  arms, and the barbarians fled to Bajah (Beja). Musa collected the Jews in the  citadel, and left a body of his own troops for the defence of the place, he himself  passing on to Merida, which had also been formerly the seat of government under  some of the kings of the country. This city was of considerable size and great  strength; in it were the remains of palaces, temples of vast size and exquisite  workmanship; and other public buildings. Musa laid siege to it, but the people,  being brave and determined, repulsed the Moslems several times with great loss.  Miisa then had a war-engine* constructed, by means of which the Moslems  approached one of the towers under cover, and began undermining the wall; but  this also proved ineffectual, for no sooner had they begun to displace and remove  the stones than they found themselves in an open space, a kind of work which the  barbarians call in their language Al-eshah meshah:** having there laid down‘’ their     CHAP. III.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 285    pickaxes and other working instruments they were suddenly attacked by the enemy,  who slew many Moslems under that machine, whence the spot where this de-  plorable event took place received the name of Borju-sh-shohodd (the tower  of the martyrs). After this Misa offered to treat with the besieged on terms  of peace; accordingly a deputation, composed of the principal inhabitants, came  forth from the city to settle with him the conditions. Having obtained a safe  conduct the deputies reached the camp of the Moslems, where Mtisa made use  of the following stratagem to deceive and astonish them: he received them the  first time with his white hair and beard both undressed. Not having agreed  then, the deputies returned back to the city, and appeared again before him on  the day before the feast of Al-fitr;** but what was their astonishment to behold  his beard, which he had tinged with hinna,“ dyed of deep red, resembling  that of the branches of the ’arfaj.° Again not having come to a perfect under-  standing, the deputies returned to the city, and when they came to visit Misa  the next day, they were still more astonished to see his hair and beard entirely «  black, a circumstance which filled them with amazement, for the barbarians were \  totally unacquainted with the practice of staining and dressing the beard. When |  they went back to the city they said to their countrymen, ‘“‘ Know ye that we have   “ to fight a nation of prophets,*' who can change their appearance at pleasure, and  “transform themselves into any shape they like. We have seen their king, who  “was an old man, become a young one; so our advice is this, that we should   “‘ go to him and grant him his demands, for people like them we cannot resist.” *?  To this the people submitted, and peace was concluded with Misa on the following  conditions, namely, that the property of all citizens slain during the siege, as well   as that of those who had fled to Galicia, together with all the riches and ornaments   of the churches, should be given up to the Moslems, but that to all others residing   in the city at the time of the capitulation should be left the undisturbed possession   of their property. Upon these terms the city surrendered on the day of the festival   of Al-fitr, of the year ninety-four (beginning 6th October, 712).   In the meantime, and while Misa was occupied in the conquest of Merida, the Rebellion a  inhabitants of Seville, assisted by those of Beja and Liblah (Niebla), revolted against  the Moslems, and killed about eighty men belonging to the garrison ; in consequence  of which, after the surrender of Merida, Musa dispatched his son ’Abdu-l-’aziz with  an army against the insurgents. He first marched to Seville, which he took,  making great slaughter among its inhabitants ; he then proceeded to Niebla, which  he reduced also, and, after re-establishing his authority and upholding Islam in  those districts, came back to Seville, where he fixed himself, making it the capital  of the Mohammedan conquests.”     Masa goes to  Toledo.    The table of  Suleyman  described.    286 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN (Book tv.    About the end of the month of Shaww4l® of the same year (ninety-four), Misa  left Merida to go to Toledo, and when Térik was informed of his arrival he went  out to receive him with his principal officers, and met him in the district of Talavera.  This is according to some historians, for others say that from Merida he proceeded to  Galicia, which he entered by the mountain pass called Fej-Tdrik (the pass of Tarik) ,*  and traversed the whole of that country until he overtook Térik, the leader of the  van of his army, at Astorga. But the former account is the most probable, besides  being adopted by the best writers. All agree, however, that Misa’s reception of  his freedman was both unnatural and unjust,—that he reprimanded him severely for  advancing contrary to his orders into the heart of the country, and manifested in  public all the envy and animosity he had conceived against him. They say, also,  that the moment Térik perceived his master he alighted from his horse, out of  respect, and to do him honour, but that Misa struck him with his whip,”  reproached him with his disobedience, and upbraided him before all the army  for acting against his orders. He then took Térik with him to Toledo, where  he summoned him to produce all the spoil gained from the enemy at the taking  of that town, and especially the famous table of Suleyman, son of David, for which  he seemed to wish more eagerly than for any other article found at the time of the  conquest.   We have already said something on this inestimable jewel, descriptions of which  are to be met with in almost every book on the history or geography of Andalus.  These, however, are not all alike, since by some the materials of the table are said  to be pure gold, by others green emerald. Some describe it as being made of gold  and silver, and having round it a row of pearls, another of rubies, and a third of  emeralds, and being, besides, strewed with innumerable precious gems ; others make  its substance to be solid emerald, and pretend that it had three hundred and sixty-  five feet ; others again say that it was all set with a variety of precious stones, and  incrusted with all sorts of aromatic woods, and that the whole was covered with  inscriptions in Greek. But as that trustworthy and accurate historian, Ibnu  Hayy4n, has preserved a description of this table, as well as an account of its  origin, we’ shall refer to him.   His words are as follow :—‘ The celebrated table which Tarik found: at Toledo,  “although attributed to Suleyman, and named after him, never belonged to that  “ Prophet, according to the barbarian authors, who give it the following origin.  ‘« They say that in the time of their ancient kings it was customary amongst them  “ for every man of estimation and wealth’ to bequeath, before dying, some of  “‘his property to the churches. From the money so collected the priests caused  “tables to be made of pure gold and silver, besides thrones and huge stands,*®     CHAP. 111.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 287    “for the priests, deacons, and attendants to carry the gospels when taken out at  ‘‘ public processions, or to ornament the altars ® on great festivals. By means of  “such bequests this table was wrought at Toledo, and was afterwards emulously in-  “ creased and embellished by each succeeding monarch, the last trying always to sur-  “ pass his predecessors in magnificence, until it became the most splendid and costly  “ jewel that ever was made for such a purpose, and acquired great celebrity. The  “ fabric was of pure gold, set with the most precious pearls, rubies, and emeralds ;  “around it was a row of each of those valuable stones, and the whole table was  “ besides covered with jewels so large and bright that never did human eye behold  “any thing comparable to it. Toledo being the capital of the kingdom, there was  “no jewel, however costly, no article, however precious, which could not be pro-  “cured in it; this and other causes concurred to ornament and embellish that  “ inestimable object. When the Moslems entered Toledo it was found on the great  “altar of their principal church, and the fact of such a treasure having been  “ discovered soon became public and notorious.”   Tarik soon perceived by the haste that his master Misa made to come from  Africa, and his eagerness to demand from him the spoils acquired, that he was  devoured by envy ; he, accordingly, decided upon taking away one of the legs of the  table, which he kept concealed, and which afterwards became, as we shall see, his  principal argument against Musa, when in the presence of the Khalif the latter  disputed with him the possession of this jewel, which he pretended to have found  himself.   Arrived in Toledo, Miisa asked Tarik to produce the table of Suleyman, and the  order being instantly obeyed, it was brought to the presence of the Arabian general,  who, seeing it with only three feet instead of four,®' immediately questioned Tarik  respecting it. Tarik answered, that he had found it thus; upon which Miisa caused  a foot of pure gold, handsomer than which none could be procured, to be wrought ;  and notwithstanding its great disparity, (the other three being made of emerald,) to  be fixed to the table, which he laid carefully up until he should present it himself to  the Khalif Al-walid as the fruit of the Andalusian conquest.   After this Misa is represented as having cast Tarik into prison, and as meditating  his death, which he would have accomplished had not a messenger of the Khalif  arrived in Andalus with orders to set him at liberty, and restore him to the com-  mand of the troops. However, it appears by Ibnu Hayydn’s narrative that he soon  restored to him his confidence and friendship ; when, uniting their forces, they both  proceeded to new conquests, and speedily subdued the remainder of Andalus.",book_4,chapter_3

He then  gave him orders to march before him with his division, Misa himself following him  with the main body of the troops. Taking the route of Ath-thagheru-l-a’lt (Aragon),  they subdued Saragossa and its districts, and continued to penetrate far into the  country,’ Tarik preceding him, and not passing a place without reducing it, and  getting possession of its wealth, for God Almighty had struck with terror the hearts  of the infidels, and no one came before him but to ask for peace. Misa followed  the track of Tarik, achieving the conquests begun by him, and confirming to the  inhabitants the conditions agreed upon by his lieutenant. When the whole of that  country had been subdued, such of the Moslems as consulted their safety were of  opinion that they should return, while others, and they were the greater number,  They invade eagerly desired to penetrate into the land of the Franks. Accordingly Musa, after  devoting some time to make the necessary selection of those who volunteered to go  with him from those who preferred remaining, proceeded with the rest to the country  of the Franks, a land where the Moslems after them never ceased making conquests,  gaining spoil, storming cities or granting them peace on the usual terms, till they  reached the river Rodhanoh (Rhone), which was the furthest limit of their con-  quests and incursions in the country of the barbarians. Indeed, the bands which  Tarik had led to Andalus subdued also the country of Afranj, and made them-  selves the masters of the two cities of Barcelona and Narbonne, of the rock of  Abenitin? (Avignon), and of the fortress of Lidhiin (Lyons), on the banks of  the Rhone, the Moslems advancing far into the country and separating them-  selves considerably from the shore by which they had penetrated. The distance  between Narbonne, in the country of Afranj, and Cordova is, according to some,     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 289    three hundred and thirty-five farsangs, according to others, three hundred and  fifty.   How far Misa pushed his conquests into the land of the Franks is not explicitly  related by the historians of Andalus. Some say that after the taking of Saragossa  he went eastwards into the country of the Franks,‘ subduing on his passage  Gerona, Calahorra, Tarragona, Barcelona, and other principal cities of those  districts. Others say that he penetrated as far as Narbonne and Carcassonne,  both of which he subdued. They relate that on his way to one of those cities  he crossed a great desert, where he saw the ruins® of ancient buildings scat-  tered on the ground, and among them a colossal monument, like a-column, rising  high into the air, bearing the following inscriptions engraven in Arabic cha-  racters on the stone. ‘‘O sons of Isma’il, hither you will arrive, hence you must  “return ;” and on the other side, ‘‘ for if you go beyond this stone you will return  “ to your country to make war upon one another, and consume your forces by dis-  “ sensions and civil war.””® Miisa was terrified at the mysterious meaning of these  expressions ; he called his men together, and consulted them as to whether they  should go back or advance beyond the column; the opinions were divided, but  the greater part wishing to return, Miisa followed their advice, and retreated with  his army into Andalus, after having seen enough of the country to judge of the  boundless plains that lay before him.   Tbnu Khaldiin’s words are as follows: ‘‘ Having met his master, Musa Ibn  “ Nosseyr, Térik resigned the command of his troops into his hands, and placed  “himself under his immediate orders. Miuisa then completed the conquest of  “ Andalus, and, led by him, the Moslem armies reached as far as Barcelona in the  “ east, Narbonne in the north, and the idol of Cadiz in the west, subduing all the  “intermediate provinces and gaining incredible spoil. It is confidently believed  “ that, elated with success, Misa conceived the project of returning to the East by  “‘ way of Constantinople ; for which purpose he intended to march from Andalus  “at the head of his brave troops, until, by making his way through the countless  “ Christian nations that inhabit the great continent, he should arrive at the court of  “the eastern Khalifs. However, this design having reached the ears of Al-walid,  “who well knew the state of Mohammedan affairs in Andalus, and feared that if  “ Misa once communicated his intention to his army they would all follow him, he  “ dispatched to him a messenger to signify his displeasure, and to order him to  “desist from his rash enterprise, and to appear alone, without his army, in the  “ Khalif’s presence.” So far Ibnu Khaldin.   Another historian says that Musa penetrated into the continent and reached as  far as a city called Carcassonne, which is twenty-five days’ march from Cordova ;7   VOL. I. 2P     290 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book Iv.    and that, having reduced it, he found in its principal church, called Santa Maria,   seven columns of massive silver, the like of which no human eye ever beheld, and   the circumference of which was such that a single man could not embrace them.*®   But all these accounts are contradicted by other writers, who pretend that after   approaching the Pyrenees, without invading the land of the Franks lying beyond   those mountains, he returned and invaded Galicia. But let us hear Al-hijari in  “his Mas‘hab.   “God Almighty bestowed his favours on Misa Ibn Nosseyr in a manner that  ‘* cannot be surpassed, since he vanquished the Christian kings, and dispersed their  “* armies like the dust, till he penetrated into the continent by one of the gates in  “ that chain of mountains that divides Andalus from Afranj: it is related that the  ‘* Franks flocked immediately under the banners of their great king K4roloh, (for  ‘* such was the appellation of their kings,)° and said to him, ‘ What is the meaning  ‘* of this our ignominy and shame, which will rest as a stigma on our posterity? We  “ hear about these Arabs sprung from the East, and are informed of their conquests  ** and of their arrival in the West, subduing the neighbouring kingdom of Andalus,  “* notwithstanding the numerous armies and considerable resources of that empire ;  ‘* and yet these Arabs, we are told, are scanty in numbers, badly equipped and pro-  ‘‘ vided, and do not wear armour:’ and Kéroloh answered them, ‘ My opinion is  “ that we should not oppose these people in their first irruption, for they resemble  ‘* the mountain torrent, which surmounts every obstacle in its course; they are now  “in the height of prosperity, and, instead of being abated, their courage is only  “increased at the sight of the enemy; their proud hearts scorn the defence of a  “* cuirass. Let them alone until their hands are well loaded with spoil, for when they  “ have settled in this country and established their government, they will then vie  “‘ for command, and fight with one another for the acquisition of it. That will be  “ the time and occasion for our attacking them, and I doubt not but that we shall  “ easily vanquish them :’ and by Allah so it was; for in the civil wars that soon  “ afterwards broke out between the Syrians and the Beladis,’° the Berbers and the  ‘* Arabs, the tribes sprung from Modhar, and those of Yemen, the Moslems divided  ‘* into factions, made war upon each other, and lent each other assistance against  “ the people of their own nation, their brethren in country and religion.”   It is also reported that Musa Ibn Nosseyr sent his son ’Abdu-l-a’la' against  Tudmir, and also against Granada, Malaga, and the district of Raya, which cities  he entirely subdued. On this occasion they tell the following adventure of ’Abdu-  1-a’la at the siege of Malaga. They say that the governor of that city was a stupid —  man, and one who did not much care for the safety of the town. Not liking to  endure the fatigues and privations of the siege, he used to go out to a garden of his,     CHAP. IV.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 291    where he retired to enjoy the pleasures of the country. This he did frequently, but  without taking the necessary precautions of appointing scouts or stationary sentries  on places commanding the country, so that he might be informed of ’Abdu-l-a’la’s  arrival. No sooner, therefore, was the Arabian Amir informed of this circumstance  by his spies than he prepared an ambush for him, and concealing a small body  of his best and most experienced horsemen near the walls of the garden where the  governor was, these rushed at night upon the house, surprised him, and made  him their prisoner. The Moslems afterwards took the city by storm, and collected  considerable plunder.   Others, again, say that Miisa was present at all these conquests, and that he    was preparing to attack the land of the infidels,’? the country of Galicia, when aint with    he was prevented by Mugheyth Ar-rimi,'? who was the bearer of an order from his & message from    patron, the Khalif Al-walid, enjoining Miisa to cease his conquests, and, quitting  Andalus, to return to the East with his messenger. This order put a stop to  Misa’s enterprises and marred his intention, for at that time not a single town  remained in Andalus which was not subdued to the Arabs, if we except the country  of Galicia.“ However, Misa had such an ardent wish to push his conquests in  those parts that he prevailed on the envoy, by offering him the half of his own share  of the spoils, to stop until he had accomplished his object, and accompany him a  few days into the heart of the enemy’s country. Mugheyth consented, and marched  with him until he arrived at the frontiers of the enemy’s territory '* and conquered  the fortress of Bézi® and the castle of Lik (Lugo), where they stopped some  time. From thence Miisa sent forward some of his troops, who reached the rock of  Belay (Pelayo),’” on the shores of the Green Sea, destroying on their way all the  churches, and breaking all the bells. The Christians surrendered every where, and  asked humbly for peace, which was granted on condition of their paying tribute.  The Arabs inhabited the towns deserted by the Christians ; for whenever any of the  invaders, whether an Arab or a Berber, received orders to settle in a spot, he not  only approved of it, but established himself with his family in it without reluc-  tance, by means of which the words of Islam spread far into the country, and the  idolatry of the Christians was destroyed and annihilated.   Things were in this state, and Miisa pushing on his conquests into the land of the  Galicians, his hope of success strengthening every day, when a second envoy, whose  name was Abi Nasr, arrived from Syria with orders to stop him in his victorious  career, for the Khalif Al-walid, seeing that his commands were not quickly obeyed,  and that Mugheyth allowed Misa to protract his departure, had now sent this Abi  Nasr with a letter upbraiding Musa, and enjoining him to return immediately, at    Galicia and As-  turias invaded.    Second  message from  Al-walid.     292 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book tv.    the same time directing his messenger to see his orders executed, and Musa on his  way to Syria.'®   Accordingly, in compliance with the Khalif’s commands, Misa started, although  with the greatest reluctance, from Lugo, in Galicia; and, passing through the  gorge of the mountain called after his name Fej-Misa (the mountain pass of Misa),  where he met T4rik returning from his expedition in Aragon, he began his march,  together with such of the army as chose to return, (for many preferred remaining  in the towns where they had settled and fixed their domicile,) and arrived at  Seville, taking with him Tarik, as well as the two messengers, Mugheyth and Abi  Nasr.   Miisa’s de- Before his departure, however, Musa named his son ’Abdu-l-’aziz° governor of   The. te Andalus, and decided that he should fix his residence in Seville, on account of the  proximity of that city to the sea, and to that part of the coast where the troops  coming from Africa usually landed ; and having made this and other arrangements,  having garrisoned the castles on the frontiers, and appointed generals to command  the troops and carry on the war, he embarked for Africa on his way to the East in  the month of Dhi-l-hajjah of the year ninety-four (Sept. a.p. 713), taking with  him Tarik, who had stayed in Andalus three years and four months,” namely, one  year before Miisa’s arrival, and two years and four months after his landing.”!   After staying for some time at Cairwdn, Misa prepared to march, leaving the  government of Africa proper in the hands of his eldest son ""Abdullah, the conqueror  of Mallorca,” that of Maghreb (Western Africa) in those of ’Abdu-l-malek,* the  youngest of his sons: intrusting to his son ’Abdu-l-a’la the command of the coast,  with the garrisoning of Tangiers and other strong places, he moved on in the  ensuing year (ninety-five), preceded by an immense number of waggons and camels  carrying the immense booty and vast riches he had acquired, in which were com-  prised, besides the famous table, such a quantity of precious stones, silver and gold  vases, and other valuable objects, as to surpass all computation by their number  and baffle all description by their materials. He was also followed by thirty  thousand captives taken in war, but with all this he was affected with melancholy  and disappointment, which are said to have caused his death soon after, owing to  his having been checked in his projects of conquest, since, as we have related  elsewhere, some historians attribute to him the design of reducing such parts of  the country as still remained in the hands of the Franks, and after this of invading  the great land (continent), and arriving with his army in Syria; and this he is  supposed to have planned with a view to establish, by the entire subjection of  the intermediate countries, an open and direct communication with the East, that     CHAP. IV.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 293    the people of Andalus might in future receive reinforcements, or visit Syria, without  having to cross the sea and encounter its dangers.   Misa left Africa for Syria in the year ninety-five of the Hijra (beginning Sept. Leases Africa  713), leaving the inhabitants of the towns and villages through which he passed in  utter astonishment at the sight of the immense treasures and numberless curiosities,  being part of the spoil made in Andalus, which preceded him in waggons.   They say that as he was journeying™ towards Syria with his suite, he asked  Mugheyth to deliver into his hands his prisoner, the Gothic nobleman, governor  of Cordova, but this Mugheyth refused to do, answering, ‘‘ Nobody shall present  “him to the Khalif but myself; he is my patron and master, and to him only  “ will I make homage of my prisoner.” Upon which Miisa sprang upon the Goth  and tore him out of the hands of Mugheyth. However, some of his friends having  told him that if he arrived at court with his prisoner, Mugheyth would undoubtedly  claim him before the Khalif, in which case the Goth would not contradict his  assertion, he ordered him to be beheaded, and the sentence was immediately carried  into execution. From this moment Mugheyth conceived a violent hatred against  Misa, and contributed not a little to hurt him afterwards in the mind of the  Khalif by supporting the charges brought against him by Tarik.   Whether Miisa reached Damascus before or after the death of Al-walid is a con- Arve: iv  troverted fact amongst historians. Those who incline to the latter opinion pretend  that Suleyman,” who succeeded his brother in the Khalifate, was ill disposed towards  Misa, owing to charges and complaints laid against him by Tarik and Mugheyth,  who, having preceded him at court, had informed the Khalif of his rapacity and  injustice, and told him how he had appropriated to himself the famous table, and  deprived Mugheyth of his noble captive. Misa was further accused of concealing a  jewel more valuable than any that a king ever possessed since the conquest of Persia.  Accordingly, when Misa arrived in Damascus he found Suleyman very much pre-  judiced against him; that monarch received him angrily, reprimanded him severely,  and cast upon him several imputations and charges, which he tried to answer as well  as he could. He then asked him to produce the table, which being done, Suleyman  said to him, “‘ Térik pretends that it was he, not thou, who found it.” ‘“ Certainly  not,” answered Misa, ‘‘if ever Tarik saw this table, it was in my possession and  “nowhere else.” Then Tarik, addressing the Khalif, requested him to question  Misa about the leg that was wanting, and on Muisa’s answering “‘ that he had  “found it in that state, and that in order to supply the deficiency he had caused  “another leg to be made,” Tarik triumphantly produced from under his tunic  the identical one, which at once convinced Suleyman of the truth of Térik’s  assertion and Miisa’s falsehood. This also led the Khalif to suppose that all the     294 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN [Book Iv.    other charges brought against him were equally correct; he therefore deprived  him of all the riches he had acquired, and banished him to a distant province of  his empire: others say that he imprisoned him, and ordered that he should be  kept with the greatest vigilance ;—that he also fined him very heavily, whereby he  became so poor that he was obliged to beg for his subsistence among the Arabs,  the tribe of Lakhm, to which he belonged, having contributed ninety thousand  pieces of gold towards the payment of his fine, which is said to have amounted to  two hundred thousand. Half of this enormous sum Musa paid down, but he failed  in procuring the means of paying the rest, when, having excited the compassion  of Ibnu-l-muhlib,* a favourite of Suleymén, that courtier interceded for him with  the Khalif, who absolved Miisa from the payment of the remainder and par-  doned him, although he gave orders for the removal of ’Abdullah, his eldest son,  from the government of Africa.   panied The historians who follow the former of the two opinions, namely, that Misa  reached Damascus before the death of Al-walid, relate that when Misa arrived  in Syria the Khalif was indisposed, and that when Suleymdn, who was the pre-  sumptive heir, heard of Miisa’s approach, he wrote requesting him to delay his  entry into Damascus until his brother was dead and himself succeeded to his  throne, that the rich spoils he brought with him might grace his inauguration,  and give him popularity among his subjects, who had never seen or heard of  such an accumulation of riches. This Misa refused to do, from motives of  fidelity to his lawful sovereign, and, hastening his march, arrived in Damascus  while Al-wélid was still alive, and delivered into his hands the fifth of all the  spoil, the fruit of his conquests, besides immense treasure and countless wealth,  and many valuable gifts, all the produce of the plunder collected in Andalus.  However, Al-walid died a very few days afterwards, and his successor, Suleyman,   peered vented his rage against Musa, whom he caused to be imprisoned, and exposed to  the sun till he was almost lifeless. He had him also very heavily fined, and wrote  to his generals in Andalus to murder his son ’Abdu-l-’aziz, whom he had left to  command in his name, as has before been said, and who, in his absence, collected  together the scattered bands of the Arabs, fortified the frontiers, and contributed  greatly to consolidate the conquest, by storming many towns which had escaped his  father’s eye.   Of the two preceding accounts the latter is, in our opinion, entitled to most  credit, since there can be no doubt that Misa was imprisoned and fined in the  year ninety-six (beginning September, 714), at the beginning of which Al-walid  died; and therefore what Ibnu Hayy4n says, that it was Suleyman Ibn ’Ab-  di-l-malek who disgraced and imprisoned Misa, is the true account, and not     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 295    that of Ibn Khallekin, who attributes that act to Al-walid. But God only  knows.   Al-hijari, who is one of the authors who maintain that Misa was ill treated by Su-  leymén, says, in his Mas‘hab, that Misa Ibn Nosseyr begged Yezid Ibnu-l-muhlib,””  who was a favourite with the commander of the faithful, Suleyman Ibn ’Abdi-l-  malek, to intercede for him that he might be more lenient and better disposed  towards him. ‘ Very willingly,” answered Yezid ; ‘let me only first put to thee a  “ question which I desire thee to answer.” ‘‘ What is it?” said Musa. “I have  “ often,” replied Yezid, “‘ heard people speak of thy superior talents, thy great sa-  “ gacity, and thy deep acquaintance with all the casualties of war, as well as with  “ the sudden changes of fortune ; how is it, then, that after conquering Andalus, and  “ putting a boisterous sea between thee and these people, thou now comest to deliver  “ thyself into their hands, like the man who blushed after he had gained his purpose,  “‘ which had cost him much trouble, or like the man who got the skin, and, after  “ tanning and preparing it with his own hands, gave it to his enemy. How is it, I  “ repeat, that thou hast placed thy person in the hands of people who know nothing  “ but thy good and thy evil?”* Thou hadst become the master of treasures and  “ riches, thou hadst subdued castles and cities, thou wast at the head of a numerous  “army, so that hadst thou only made a show of resistance thou wouldst not now  “ find thy head in the hands of a man who has not the least regard or compassion  “for thee. Besides, how couldst thou forget that Suleymdén was the presumptive  “heir to the empire, he having been designated by Al-walid to be his successor,  ‘“‘and that by his brother’s serious illness this event was daily expected? Thou  “must have been ignorant of it, or else thou wouldst not have opposed his will  “and thrown thyself into his power, causing thy own ruin and perdition, and  “‘ making thyself the mark of the hatred both of thy master and of thy slave  “‘ (meaning Suleyman and Tarik). I may tell thee that it will be very difficult  “to persuade the Khalif to restore thee to his favour; however, I promise to do  “all in my power to obtain it.”   Then Misa said, “‘O Ibnu-l-karam! This is not the moment for reproaches.  “ Hast thou not heard it said, that when the occasion is propitious the fountain  ‘is dry?” ‘* By addressing thee in this manner,” replied Yezid, “it is not my  “intention to offend or upbraid thee; my only wish is to gain a better knowledge  “of thy case, and see how matters stand between thee and Suleyman.” ‘ Hast  “thou not heard,” said Musa, “ of the lapwing that is enabled to see the water at  “‘a great depth under ground, and yet falls into the snare which is in sight of his  “ eyes?”   After this Yezid went to see Suleyman, and spoke to him in favour of Misa, but     296 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN {Book iv.    the Khalif’s answer was, that he had already considered the matter, and was decided  to make an example by way of throwing terror among his subjects, and showing  them that he was the arbiter both of their lives and fortunes. ‘‘ However,” con-  tinued the Khalif, ‘I grant you his life, but he shall not be quite absolved until he  ‘‘ restores the treasures of which he has defrauded his God ;” and he fined him  heavily, as before related, owing to which Misa was reduced to such poverty that he  was obliged, adds the author already quoted, to beg for his subsistence among the Arab  tribes, and died in the greatest indigence and misery at Wéda-l-kor4. It is also  asserted, on the authority of one of his slaves,” who accompanied him in his state  of poverty and indigence :—‘‘ I used to go round with the Amir Misa to the different  “ tribes of Arabs, and beg from them our subsistence. Some gave us alms, others  ‘* dismissed us ; some, moved to pity, used to give us one or two dirhems, which  “ caused great satisfaction to the Amir, for he stored them to add to the sum to be  ‘* deposited in the hands of the officers intrusted with the receipt of his fine, in hopes  “ of alleviating his sentence.” Thus was he obliged to beg from door to door,—he  who had seen the meanest soldiers of his army, at the time of the great conquest of  Andalus, enter the palaces and temples, and throw away the gold with which they  were overloaded, in order to seize only on pearls, rubies, and other precious stones.  Praise be given to Him who distributes poverty and wealth as he chooses, and in  ' whose hands are both exaltation and depression !   It is further related, that while Musa was escaping from the violence of the  Khalif, and was in vain seeking an asylum among the Arabs, he found at last in  Wada-l-koré one of his ancient maulis, who, remembering his former engagements,  shared his misfortunes with him, received him in his house, and fed him; until  finding that Misa protracted his stay, and that his means were thereby exhausted,  he determined upon delivering him into the hands of the officers of justice. Musa,  however, guessing his intention, went up to him and addressed him in a very  humble tone of voice, saying to him, ‘ Wilt thou, O friend, betray me in this man-  ney?” and the mauli replied, ‘‘ Against fate there is no complaint. It is not I who  “ betray thee, it is thy master, thy creator, he who gave thee sustenance, who now  “abandons thee.” Upon which Misa raised his eyes, bathed in tears, to the sky,  and humbly besought God to grant him his help and favour in his perilous situation.  On the following day Muisa delivered up his soul.   The author from whom the -preceding is transcribed observes, ‘‘ Whatever  “* Miisa’s faults might have been, certainly he did not deserve so severe a chas-  “tisement. His conduct, and the territories he gained to Islam, ought to have  ‘* moved the heart of Suleyman to pity.

They say that Suleymdn once asked Mtisa what he had observed in his trans-   actions and wars with the infidels. ‘‘ What nations were they ?” inquired the Khalif.  “ They are more than I can enumerate,” replied Misa. ‘‘ Tell me then about the  “ Greeks,°° what sort of people are they ?”’—‘‘ They are lions behind the walls of  “ their cities, eagles upon their horses, and women in their vessels.. Whenever they  “* see an opportunity they sieze it immediately, but if they are vanquished they fly to  “ the tops of their mountains, being so swift that they scarcely see the land which they  “ tread.””—‘ And the Berbers ?”—‘‘ The Berbers are the people who most resemble  “the Arabs in activity, strength, courage, endurance, love of war, and hospitality,  “only that they are the most treacherous of men. They have no faith, and they  “ keep no word.”— Tell me about the Goths.” *\—*‘ The Goths are lords living in  “Juxury and abundance, but champions who do not turn their backs to the  ‘““enemy.”—‘ And the Franks, what are they ?’”—‘‘ They are people of great  “ courage and enterprise ; their numbers are considerable, and they are amply pro-  “ vided with weapons and military stores.”   However, upon the year of Miisa’s death there is but one opinion. Ac¢ording Muss’s death.  to Ibnu Hayydn, Ibnu Bashkiwal, and other historians, he died at Wada-l-kora,*?  in the year ninety-seven (beginning Sept. a. v. 715); he was born in the  year nineteen of the Hijra (beginning Jan. a.p. 640), during the Khalifate of  Omar Ibnu-l-khatt4b, and therefore was sixty years old when he took possession of  the government of Africa in the year seventy-nine. His surname was Abd ’Abdi‘y-  rahman.* “   As to his ancestors there are various opinions; some authors make him Opinions about  the son of Nosseyr, son of Zeyd, of the tribe of Bekr; others of Nosseyr, son origin. —  of ’Abdu-r-rahman, son of Zeyd, of the same tribe. Ibn Khallekan, following  Al-homaydi and other ancient historians, calls him Misa, son of Nosseyr, a mauli*  of the tribe of Lakhm. Some go so far as to say that he was a Berber of mixed -  blood.   Those who incline to the former opinion say that his father, Nosseyr, drew his  origin from those barbarians who, when defeated by Khaled Ibnu-l-walid near ’Aynu-   VOL.

But this is very far from being a settled opinion, for, as we have  already observed, there are not wanting genealogists who make him a mauli of the  tribe of Lakhm, and say that his father, Nosseyr, was captain of the guard *’ of the  Khalif Mu’awiyah Ibn Abi Sufydn, and that when the latter made war against ’Ali,  before the battle of Sefayin, Nosseyr refused to accompany the expedition.. Having  been interrogated by Mu’awiyah as to the cause which prevented him from joining  his army, and made him show himself so ungrateful for past favour, he is said  to have answered, ‘‘It is not in my power to assist thee against one to whom I  “am more indebted than to thee.” ‘“ And who is he?” replied Mu’awiyab.  “ God Almighty!” said Nosseyr. Hearing this Mu’awiyah turned his back upon  him in great anger, but he is said to have afterwards asked God’s pardon, and to  have implored his mercy upon the deceased.   Be this as it may, in one thing we find all historians agree, namely, that Musa  was a mauli of ’Abdu-l-’aziz Ibn Merwaén, of the royal family of Umeyyah, and  viceroy of Egypt and Africa in his brother ’Abdu-l-malek’s name. It was he  who gave him command in the army, promoted him, and appointed him at last  to the government of Cairwén and the African conquests. When the Khalif  Al-walid married his niece Ummu-l-baneyn,** Misa was intrusted by her father  *Abdu-l-’aziz with the care of taking her to the house of her royal spouse ; hence  the high favour he always enjoyed with the Khalif, until, by his death, things  were entirely changed.   There are not wanting historians, as Ibnu Bashktwal and Ibnu-l-faradhi, who  count Misa in the number of the ¢dbi’s (followers of the companions) of the  Prophet, asserting that he preserved many of the traditions delivered by the  individuals of that illustrious body, that he quoted Temim Ad-dari*® as his  authority, and was himself quoted by Yezid Ibn Masrék Al-yahsebi. This Ibnu  Bashkiwal affirms on the authority of Misa’s own son,*° who wrote a book with  the following title, Kitdbu-l-aymati mina-l-musanafin (a treatise on the principal  authors of traditional collections), in which he collected particulars respecting the life  of every one of them,—‘‘ a work,” observes Ibnu Bashkiwal, ‘ which is justly con-  “* sidered as the key-stone of the history of this country, and one which is consulted  ‘* and quoted by every student, whether young or old, whether noble or plebeian.”   All historians who have written the life of Misa agree in describing him as a man  of undaunted courage, and great abilities ; he was, they say, generous, mild, pious,     CHAP. Iv.] DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. 299    and was endowed with great penetration and prudence. Such were his military  talents that it was said of him that he never lost a battle. Al-hijéri says that ‘“ he  “ always surrounded his person with holy men, and virtuous friends, whom God  “ Almighty selected to be the instruments of his glory and power, as well as the  “‘ means of establishing the fame of Misa, a fame that shall last throughout day and  “night, and which the course of ages shall not impair; although it was tarnished in  “his days by his becoming the victim of that cruel enemy against whom a noble-  “minded man has no power, I mean envy and hatred, those two vices so common  “in people of narrow minds,—for nothing is more true than the words of that  “ captain who exclaimed—  : ‘ No captain ever stood against malevolence.’ ”   Al-hijari says that Misa was originally from Wada-l-kord, a town of Hejéz, that  he became a mauli of the Beni Merwan of Damascus, and that having gained some  celebrity by his military talents the Khalifs of that family appointed him to different  situations in the state, until, under the Khalifate of Al-walid Ibn ’Abdi-l-malek, he  was intrusted with the government of Africa proper, and more remote countries in  the West; that he penetrated to the utmost frontiers, and conquered Andalus,  entering it from the mountain called after him in the vicinity of Ceuta“! But  having been recalled to Syria by Al-walid, the indisposition and death of that Khalif  was the cause of all his misfortunes, since Suleyman, his brother and successor,  inflicted upon him a most severe chastisement, deprived him of his riches, and even  went so far as to send him to Wéda-l-kord, the place of his birth, in order that his  countrymen might harass and despise him. According to the same writer Musa  died at Wada-l-koré, in the year ninety-seven (beginning Sept. a. p. 715), as above  stated.   Tbnu Bashkiwal also mentions his death as having taken place at Wada-l-koré in  the said year, and adds, that his military science and talents for government were  sufficiently established by his conquests, as well as by the fact of his being  appointed in perilous times to the command of those Moslem settlements beyond  Egypt, and along the shores of the ocean between the country of the Berbers and  the country of Andalus ; and that, respecting his literary accomplishments, some of  his writings, in prose as well as in verse, were reckoned to be very good, and of  sufficient merit to class their author among those writers who have strung together  the pearls of speech. Ibnu Hayydn says that he was eloquent, and a master of  the Arabic language, and gives as a proof his conversation with Ibnu-l-mahlab, and  the answer he sent to the Khalif Al-walid. But let us hear Ibnu Sa’fd’s opinion on  the subject.   That eminent writer, after recording the different opinions entertained by the     300 HISTORY OF THE MOHAMMEDAN DYNASTIES IN SPAIN. [Book Iv.    historians concerning Miisa’s origin and early position in life,—some saying that  he belonged to the tribe of Lakhm, and was therefore of noble descent,—others,  on the contrary, that he was a Berber, and of mixed blood,—expresses himself  in the following words. ‘‘ Most of the historians of this country seem to entertain  “the opinion that Misa belonged to the tribe of Lakhm; but whether he was  “born an individual of it, or became a mauli in time, seems to be a very contro-  “‘ verted point. There can be no doubt, however, that he was a mauli of ’Abdu-l-  “ *aziz Ibn Merwan, the Khalif’s brother, and that his father, Nosseyr, had filled  “‘ charges of some trust under their predecessors of the house of Umeyyah. His  “« posterity, however, were famous for the command they held in their hands, so  “‘ much so as to have raised the suspicions of the Khalif; for by Mtsa’s appointing  ‘‘ his sons to the command of his conquests the whole of the Moslem dominions of  “ Africa and Andalus came to be divided among them,—’Abdu-l-’aziz governing the  “* Jatter country ; Abdullah, Africa proper ; and ’Abdu-l-malek, Western Africa.”   As to his freedmen, Tarif and Tarik, who undertook the conquest by his orders,  and the illustrious Arabs who accompanied him in his expedition to Andalus,  enough will be said of them in another part of the present work to satisfy the  curiosity of the reader and increase his information.",book_4,chapter_4
